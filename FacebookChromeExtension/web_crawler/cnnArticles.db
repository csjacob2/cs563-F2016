{"_id":" Axelrod: Donald Trump is 'epically thin-skinned'","articleText":" (CNN)Former senior adviser to President Barack Obama David Axelrod took Donald Trump to task Monday after he sent yet another tweet slamming the press. On CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Axelrod, who is a CNN senior political commentator, argued, Trump is \"epically thin-skinned,\" when it comes to the media. Earlier in the day, Trump sent a tweet that said, \"If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to 'tweet.' Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!\"\"I don't know any president who loves the press that covers him, because the job of the media is to take a critical look at the administration. But, Donald Trump is epically thin-skinned. And his notion is, 'if you write nice things about me' or 'if you say nice things about me then I will play with you but if not I will go over your head and tell my version of the truth,'\" Axelrod said. \"There's real danger in this for our democracy because part of the check on unbridled power is a free press and for a president to say 'I don't really believe in that,' is a little bit frightening.\" Trump has continued his anti-media narrative in the weeks following his electoral win and he commonly referred to the press as \"disgusting\" and \"dishonest\" on the campaign trail.

{"_id":"#ThatsNotLove: Helping teens spot signs of relationship abuse ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)Looking back, Mattis Collier, now 20 and a junior at the University of South Carolina, can see all the warning signs.\"It was a very quick relationship. I didn't know him very well ... but the jealousy, the rage, all of that stuff came pretty soon after,\" said Collier about her ex-boyfriend, whom she started dating early in high school.There was so much isolation, she says, remembering how he went through her phone one time, deleting all of her male friends in her contacts and on Facebook, and how he told her she couldn't talk to guys or go to parties.Reluctant to get too specific, she says the relationship was abusive in multiple ways. Ultimately, she cut off communication with him after she started college.\"I was very blind to the situation, and you know, when it's your first love and all of that, you really think that that kind of thing is, 'Oh it won't happen again,' or 'He was just so mad,' or 'I lied to him so I deserved that,' but it progressively got worse.\"This summer, Collier's father wore a \"One Love\" baseball cap to support the One Love Foundation -- an organization created in honor of Yeardley Love, the University of Virginia lacrosse player who was beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend just three weeks before she would have graduated in May 2010.Collier's father encouraged her to check out the foundation. \"I think that was his way of saying, 'I'm wearing this hat in honor of a girl that was not as lucky as you.'\" So one night she went up to her room and looked up every news article and video she could find about One Love, and made a decision to create a campus organization called Team One Love at her college this past fall. \"I was like, 'OK, if I don't do this for anyone else, I'm going to do it for myself.'\" There are now 40 active Team One Loves on college campuses across the country and nearly 6,000 Team One Love members. The goal is for the students to take the lead in educating and empowering their peers about the signs and dangers of relationship abuse. It's all part of a #ThatsNotLove campaign that One Love Foundation officially launched back in October.'Every kid has a stake in solving this problem'But this goes way beyond a campaign. The One Love Foundation hopes #ThatsNotLove starts a movement.\"I think the idea behind #ThatsNotLove is how can we think of a lot of different, creative ways to emphasize the same core message, which is that there is a difference between relationships that are about love and relationships that are about control, that you can see in some of the earliest phases of a relationship behaviors that are healthy and unhealthy,\" said Katie Hood, chief executive officer of the One Love Foundation.\"We're trying to sort of make this very clear, that every kid has a stake in solving this problem. Every kid has a stake in working for change and thereby make it easier for people to do so,\" she said. To drill that point home and get to teens and college students where they are -- on social media -- One Love worked with an outside agency to create \"couplets,\" eight digital shorts featuring animated emojis, which in a very clear-cut way indicate how intensity, obsession, isolation, disrespect, blame, control, anger and put-downs are most definitely not love.Since the couplets were launched this month in honor of Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Protection Month, they have been viewed nearly 5 million times and counting, according to One Love. \"They demonstrate exactly what we're trying to say with 'That's not love,' but they do it a lighthearted way,\" said Sharon Love, Yeardley's mother and the founder of the One Love Foundation. \"They're not threatening. They're very simple but they bring the point home directly.\"Added Lexie Love Hodges, Yeardley's sister: \"They can capture a whole relationship in five seconds.\" People don't always recognize relationship abuse when they read an article about it or listen to someone talk about it, she said, but here they can see the behavior demonstrated in a way they might click with. \"The topic of relationship violence is so heavy. I think that's why it's not talked about often and I think that the couplets ... make it more approachable for friends to bring it up in a different way,\" she said.In addition to the digital shorts, two public service announcements also titled \"That's Not Love\" have been released, and have been viewed more than 5 million times on Facebook and YouTube since October.'We were so clueless'Relationship abuse is an issue that was never discussed in her household, Sharon Love said during a phone interview from her home in Baltimore. \"We were so clueless,\" she said, adding that she and her family knew nothing about it and didn't feel like it was a topic they needed to be concerned about either. \"We didn't realize there were signs, and we're trying to turn that upside down. ... The signs are somewhat obvious but they're masked as love. You can think that they're madly in love with you when they're really just trying to control you.\"Love said she also had no idea about the statistics -- how one in three women and one in four men will experience some form of physical violence in a relationship in their lifetime, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and how young women 16 to 24 experience the highest rate of domestic partner violence -- nearly three times the national average. \"I feel like what we thought of domestic violence was of someone that was married with children, that was stuck in a situation, that was dependent on the abuser and couldn't get out,\" said Love, saying what came to mind was Farrah Fawcett's portrayal in the movie about domestic violence, \"The Burning Bed.\" \"That was like stuck in my head. That's what relationship violence is,\" she said.It didn't ever occur to her that relationship abuse could impact young people, let alone that young women in Yeardley's age group were at the highest risk.On May 3, 2010, when Yeardley was just 22 and weeks away from her college graduation, Sharon Love awoke to police officers at her front door. Life as she and her family knew it was completely over.\"It was incomprehensible to me that someone I knew, someone that Yeardley cared for, had taken her life,\" she wrote last year in a letter posted on the One Love Foundation website. (Yeardley Love's ex-boyfriend George Huguely was convicted of murder and is currently behind bars.)The MADD for relationship abuse? Determined to raise awareness among teens and help them recognize the warning signs of abusive relationships, Sharon Love started the foundation in the hopes of doing for relationship abuse what Mothers Against Drunk Driving has done for drinking and driving.\"They changed a whole mentality, with generations now thinking it's appalling to drink and drive. My generation didn't think anything of it,\" she said. \"So we're hoping that relationship violence will be appalling behavior and something that you speak up against right away.\"The foundation created a film called \"Escalation,\" which showcases a fictional relationship between two students, Paige and Chase, that starts to turn very wrong, very quickly. In the film, Chase wants to be with Paige all the time, gets jealous when she spends time with men, begins to isolate her from her friends and grows increasingly more angry and violent as she starts to pull away. The film has a tragic ending and concludes with photos of young women who in real life were killed by their abusive partners.I watched the film last year as it was being rolled out on college campuses around the country. It left me shaken and so upset. I watched it again before writing this piece and feel exactly the same way.So far, the film -- along with a 45-minute workshop led by student facilitators -- has been shown nearly 700 times at colleges and high schools across the country, with nearly 35,000 students participating. According to Hood of One Love, nearly 90% of students who participated in workshops said they thought it should be required viewing at their school, and 97% said they would recommend it to a friend even if it wasn't required.'Rocketed' to understandingThe goal, an ambitious one, is to have 100% of students on every campus in the U.S. see the film and participate in a workshop, said Hood. \"Because movement is our goal, we just want as many eyeballs to see it as possible,\" she said. \"We now think that if ultimately we want to change the social climate on campuses, so that people can speak up when they see things, then it can't just be a pocket of kids that see it. It has to be many, many more.\"I wondered why One Love wouldn't just release the film on YouTube and allow teens across the country and around the world to see it. Hood said there are two reasons. First, it could be triggering for someone who is an abusive relationship, she said, and you would want to make sure there were resources available or you could communicate to that person what resources are available when they watched it. And second, she said, while the film is powerful, the workshops are more powerful.\"You walk in, you think this has nothing to do with you. And in 38 minutes, which is the length of the film ... you're sort of rocketed to not only understanding the issue, being more aware of it, you recognize that you've seen it before,\" said Hood. \"You have a connection to it.\" Because ultimately, that's part of the sad reality of relationship abuse. We all most likely know someone who has experienced this.\"It doesn't discriminate. It's not just poor people. It's not just people without fathers or mothers or guidance. It's everybody. It's your sorority sister. It's your friend. It's your sibling. It's your child,\" said Mattis Collier, who hopes to be able to work with One Love after her graduation in December and then go to law school to work on the issue of domestic violence in college athletics.\"And I think it's very important for people to realize that you need to talk about it and you need to explain it while you're younger. It's not just bruises that are giveaways for an abusive relationship. ... It's how someone talks to you. It's how someone treats you. It's how someone talks about you to others.\"Showing people they have a role to playCollier wishes the \"Escalation\" workshop were required at her high school and college. Right now, just over 40 schools require it with a subset of students, including athletic teams, fraternities and sororities, and freshmen, according to One Love.\"I wish that this was a required seminar for high school, for college students, because the lack of knowledge and education awareness in our country is astounding,\" said Collier.As One Love looks to the future, it hopes not only to increase the number of schools where \"Escalation\" workshops are held and also increase the number of schools where they are required, but also to deepen the engagement of students, with more Team One Loves -- more students like Collier facilitating workshops, training students to be workshop facilitators and holding \"That's Not Love\" events where they write words on sheets to match what love is and what it is not.\"It may sound crazy to have these ambitious goals about starting a movement and getting to 100% of the kids on college campuses,\" said Hood, \"but it's sort of pretty simple what we're trying to do. We're trying to just wake people up to their personal connection and get them to develop their voice and understanding that they have a role to play.\"What drives Sharon Love and the rest of her family is trying to prevent what happened to Yeardley from happening to any other young person in a relationship.\"I feel pretty confident already that we are saving lives,\" she said. \"We've gotten so many letters from so many people that have gotten out of a bad situation, and really just one of those letters makes it all worthwhile.\"What do you think is the best way to try to prevent relationship abuse among teenagers?

{"_id":"$1,000 fine for taking supplies to Dakota pipeline protesters","articleText":" (CNN)Anyone taking supplies to the activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline now face a $1,000 fine -- all part of the attempt to dislodge activists from camps set up there.First, the US Army Corps of Engineers warned that activists who refuse to leave the camps could face arrest. That was last week and since then, officials have backtracked, saying they have no plans to forcibly remove anyone. Now, the North Dakota governor, Jack Dalrymple, is taking a different tack. He's ordered protesters to clear out immediately, because winter's coming. He said the temporary dwellings pose serious public safety concerns. And the $1,000 fine is part of that approach.The Morton County Sheriff's Department could not be reached for comment. But this is how spokeswoman Maxine Herr explained it to CNN affiliate KFYR in a statement:  \"Any person who chooses to enter, reenter, or stay in the evacuation area does so at their own risk, and assumes any or all corresponding liabilities for their unlawful presence and occupation of the evacuation area.\"What that means, she says, is \"if delivery trucks are observed going into the evacuation area they will be notified that they are guilty of the infraction and could receive up to a $1,000 fine if they continue.\"Herr said authorities will be \"passively\" enforcing the governor's order, meaning there will not be a roadblock, but anyone entering the area will be notified that they are trespassing and penalized.The $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline project -- which would move 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states -- has been vigorously protested for months by environmental activists and members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who say it will affect drinking supplies and place downstream communities at risk of contamination from potential oil spills.Protesters have vowed to stand their ground.CNN's Max Blau, Kait Richmond and Marisa Russell contributed to this story.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/us/pipeline-protest-fines-trnd/index.html"}
{"_id":"'A beam of new hope': Taiwan reacts to controversial Trump call ","articleText":"Taipei (CNN)When asked what he thinks about Donald Trump, Taiwanese politician Freddy Lim responded with a laugh.\"I am not a fan,\" he said, particularly when it comes to the incoming US President's comments on women and ethnic minorities. It's not that surprising, given that Lim, lead singer in a popular heavy metal band, is one of Taiwan's most progressive legislators.Yet when Trump accepted an official call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, Lim was delighted. He hopes the call is just the beginning.\"I would definitely love to see that he would retain his outspokenness, especially if he can use it to make a breakthrough in terms of traditional restrictions on Taiwan-US relations,\" he said.Note of cautionMany in Taipei welcomed the call between Trump and Tsai, the first publicly reported direct contact between a United States President or President-elect and a Taiwanese leader in 40 years. With the positivity though there is also a heavy dose of pragmatism, part of life on an island stuck in a political quagmire like no other.Lo Chih-cheng, a legislator and member of the DPP, Tsai's party, said that Trump has shown \"a very friendly attitude towards Taiwan, but how we can translate into policies is still unknown.\"As a small player stuck between giants, he believes Taiwan needs to proceed carefully.White House: Trump Taiwan call could 'undermine' progressThe Communist government in Beijing views Taiwan as a \"renegade province,\" since Chinese nationalists fled there and established a government after losing the civil war in 1949. Both governments claim to be the legitimate ruler of all of China, but Taipei effectively controls only Taiwan and a few other small islands. Over the decades Taiwan has turned into a vibrant democracy with freedom of the press and speech, unlike China.While the US is a strong ally of Taiwan -- selling it billions of dollars worth of weapons to help with defense -- but has no official diplomatic relations with the island. This is part of the \"one China\" policy, a carefully managed and strategic arrangement designed not to anger Beijing. Taipei divided on TrumpOrdinary Taiwanese were optimistic about the call. Housewife Yang Lo-hsia told CNN she believes Trump's call could lead to a closer relationship with the US and hopefully in turn a stronger commitment to the protection of Taiwan. \"It's like a beam of new hope,\" she said.IT worker Howard Wu welcomed the call because he doesn't like China, calling the country  \"too powerful and too aggressive.\"On the campus of National Taiwan University, some students were cautiously optimistic about the call while others were unaware it had even happened. Several expressed concern the US was trying use Taiwan for its own political goals.\"I think Donald Trump simply used Taiwan as stake for negotiation with China,\" said psychology student Peng Yu-Chuan. She does believe building a stronger relationship with the United States would be helpful though, because \"with all this suppression from China now the international space for Taiwan is getting smaller and smaller.\"Hsu Tzu-Yao, a material sciences major, did not see the call as important to his life in Taiwan. \"I think the key is to preserve your sovereignty and your own set of values,\" he said.Changing Taiwanese IdentityAttitudes towards China are changing in Taiwan. Polls show that over the last two decades, many in Taiwan have come to identify themselves as Taiwanese, instead of Chinese or both Taiwanese and Chinese. In 2016, just 3.6% of those surveyed identified as solely Chinese compared to 25.5% in 1992, according to the Election Study Center At NCCU. \"I really don't think that we belong to the same country,\" said graduate student Llao Heng-yi, adding that she is very proud of Taiwan's freedom of speech. Trump and China on collision courseLim, the politician, co-founded a youth-driven party that now holds five seats in the legislature. He said he believes Taiwan's young people see a future not focused on China and that it's time for Taiwan to move on from the past and work towards \"normalizing things, both internationally and domestically.\" He hoped the Trump call was just the beginning. For DPP legislator Lo, it's a chance to think of the relationship in a new way.\"US policy towards Taiwan is a function of US policy towards China. I don't think that's fair, you know, we have to take Taiwan seriously for its own sake,\" he said.

{"_id":"'Creation engineering': The art and science of naming drugs","articleText":" (CNN)Yearly lists of the \"most popular baby names\" show how tastes change over time. While Jennifer, Heather, Michael and Jason may have been favorites in decades past, today's top contenders include Emma, Olivia, Liam and Noah.The same applies to pharmaceutical drug names. \"Aspirin,\" for instance, was a name with legs in the early 20th century. Bayer branded its pain medication with this simple moniker in 1899 and sold it around the world for years. By the end of the century, though, drugs were named with a \"blockbuster\" edge and struck very different chords. The late 1990s was the era of Celebrex and Viagra as well as the now-infamous OxyContin.More recently, drugs have reached for even more exotic sounds. Within the past few years, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved Farydak for treating multiple myeloma, Avycaz for abdominal infections, Vraylar for schizophrenia, Idelvion for hemophilia, Luzu for athlete's foot and Byvalson for high blood pressure.Saying these names aloud, some may hear a strange and lovely music, while others may imagine aliens arriving from distant planets. Similarly, naming a drug is a complicated process.The power of three A branded prescription drug is actually known by three names. The pharmaceutical company gives a new drug a chemical name based on a set of rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. For any drug that will be marketed in the United States, the next step is obtaining a name from United States Adopted Name Council. It assigns the active ingredient of the drug a generic name, which must be cleared and reviewed by the International Nonproprietary Name program run by the World Health Organization.\"This step assures that there is one non-proprietary (generic) name throughout the world for the drug,\" explained Stephanie C. Shubat, director of the Adopted Name Council.With the generic name settled, a pharmaceutical company proposes a brand name to the FDA, to mark the product as its own.For example, an antidepressant is known in the lab by its chemical name: N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]propan-1-amine. The generic name assigned to this complex chemical is fluoxetine. To the rest of us, the drug is commonly known as Prozac. \"Prozac is what I call the Big Bang of pharmaceutical naming. It came out of nowhere, it means absolutely nothing, and it really just said, 'Wow, OK, this is blockbuster naming in the drug world,' \" said Scott Piergrossi, vice president of creative development at the Brand Institute, which names, tests, markets or otherwise works on about 75% of FDA-approved names each year and about two-thirds of the global names. David Wood, a pioneer in the field of branding and founder of Wood Worldwide, named Prozac in the early 1990s, before he sold his shop to InterbrandHealth. Today, Prozac even appears in the Oxford English Dictionary.According to R. John Fidelino, executive creative director at Interbrand, it was the first drug name that took both a condition and its treatment \"out of the shadows.\"Prioritizing safetyThough each step of the naming process presents hurdles, approval for a brand name is the most difficult to clear. \"The FDA's Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis is responsible for proprietary name review prior to approval,\" explained Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the agency, noting that this division can \"require the company to select another name, for safety reasons, as part of the approval process.\" Two departments within the FDA -- the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research -- scrutinize each proposed name and then reject about 20% and 35% of the names, respectively.If reviewing names seems an unnecessary form of regulation, consider that the Institute of Medicine estimates that more than 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured or killed each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing and taking medications. Meanwhile, a study published this year in the British Medical Journal found that 251,000 people die each year in the United States from medical error or medical care gone wrong, including drug name and dosage mixups. Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, say the study authors, making the goal of everyone in this industry to avoid what they call LASAs: lookalikes, sound-alikes. \"Name safety is now the number one priority, and predicting name approvability is now the name of the game,\" said Arlene Teck, creative director at Ixxéo Healthcare, a name engineering agency. \"The FDA wants to protect any American, traveling anywhere, from any kind of harm that could come from confusing one drug with any other drug or even a local food supplement.\"The possibility of drug name confusion keeps regulators up at night. Because they can nix any proposed name, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and HealthCanada exert the strongest influence on drug names, according to Teck. In fact, she says, we are living in \"the regulated age of drug naming.\"   And for those who believe that computerized prescriptions will reduce mistakes caused by illegible handwriting, a white paper (PDF) commissioned by the FDA found that lookalikes still cause mistakes when prescribers accidentally choose a similar drug name from a drop-down menu.Global influencesThe FDA has a whole host of reasons why it might require a different name than the one selected by a company.  For instance, the use of certain word \"stems\" are officially protected by the International Nonproprietary Names program.  Word stems are groups of letters, usually just two -- \"os,\" for instance, or \"aj\" -- that cannot appear within brand names, explains Teck, as it might cause confusion with a generic name.The FDA also rejects names that seem too fanciful or overstate a drug's effectiveness and puts the kibosh on names that might stigmatize a patient (or condition).\"If you are wanting to do metaphors that are life-affirming, and you want to think of things like trees or flowers or something strong like metal, you cannot do that, because it might suggest an ingredient,\" Teck noted. The global nature of the pharmaceutical industry presents additional challenges. A name may be approved by the FDA and then rejected by European or Canadian authorities.\"To anticipate both the FDA and European Medicines Agency regulatory outcome, that's really the number one mission of any team or any agency,\" said Denis Ezingeard, Teck's naming partner and CEO of Geneva-based Ixxéo. If you fail, says Ezingeard, \"you're down to square one.\"Even once a product is commercially launched, the FDA retains the authority to request a name change. In fact, the agency may request a name change if doctors report confusion and medical errors even after a drug can be found on the shelf at your local pharmacy.Naming drugs, says Ezingeard, is all about avoiding regulatory pitfalls and has become \"less and less\" about creation. After all, recovery from rejection, which could take a long time when coordinating the process across different countries, is costly and difficult. Because of the many rules and regulations, pharmaceutical naming has become highly specialized work that is mostly farmed out to highly specialized creative agencies. The creative processHaving developed strange and elaborate defenses to avert the disaster of rejection, namers resemble emus, those awkward birds that run instead of fly. Most agencies begin the process by playing the numbers game.For any assignment, the Ixxéo team creates between 2,000 and 5,000 names. \"That makes pharmaceutical naming different from consumer branding, where the constraints are not as stringent and where you can turn a much lower wheel of names,\" said Ezingeard, who refers to himself as \"Dr. Destructo.\" His job on the team is name elimination, because his primary concern is to \"get out of the way\" as many names as possible \"that are by their nature\" a possible liability. In the end, 10 are selected as \"promising\" from the original 2,000 or 3,000, and from there, the final selection of one name begins.The Brand Institute then typically submits two names at once to regulatory agencies, according to Piergrossi.\"But there are layers of contingency names in place, especially with Big Pharma planning years in advance,\" he said, adding, \"we are well-versed in what's required by the regulators.\"  Another way the Brand Institute's subsidiary, the Drug Safety Institute, avoids rejection is by assessing name candidates using a methodology similar to those used by regulatory authorities. For example, FDA examiners are known to look at handwritten samples of a drug name and listen as a variety of people (each with different accents) pronounce the name. They also check for illegal stems, similarity to the names of discontinued products, and common medical or coined abbreviations tucked within the name. Meanwhile, examiners analyze for possible promotional claims and references to active or inert ingredients within the sound of the proposed name.Ixxéo has developed its own \"regulatory engineering model\" that mirrors the \"complex and evolving set of parameters\" used by regulatory authorities. \"It's the very model the FDA could have built, but they didn't do it,\" Ezingeard said.Beyond the rules Like poets who write Elizabethan sonnets rather than free verse, pharmaceutical namers must make difficult decisions based on arcane rules, but their work is still a form of artistry.Teck says Ezingeard, an engineer and polymath, developed Ixxéo's elaborate naming process when he was studying Darwinian evolution. \"Creation engineering,\" as Teck refers to the drug-naming process, is based on evolutionary science as well as art history and merges creation with the screening process.  In practice, this means swapping names back and forth between Teck, Ezingeard and Ignasi Fontvila, a colleague in Barcelona. Together, they craft names blended from English, French, German, Spanish and Catalan linguistics and based on four distinct dimensions:  visual distinctiveness, melodic contrast, verbal velocity -- how it sounds when spoken within a sentence -- and language neutrality, which is the ability to work across many different languages.Teck and Fontvila then develop a final list of name candidates and tweak each other's to ensure a higher chance of approval.Teck is legendary in the industry for naming Viagra while at Wood Worldwide in 1992. To name Pfizer's blockbuster, she ran a focus group with urologists who treated erectile dysfunction. At the conclusion of the session, Teck asked one of the doctors what it felt like for men when the condition went away. The doctor said, \"Visualize a strong stream.\" Melding the words \"vigorous\" and \"Niagara,\" Teck came up with \"Viagra.\" Neo-linguistics Now an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary, Viagra is an example of how a name can \"fundamentally create, not just change, conversation,\" Interbrand's Fidelino said.\"Prior to Viagra, impotence was a psychological disorder that went to the core of how men defined themselves,\" he said. \"By creating a brand that is named in a way that allows people to discuss it, and creating language or using language to describe the condition in a way that makes it easier for people to engage in conversation, you had more people seeking treatment and also improving sexual health and relationships around the world.\"Later, Interbrand was tasked with creating a moniker for what's now known as Cialis, a second-to-market impotence drug. But naming a drug that is not first to market is difficult because \"the name of the game is being unprecedented ... being the breakthrough,\" Fidelino said. He explains that the goal was to find a sound that fit with Cialis' improvements over its predecessor, the macho-sounding Viagra.Cialis' treatment window is longer than that of Viagra -- it works throughout the day -- so if an opportunity arises, a man can spontaneously respond. This unique attribute and improvement over Viagra required \"new messages and a new framing,\" said Fidelino, who says naming drugs is about naming \"the invisible, the intangible.\" The resulting approach for Cialis was more about relationships and less about sex. \"A different type of emotion is conveyed by Cialis,\" rhapsodized Fidelino, noting that it's a \"tonally softer\" name and more elegant. Of the many names created by the Brand Institute, Piergrossi says he is proudest of Latisse, the eyelash growth drug from Allergan. This name was crafted by merging two words: \"lash\" and \"Matisse,\" the French painter and sculptor. Latisse is marketed directly to consumers, so the name must appeal to those who will use the product. Names intended for doctors are often a play on words or technologies familiar to them or suggestive of a drug's mechanism of action.  For instance, the hepatitis B and C drug Pegasys, explains Fidelino, is based on a pharmaceutical technology known as pegalation.\"There's no doubt that there's virtue in the unusual,\" said Fidelino, but still, it's helpful \"when there's a real tie-back either to the attributes of the product, the technology of the product, the benefit of the product or the intended outcomes.\" All the namers acknowledge that this is far easier said than done. In the current consumer climate -- often hostile toward Pharma, according to Fidelino -- it's incumbent upon these companies to help people appreciate what they do.This can be achieved, Fidelino believes, by going beyond the tricks and instead creating brands and marketing campaigns with real depth:  \"I'm also a health care consumer,\" he said. \"I don't want to see the public being duped by fancy, superficial promotions.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/health/art-of-drug-naming/index.html"}

{"_id":"'Edge of Seventeen' a coming-of-age movie for the selfie generation","articleText":" (CNN)Hailee Steinfeld became a child star to watch in \"True Grit,\" and delivers on that promise in \"The Edge of Seventeen,\" a coming-of-age movie that owes a debt to John Hughes films but establishes its own voice for the selfie-and-sexting generation.Related: What's on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon this monthThere's nothing particularly distinctive or new about writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig's take (working with veteran producer James L. Brooks) on one very surly, confused young girl. Steinfeld's Nadine lost her father at a young age and has mostly been making life hell ever since for her frazzled mother (Kyra Sedgwick) and older brother (Blake Jenner), who is perfect and popular in a way Nadine finds utterly revolting.Nadine has survived her teens thanks largely to her closeness with one friend (Haley Lu Richardson), whose crush on her brother suddenly complicates their relationship. Much of Nadine's angst, meanwhile, is unloaded in protracted, breathless bursts on a teacher (a very funny Woody Harrelson) who does all he can to create the appearance of being completely unconcerned, but who obviously cares more than he lets on.Craig hasn't exactly sought to reinvent the wheel. Indeed, the basic description and tone in some respects echoes the 1990s TV drama \"My So-Called Life,\" as Nadine lashes out in predictable ways. Those include pining for a mysterious, slightly dangerous classmate and befriending a nerdy one (Hayden Szeto), while, in her self-absorption, ignoring his obvious if awkwardly expressed feelings for her.Still, it's all played sensitively enough, as Steinfeld -- a 19-year-old actress clearly on the edge of stardom -- conveys her character's emotional tumult and self-pity without becoming as annoying as teenage protagonists often are, or as Harrelson's teacher likes to pretend that she is.\"Maybe nobody likes you,\" he deadpans when Nadine barges into his classroom and starts complaining.\"Edge of Seventeen\" might wind up as a mere footnote to Steinfeld's career, but it represents a significant transition from her debut to its next phase. Beyond proving that she was no one-trick pony, if this sort of work continues, one suspects a lot of people are going to like her.\"The Edge of Seventeen\" premieres November 18. It's rated R.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/entertainment/edge-of-seventeen-review/index.html"}

{"_id":"'Fantastic Beasts' unleashes a so-so Harry Potter spinoff","articleText":" (CNN)\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" turns out to be a hyperbolic name for a pretty so-so movie -- one with entertaining passages, but which mostly feels like a big-budget prequel to the better, more cohesive film that's yet to come.Of course, \"Fantastic Beasts\" actually is a prequel of sorts, plucked from the rib of the Harry Potter franchise, marking the first screenplay by J.K. Rowling. Working with veteran \"Potter\" director David Yates and starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, the author has delivered a handsome but disjointed introduction to Newt Scamander, a British wizard who travels the world in pursuit of magical creatures.Awkward and shy in the way genius academics can be, Newt seems to come alive when he's interacting with these CGI wonders, which he inadvertently unleashes on New York upon his arrival in 1926. Through a series of mix-ups, he's aided in part by a local Muggle (Dan Fogler), who quickly becomes his wide-eyed, comic-relief sidekick, despite a law among the American wizardry that any \"No-Maj\" must instantly have his or her memory wiped (or \"obliviated\") if exposed to the wizardly world.But that's just half the story, which takes its sweet time getting to the meat of the drama. The real threat involves a malevolent force that a local wizard cop, or auror (Colin Farrell), hopes to locate, release and control, although the logistics of all that, frankly, remain rather fuzzy.Faster than you can say Dumbledore, Newt's beasts, and the havoc they wreak around New York, produce several elaborate action sequences, and the visuals are both playful and dazzling. (It's worth noting that while a lot of the beasts are cute, there's plenty of darkness too, and some situations would likely be scary for younger Muggles.)Nevertheless, \"Fantastic Beasts\" generally feels strongest in its quieter moments, including Newt's sweet, tentative interactions with Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), who chafes at having been demoted from auror to a clerical role and bravely decides to help him.Erecting a new movie franchise of this magnitude around \"Fantastic Beasts\" is certainly enterprising, gleaned from a textbook that Harry and the other Hogwarts students read. But that's precisely the sort of digression in which a book can indulge that can become ungainly -- as the film does for the first hour or so -- when fashioned into a theatrical blockbuster. For that reason, while the audience spends a lot of time with Newt, we learn relatively little about him.Given the pent-up hunger for \"Harry Potter,\" and perhaps greater demand for pure escapism, the movie should be a major holiday attraction, without rising to Harry's heights. That's still good news for Warner Bros., which, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.Still, \"Fantastic Beasts\" doesn't consistently conjure a level of magic equal to its promise or anticipation. About the best that can be said about it, in fact, is having cracked open Newt's book, there's enough here to whet one's appetite for whatever wonders might be found in the next chapter.\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" opens in the U.S. on November 18. It's rated PG-13.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/entertainment/fantastic-beasts-review/index.html"}
{"_id":"'French Thatcher' Francois Fillon wins France's Republican primary","articleText":" (CNN)French conservatives have picked Francois Fillon as their presidential candidate in next year's election. Fillon easily beat Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppe in the Republican party's first ever US-style primary runoff Sunday, getting about 66% of the vote. \"Victory is mine. It is a substantive victory built on belief,\" Fillon said as he spoke to supporters after his win. \"We have all the assets to be a modern, sovereign nation in the lead in Europe.\"Fillon could face far-right National Front Party leader Marine Le Pen in the final round of the presidential vote next spring, as voters are widely expected to boot out the Socialist Party that has ruled France since 2012 under the leadership of President Francois Hollande, whose popularity is waning.\"This past presidential term has been pathetic,\" Fillon said in criticizing Hollande. \"It is time to end it and start moving forward as we have never done in 30 years. For this we will need everyone.\" Fillon, 62, is a lawyer who served as prime minister between 2007 and 2012 under Sarkozy. He's a social conservative who has talked of ending France's famed 35-hour work week and getting tough with the country's powerful trade unions. He has also spoken of cutting public spending, abolishing the wealth tax, reducing immigration and investing billions in security, defense and justice.A hard line on immigration has also bolstered Le Pen, whose anti-Europe stance is gaining popularity among French voters. In an interview with CNN last week, she said she'd been emboldened by Donald Trump's surprise victory in the United States. \"It makes the French realize that what the people want, they can get, if they mobilize themselves,\" she said.Fillon's sudden riseJust a month ago, Fillon was considered an unlikely bet for the presidency, but he won over voters with a polished performance in televised debates.Polls had him mostly in third place, but he apparently struck a popular tone in the country's fight against Islamic terrorism and ISIS after publishing a new book, \"Beating Islamic Totalitarianism.\"The first round of the primary, on November 20, put Fillon well ahead, with 44.1% of the vote. Juppe received 28.6% and former President Nicolas Sarkozy came in third with 20.6%, eliminating him from the final round. French newspaper Liberation morphed Fillon's face with Thatcher's in a cover image this week -- no doubt inspired by the Republican's tough talk on unions and pledge to cut 500,000 jobs from the civil service.As a Catholic from Le Mans, a city in northwest France, Fillon symbolizes the traditional provincial right. The father of five lives with Welsh-born wife Penelope in a 12th-century castle near where he grew up. Fillon also is a race car enthusiast who once appeared on France's \"Top Gear\" TV program. Fillon's main rival, Juppe, is also a former prime minister, under President Jacques Chirac. He had been seen as a reliable and experienced politician, and a moderate, but was tainted by scandal, including a 2004 prison sentence for corruption.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/europe/french-republican-primary-runoff/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Frozen,' Marvel and more: Hong Kong Disneyland's huge expansion plans ","articleText":" (CNN)Are the icy powers of \"Frozen\" stars Elsa, Anna and Olaf magical enough to draw tourists back to the world's smallest Disney resort? Hong Kong Disneyland execs certainly hope so. In an effort to renew interest in the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which has experienced a drop in visitor numbers, Disney has announced a multi-year, $1.4 billion development plan that includes new themed areas, attractions and entertainment. Hong Kong Disneyland said in a statement there would be new attractions launching almost every year, from 2018 through 2023. Among the highlights is a new \"Frozen\" themed area featuring rides, dining, shopping and entertainment based around the characters and stories from the kingdom of Arendelle. It's due to open in 2020. First up: Iron Man ExperienceOther expansion plans include a new Marvel Super Heroes zone. This will compliment the new Iron Man Experience, which officially opens on January 11, 2017. The Iron Man Experience features a multi-sensory immersive motion ride that allows guests to soar through Hong Kong's skies alongside Iron Man and battle the evil forces of Hydra.  There's also a mock Stark Expo, where Tony Stark will show off his latest high-tech creations in various exhibition halls. Though further details on the Marvel zone are sparse, the announcement did say the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters would be reimagined into a brand new experience that allows guests to fight alongside the icons of the Marvel Universe. Other highlights in the expansion plan include a transformed castle and hub area to showcase brand new daytime and nighttime shows and an \"Adventureland Show Place.\" At the latter, guests will be able to check out shows at \"Moana's Village Festival\" and meet Moana, heroine of the new Disney animated film due for release this month. \"We are more excited than ever about the future of Hong Kong Disneyland,\" said Bob Chapek, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, in a statement. \"We are bringing the best of The Walt Disney Company to this wonderful tourist destination, giving guests from around the world an experience only Disney can deliver and an experience they can only have with us at Hong Kong Disneyland.\"In terms of new accommodation offerings, the Disney Explorers Lodge resort hotel will open later in the first half of 2017.

The Theme Park Guy weighs inHong Kong government footing more than half the billFor many Mickey Mouse fans in the region, Hong Kong's Disneyland has become an afterthought following the flashy opening of the massive Shanghai Disney Resort in June of this year.   The expansion might give them reason to come back. According to Disney's statement, the plan will be funded by Hong Kong Disneyland's shareholders -- subsidiaries of the Walt Disney Company and the Hong Kong Government, which owns a 53% stake in the park.This means the shares of the project funded by the company and the government will be approximately $650 million and $750 million, respectively, subject to funding approval by both sides.   According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the expansion is expected to create 5,000 to 8,000 jobs across the tourism industry.  \"Despite dwindling tourist numbers, [Commerce Minister Greg So Kam-leung] expects the park's new offerings to help attract up to 9.5 million visitors annually by 2025, up from 6.8 million in 2015,\" says the SCMP report. \"The expansion comes after the park's first descent into the red in five years and large-scale layoffs earlier this year.

{"_id":"'Gilmore Girls' actor on revival: 'I was a little nervous at first'","articleText":" (CNN)Thanks to his work as Kraglin in Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" Sean Gunn has had his fair share of exposure to a notoriously passionate group -- comic book fans. But even they, he said, aren't quite as fervent as fans of \"Gilmore Girls.\" \"The 'Gilmore Girls' fans might be crazier, which is insane to even say that,\" Gunn, who played Kirk, told CNN in a recent interview leading up to the Netflix revival of the beloved show. \"It's weird to see the parallel between 'Gilmore Girls' and a lot of the Comic-Con-type, sci-fi-fantasy fans. In a weird way, even though 'Gilmore Girls' is not in that genre, the way the fandom conducts itself and has created this community is similar.\" That community is a big part of why the series is seeing a second life. Despite wrapping up its run in 2007, the love for \"Gilmore Girls\" has never really died. If anything, it grew thanks to Netflix, who made all the seasons available for streaming in 2014. Netflix greenlit a revival in January, a few months after much of the cast reunited at the ATX Television Festival in Austin to much fanfare. RELATED: 'Gilmore Girls' follows TV's nostalgia wave to NetflixGunn was not at the Austin event, but remembers hearing rumblings about a possible return in the weeks and months that followed. He thought it was \"strange and exciting.\" \"It was very, very cool,\" he said. \"I'm ready to see what the fans think of it — how much they like it.\"Four \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movies debut on Netflix November 25. Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and most of the supporting cast will reprise their roles. \"I was a little nervous at first, sure,\" Gunn said of stepping back into quirky Kirk's shoes. \"Then I walked onto set and I'm walking around and here I am in Stars Hollow and everything looked exactly how I remembered it looking ... he came back pretty quickly.\" The hope is also that the warm, joy-filled feelings fans got from watching the original series comes roaring back, too.With creator Amy Sherman-Palladino back at the helm -- she was not part of Season 7 -- chances are they will. But also, Gunn said, the show's message about community is still one that resonates. \"I think the idea that the community you live in is an extension of your family is a really nice thing for people to think about and to wish for in their own lives,\" he said. \"The idea that a place like Stars Hollow exists, that's safe and comforting and the people there actually look out for one another, that's what appeals about the show to me.\" ","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/entertainment/netflix-gilmore-girls-sean-gunn/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Gilmore Girls' follows TV's nostalgia wave to Netflix","articleText":" (CNN)Did anyone really need a \"Gilmore Girls\" revival? No more so than an updated \"Full House,\" which doesn't mean the practice isn't smart business-wise for Netflix -- not just tapping into nostalgia, but offering fans an excuse to revisit old episodes.Enter \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" four 90-minute installments -- length-wise the equivalent of about eight TV episodes -- served up as a bountiful Thanksgiving weekend binge. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has reassembled practically the entire gang (with the sad absence of the late, great Edward Herrmann), plus some bonuses, kicking off with \"Winter\" and proceeding through the seasons.Netflix loaded up its screeners with detailed spoiler warnings, which seems silly given the contours of the exercise. All that really needs to be said -- not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run -- is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces.Those include Lorelai's mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner's Wi-Fi access.The four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren't on the radar when the show signed off, like \"Game of Thrones\") but moving the plot along at a snail's pace.So while there's plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long.Those pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run.Granted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn't gaga for \"Gilmore\" during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters -- or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions -- is probably reward enough.Netflix's pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it's so obviously designed to bolster the \"If you just watched\" part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner.It's hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact \"Gilmore Girls\" has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that's because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like \"Gilmore Girls\" isn't a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow.\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" premieres November 25 on Netflix.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/entertainment/gilmore-girls-review/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Hamilton' is Trump's dead cat","articleText":"Kate Maltby is a theater critic for The Times of London and regular broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics. She is also completing a Ph.D. in renaissance literature, having been awarded a collaborative doctoral between Yale University and University College London. Her website is www.katemaltby.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)There is a story, popular among British politicians and attributed to the Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, known as \"The Dead Cat.\" A CEO is confronted with poor statistics at a board meeting, and to divert attention from this unpleasant news, he suddenly pulls out a dead cat and throws it onto the middle of the table.In the words of Boris Johnson, now the UK foreign secretary: \"There is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the table -- and I don't mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. The key point... is that everyone will shout, 'Jeez, mate, there's a dead cat on the table!' In other words, they will be talking about the dead cat -- the thing you want them to talk about -- and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.\"Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump unveiled a particularly malodorous dead cat. In the past week, he had agreed to settle the Trump University lawsuits for $25 million, with a potential additional $1 million in penalties forthcoming. The suits alleged Trump defrauded people who enrolled in real estate seminars he started in 2005.  Meanwhile, his new DC hotel was marketing its services to diplomats keen to please the new President. As one diplomat told The Washington Post: \"Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new President, 'I love your new hotel!' Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'\" The link between presidency and personal profit was laid bare for all to see. After all this, Trump's dead cat strike should have been predictable. On Friday night, Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical \"Hamilton;\" by Saturday, Trump had taken to Twitter to denounce the musical's performers for being \"very rude\" to his future Vice President. In fact, as video evidence shows, cast member Brandon Victor Dixon had read out a scrupulously polite statement of the inclusive values celebrated in the performance; it gave the impression of having been filtered through so many Broadway PR flacks as to be rendered entirely uncontentious. Some audience members seemed to boo either Pence or the performers -- it's hard to tell on video -- but Dixon insisted: \"There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo. We're all here sharing a story of love.\" Reframed by Trump on Twitter hours later, this became an act of harassment against Pence. By Sunday morning, the President-elect was on back on social media demanding an apology from the actors who, he said, had offended the Vice President-elect (Pence himself later indicated he was not offended). Trump has a history of reframing civic criticism as harassment. One is reminded of his vicious misrepresentation of President Obama's own approach to protestors. Sadly, few controversies could have served Trump so well. Liberal Twitter may not like it, but Trump has won every battle he's picked in the ongoing culture wars. \"Hamilton,\" with its hit soundtrack and vision of an America founded by immigrants, has inspired people of color across the United States who may never see the stage show. Even a photograph of a black actor embodying George Washington has impact. But it has nonetheless come to epitomize the elitism of a New York City subculture in which patrons can afford to spend upwards of $1,000 on secondary market tickets. While its celebration of racial diversity is received wisdom in NYC, (\"immigrants -- we get the job done!\" runs one of its most famous chants), perhaps it is more alien to some white voters in, say, Maricopa County, Arizona. And though theater lovers were quick to mock the Trumpistas who threatened to \"Boycott Hamilton\" (the play is sold out until August 2017), snarky promises to hoover up any unwanted tickets are unlikely to heal America's gaping social divides. In the spirit of furthering this divide, both Trump supporters and opponents have suggested that Mike Pence could have expected nothing less than an evening of left-wing politics in choosing to attend \"Hamilton.\" It is a show about political protest, yes (\"I'd rather be divisive than indecisive,\" raps Hamilton.) Yet it is not quite so simple. \"Hamilton\" is ultimately all about meritocracy, a hip hop celebration of \"winner\" culture. Had Trump chosen to attend himself, he might have found it spoke to him. After all, his daughter Ivanka tweeted in March that she had finally seen the musical and loved it. Presumably she is not one of those who, as her father insisted in yet another tweet on Sunday morning, have let him know that \"Hamilton\" \"is highly overrated.\"Indeed, it was brave of Dixon and his colleagues to engage at all with a presidential team which has shown a consistent fear of open criticism. It is easy to mock New York actors for grandstanding; harder to accept that Trump's bullying now carries with it the threat of a future President's retaliation. Press reporters write of intimidation by supporters at his campaign rallies. The same spirit now threatens the theater. At a Chicago performance of \"Hamilton\" on Saturday night, a protester interrupted the performance to shout profanities in support of Trump: the producers are concerned that the next Trump fan in the audience will be violent. Freedom of expression is suddenly a hot-button American issue. The problem for those who oppose Trump is that by turning the attention of the Twittering classes to a spat with a theater, the President-elect has diverted attention away from his other egregious headlines.In this climate, it is the responsibility of editors, reporters and Twitter to ensure that those headlines about such things as potential violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which states that no politician accept any kind of gift from a foreign dignitary, remain the top story. As John Stuart Mill argued in \"On Liberty,\" freedom of expression is the freedom on which all other civic rights are based. Allow a US president to censor the language of actors by intimidation, and he'll soon be giving newspapers the same treatment. We may prefer our newspapers to cover corruption allegations than to waste space defending a few mouthy actors. But if we don't defend the right of actors to criticize a president, the next generation of journalists will have a harder time campaigning against corruption themselves.Donald Trump has thrown a dead cat onto a table to divert attention from allegations of corruption. But when a dead cat is a threat to freedom of expression, we should still be shouting about it.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/opinions/trump-dead-cat-hamilton-maltby/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Hamilton': The latest feud Trump won't let go","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump isn't letting slights go -- even after the ego-boosting accomplishment of winning the presidency. As the Republican President-elect greeted candidates for Cabinet position at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course Sunday, he couldn't resist another shot at the cast of the musical \"Hamilton\" -- which had read a message directly to Vice President-elect Mike Pence after he attended the Broadway production Friday night. With Pence looking on silently, Trump told reporters the remarks were \"very inappropriate.\" It marked the second straight day of Trump, now back in control of a Twitter account aides had wrested away in the closing stages of the campaign, raging against \"Hamilton.\" And more importantly, it was a continuation of Trump's months-long penchant for lashing out after ego-bruising moments. Those outbursts have most often come on Twitter, and include his criticism of Megyn Kelly following her sharp questioning in the first GOP primary debate and his attack on a 1996 beauty queen's weight after Hillary Clinton cited her in a debate. The \"Hamilton\" episode shows Trump's tactics aren't changing, even though he won.Trump is currently interviewing candidates to form his Cabinet, receiving his first intelligence briefings and beginning to develop relationships with congressional leaders to enact his policy vision for America. But on Sunday, the first words he offered were about Hamilton. \"The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\" Trump tweeted at 6:22 a.m. ET. At 8:26 a.m., Trump had another bone to pick -- this time with NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" which lampooned him as only now realizing the gravity of the presidency in its opening skit. \"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" he tweeted. But \"Hamilton\" -- the critically acclaimed musical about the nation's founding fathers -- has been Trump's most frequent target. On Saturday morning, in one tweet, Trump wrote: \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!\" In another, he said: \"The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\" The remarks offered a stark reminder of Trump's sensitivity -- and showed how his expectations contrast with how he encouraged supporters to treat journalists covering his rallies, protesters against whom he encouraged physical violence and opponent Hillary Clinton, who he threatened to jail. The Twitter tirades did serve to draw attention away from his $25 million settlement of lawsuits alleging that Trump University was a fraud. It was no master plan, though: Trump tweeted about that settlement, too, drawing even more attention to it.On Monday, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway explained why Trump tweets.\"He has over 25 million followers on Facebook and Twitter, and it's a great way for him to take his message directly to people and cut through the noise or silence,\" she told Chris Cuomo on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"Sometimes, important things he's saying or doing are getting zero coverage. Sometimes, he's just trying to cut through the nonsense of people telling Americans what is important to them, which we saw through the elections wasn't true,\" she added. \"People constantly being told this issue, this statement, this past transgression is important to you and Americans said, 'No, it's not. What is important to me is this 100-day plan where he'll drain the swamp and repeal and replace Obamacare and pass meaningful reform.'\"But there are some signs Trump is trying to rein in his Twitter behavior. He deleted a tweet posted at 7:32 p.m. ET Saturday -- a full 12 hours after he'd begun attacking \"Hamilton\" -- that said: \"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" On the campaign trail, Trump said he wanted to change laws to make it easier to sue his critics -- a move which, free speech advocates warned, could lead to a chilling effect that would silence political expression. The American Civil Liberties Union lambasted Trump's attacks on the \"Hamilton\" cast, portraying Trump as unaware of the realities of his political office. \"President-elect Trump needs a refresher on his high school civics class,\" said Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU's executive director. He said it's Trump -- not the cast of \"Hamilton\" -- that should offer an apology. \"Americans don't apologize -- not even to presidents or vice presidents -- for the lawful and proper exercise of their constitutional rights,\" Romero said. \"The First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy, and Democratic and Republican presidents alike have understood that freedom of speech makes our country stronger -- even if it sometimes make our leaders uncomfortable.\"Trump's tweets have amplified the comments from a cast member, read on-stage after the production. Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the hit musical, began the message by thanking Pence for attending the play and saying, \"We hope you will hear us out.\" \"We, sir -- we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" Dixon said. \"We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\"Pence, for his part, has let the comments go.\"I did hear what was said from the stage. I can tell you I wasn't offended by what was said. I will leave to others whether that was the appropriate venue to say it,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"I do want to say that the basic element, the center of that message is one I want to address and that is I know this is a very disappointing time for people that did not see their candidate win in this national election,\" Pence said. \"I know this is a very anxious time for some people. I just want to reassure people what President-elect Donald Trump said on election night -- he absolutely meant from the bottom of his heart,\" he said. \"He is preparing to be the President of all of the people of the United States of America and to watch him bringing together people of diverse views, bringing people together who disagreed with him strongly, seeing him talk to leaders around the world, I just want to reassure every American that in the days ahead I am very confident that they are going to see President-elect Trump be a president for all of the people and we embrace that principle. We are going to work hard to make that principle every day that we serve.\"The \"Hamilton\" cast's message to Pence came after some in the crowd booed the Republican Vice President-elect. Pence said he did notice the booing, but it didn't spoil the show. \"My daughter and I and her cousins really enjoyed the show. 'Hamilton' is just an incredible production, incredibly talented people. It was a real joy to be there,\" Pence said. \"When we arrived we heard a few boos, and we heard some cheers,\" he said, \"I nudged my kids and reminded them that is what freedom sounds like.\" ","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/donald-trump-hamilton-feud/index.html"}

CNN interviewed some Muslim Americans who reveal how complicated it has become to practice their faith in a country they love.The rapper shaping young mindsAlia Sharrief has many identities. She's black, she's Muslim, she's a hijab-wearing hip-hop artist.If you ask Sharrief about her identity, she'll tell you instantly that she loves being black and Muslim. There's even a popular hashtag called #BeingBlackandMuslim that she uses regularly on social media to show her pride.But being black and Muslim isn't the same as being just Muslim, she says.\"I deal with the struggles of Islamophobia and the prejudices against black people,\" she says. Stories about African-Americans like Eric Garner and Michael Brown dying in police altercations have hardened the Oakland, California, resident.A majority of Muslims in the United States are immigrants or children of immigrants. Among Muslims who were born in the U.S. about 40% describe themselves as African-American, according to a 2011 report by the Pew Research Center. Many of these African-American Muslims converted to Islam.That's the case for Sharrief's parents. Her mother and father grew up as Southern Baptists in Mississippi and Georgia, respectively, before converting to Islam in their teenage years after the civil rights movement.Sharrief has found ways to combine her faith with her African-American heritage.The 26-year-old elementary school teacher is also an up-and-coming rapper. She has opened for hip-hop artists like Grammy-winner Kendrick Lamar in the past. But Sharrief challenges the stereotypes of mainstream hip-hop artists by sporting a headscarf and spitting out lyrics about Islam and the Prophet Mohammed when she's performing.Her music often surprises audiences. They've never seen a hijab-wearing Muslim woman rap before. \"I hear, 'Wow, I haven't heard anything like this,'\" she says. The audience's excitement makes her want to keep talking about Islam.Sharrief teaches second and third-graders at a Muslim charter school in the San Francisco Bay Area. Sometimes, she shares her music with her students. They love it and always request to hear more.She's trying to reclaim the American Muslim narrative through her work, she says. She wants to highlight all the good things Muslims are doing around the world, like when Muslims raised about $50,000 to rebuild burned African-American churches in the United States back in June 2015.But it feels like she's starting over whenever there's a terrorist attack in the name of Islam, she says.After Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot and killed 14 people during a holiday party in December in San Bernardino, California, about a six-hour drive from Oakland, Sharrief felt nervous walking around the Bay Area. She noticed people looking at her hijab, which made her uncomfortable.\"When (San Bernardino) happened, I heard things like, 'all you Muslims are dangerous,'\" she says. \"I have never had a thought like that. I have never wanted to hurt someone.\"Her best weapon against the violence is her music, she says. \"There are so many stereotypes about Muslims, and I want to say: 'Hey, I come in peace. We don't believe in this stuff.'\"The medical student at the Christian schoolThe nerves were already kicking in.Madiha Khan had been waiting more than two hours for the most important interview of her life.So many things were running through her head: \"Will I like it here? Will they want me here? Will they care that I'm different?\"This was Khan's first interview at the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Liberty University. She chose her words thoughtfully. She wanted to be a doctor. She wanted to help people.Then one of the faculty members asked a question that gave her pause: \"How do you think you will fit in here?\"Liberty University is a staunchly conservative school in Lynchburg, Virginia. Saying that it has deep Christian roots is an understatement. Southern Baptist pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell founded the university decades ago, and it has become a pit stop for many conservative politicians. Republican candidate Ted Cruz announced he was running for president on campus in March 2015, and Donald Trump was endorsed by Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the late televangelist, in January.With her fair skin and hazel eyes, Khan blends in well on campus. But she's a Muslim with Pakistani origins. Liberty sounds like the last place a Muslim student would want to be at, but Khan liked the university's religious identity, she says. The 23-year-old was drawn to Liberty's beliefs.\"I'm not a Christian, but I share the same values as this school,\" she remembers saying during the interview.There's no drinking on campus, and students are expected to dress modestly. Those were some of the little things that spoke to Khan, who grew up in a relatively non-practicing Muslim household in the New York City borough of Queens.It's been about six months since Khan started school, and she's one of six Muslims who she knows of on the graduate school campus, which can be challenging when it comes to practicing her faith at school.She'll get stares as she prays in a corner of the graduate school's library between classes. Usually, her peers are curious. Her Christian classmates strike up conversations with her about Islam, and most of the time, they find similarities between the two faiths, rather than differences.\"Meeting me and my roommate, who is also Muslim, I think it's changing my peers' worldviews,\" she says.Although she feels like she has dispelled a few misconceptions about American Muslims, every terrorist attack by an extremist feels like another step back.\"One of the first things I thought when I heard about the San Bernardino shootings was, 'please don't let them be Muslim,'\" she says. \"It's sad to say that out loud, but the atmosphere keeps getting worse, and I feel helpless.\"Shortly after the San Bernardino shooting in December, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students during a ceremony that they should arm themselves. \"I always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walk in and kill,\" Falwell said during the event. Those words spurred energetic applause from thousands of college students at the weekly convocation.In a phone interview with CNN after the convocation, Falwell said he wasn't talking about all Muslims, just those who perpetrate attacks.Ibrahim Hooper, the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN in December that Falwell's comments were discriminatory toward American Muslims. \"It's part of an overall toxic anti-Muslim atmosphere that we're seeing, particularly in the past few weeks with Paris and San Bernardino,\" Hooper said. \"Anti-Muslim bigotry was still on the fringes after 9/11. But it's moving toward the mainstream thanks to Donald Trump, Ben Carson and these types of comments.\"Khan, a graduate student at the medical school, wasn't at the convocation when Falwell made those comments. But it took her only minutes to find out from her friends and family.\"My parents called that night and told me to not walk alone on campus at night,\" she says.\"Honestly, I was mad,\" she says. She was scared and upset, but she wasn't surprised. \"I'm not naive. I knew coming here that it would sort of be like this; that I would have to explain who I am and what I stand for, and that I would be seen as different,\" she says.As someone who is part of a relatively new osteopathic medicine program at the university, Khan had hopes that she could set a positive example for American Muslims. \"I had this idea that maybe I can change the culture here,\" she says.Even though Falwell's comments scared her, they aren't stopping her from pursuing her degree or being an advocate for Muslims on campus. \"If I can educate a Christian kid about what it's like to be a Muslim person, that means a lot to me,\" she says.And in many ways, Liberty University has made Khan stronger too. Since starting the osteopathic medicine program, being around her Christian classmates has given her a sense of appreciation for who she is, Khan says.\"When I'm around people who are unapologetic about their faith, I think that that is how I want to be,\" she says. \"I think it has made me a better Muslim, actually.\"'The only Muslim family in town'The grassy plains of Worland, Wyoming, seem to stretch forever. The mountains, the valley, the world here look endless.But when you're one of the few Muslim families in a town of 5,500, Worland can feel like a pretty small place. The son of Pakistani immigrants, Hamid Khan grew up in this northwestern Wyoming city along the Bighorn River during the 1980s.There wasn't a mosque in town back then. Holidays like Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr were observed in the privacy of their home. And as a teenager, he was one of the few Muslims his friends met in school.Although Muslim families were rare in Worland at the time, most residents were curious about the Khan family. What did they eat? What were their traditions? What did they believe in?But Khan, now 39, says that curiosity is being replaced by fear. In December, his cousin died of cancer. When Khan and his family held an Islamic funeral in Colorado for his cousin, gunshots were fired from a truck driving by at the memorial service.\"They said 'F*** you, rag heads' and drove off. It was terrifying,\" he says.As an adjunct professor at the University of South Carolina, Khan teaches about Islam and Islamic law. He says that every presidential election, anti-Muslim rhetoric seems to bubble to the surface.There's research backing up his observation. Dalia Mogahed, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on Muslim issues, says studies suggest anti-Islamic sentiment becomes more prominent during presidential election years, as some politicians, influencers and media personalities try to take a harsher stance on Muslims to show their hawkish side.\"It's hurtful to think that those who are seeking the highest offices in the land are ignoring the basic tenets of the Constitution and suddenly concluding that Muslims have a predisposition for violence,\" Khan says. \"It feels like we're a punching bag.\"Being a Muslim doesn't make a person any less American, Khan adds.That's what he wants his four kids, all under the age of 12, to remember. A few months ago, his new teaching job brought him and his family to an even smaller town than the one he grew up in. Blythewood, deep inside the historically red state of South Carolina, has about 2,000 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. Census.When they first arrived, Khan immediately wondered whether his kids would stick out. \"Teachers on day one were struggling with their names,\" he says.But even in this small town deep in the Bible Belt, there have been a lot of positives for the family, Khan says. Recently, administrators at his children's school asked him to come in and speak about Islam after learning about his career and seeing him speak about the topic on local television.\"If that is the silver lining and I get a little more traction in South Carolina, so be it.\" Khan says.America is his family's home, and they aren't going anywhere.\"I am you. Your neighbor, your teacher, your friend and a fellow American.\"The Brooklyn dad and the homemade clockSyed Meer was in junior high when the Iran hostage crisis unfolded.In November 1979, Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage and holding 52 of them for 444 days. The crisis is often described as the United States' first brush with political Islam.It was also when the kids at his Boston school started calling Meer \"Ayatollah.\"It feels like the attitudes toward Muslims have only gotten more hostile since the '70s, the 49-year-old says.Anecdotal evidence suggests that 2015, studded by violent attacks by extremists in the name of Islam at home and abroad, was one of the most anti-Muslim periods in U.S history, according to a survey by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Some politicians have proposed policies singling out Muslims in response to attacks by terror groups like ISIS​ that have spread beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has proposed temporarily banning Muslims immigrants from entering the country and increasing surveillance of mosques in the United States.This sort of rhetoric is creating an unwelcoming atmosphere, says Meer, a motion graphic designer of Indian descent.\"It feels like the West versus Islam,\" he says. Meer, who has called America home for decades, is scared; not for himself, but for his kids. He doesn't want Islam to be associated with a violent narrative because of how others portray the religion.\"My 14-year-old son was joking with my wife and said every student should have a Muslim lab partner, because if something blows up, they have someone to blame,\" he says. \"That was hard to hear.\" Meer isn't ashamed of being Muslim, and he doesn't want his kids to be either.After Texas teenager Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school, Meer instantly thought about the impact on his own kids. His kids play games like Minecraft and enjoy tinkering with projects. One of his sons is passionate about the maker movement, a do-it-yourself movement for inventors, designers and hobbyists, and another wants to build a jet pack someday.Meer fully expects that his kids will one day build their own version of a homemade clock or a different project, and he can't help but think about how others will react. \"I don't want them to be afraid,\" he says.The unapologetic Texas mamaMehnaz Mahmood wasn't like the other girls at her elementary school in the suburbs of Houston.She came to class dressed in frumpy homemade clothes sewn by her Bangladeshi mother. Her brown skin made her stand out against her mostly white classmates, and she sometimes felt a little clueless about American traditions.\"I was sort of a FOB,\" she says. That's short for \"fresh off the boat,\" a phrase used to joke about immigrants.Most kids assumed Mahmood was Mexican, until they heard her name. It has been more than two decades, but the 33-year-old homemaker in McKinney, Texas, still remembers the first time she felt like an outsider because of her faith. She was in the third grade, introducing herself to one of her classmates, Mahmood recalls.\"I told her my name, and I remember this girl made a face and asked me, 'What kind of name is that?'\" she says.\"I said it was a Muslim name. Then she said, 'Muslim? Oh, you guys are terrorists,'\" Mahmood says.Those words were like a slap in the face.She encountered similar feelings after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Her neighbors were skeptical of her and she remembers the stares she got from strangers.About half of Muslim Americans say it has become difficult to practice their faith since the 2001 attacks, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey. Mahmood thinks that sentiment still holds true in 2016. After seeing so many news stories about the terror and destruction caused by groups like ISIS and Boko Haram, Mahmood is frightened for her kids, her family and her country, too.\"That isn't Islam. They are terrorists,\" she says.It's a lesson she's trying to teach her kids. Mahmood is the mother of a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. She doesn't want them to be ashamed of their faith. For her daughter Noreen's ninth birthday, she gave her a children's book about women in Islam. It's adorned with a golden cover and intricate drawings of paisleys.At night, before bedtime, they read stories about strong women in Islam, like Khadijah, the Prophet Mohammed's first wife. Islamic scholars say she was an older widow and a businesswoman before she remarried to Mohammed. Mahmood wants her kids to know their religion is rooted in helping people, not hurting them.\"I want them to be seen as strong, good human beings,\" she says. \"If faith helps them, then I hope that they are ambassadors for our faith.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/us/muslims-in-america-irpt/index.html"}
{"_id":"'I have to text my rapist': Victims forced to parent with attackers","articleText":" (CNN)Trapped in a bad dream. That's how an 18-year-old Noemi felt when she learned that she had no choice but to hand over her baby daughter to the man convicted of assaulting her. Noemi's child was conceived in the assault, and Nebraska's laws on parental rights forced her to agree to court-sanctioned visits between her daughter and her attacker. For Noemi, who asked CNN to protect her privacy by not using her last name, it amounts to putting the most cherished part of her life in harm's way. Her biggest fear is that her child will \"get hurt or something bad will happen to her,\" Noemi told CNN's Lisa Ling. \"I can't tell what he will do to my daughter.\"Noemi's story isn't unusual. Across America, there are state laws that don't protect women who became pregnant through rape from being forced to share their children with their rapists.A common problemExact stats aren't tracked, but there are an estimated 17,000 to 32,000 rape-related pregnancies in the United States each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. About 32% to 50% of impregnated rape victims keep their babies, according to various studies. Those estimates would put between 5,000 and 16,000 women at risk of falling into this legal limbo every year, depending on where they live and where the attack took place.\"Increasingly, people are coming out and saying, 'This has happened to me,' \" said Rebecca O'Conner of RAINN, the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network. 'Forced to parent with him'In Noemi's case, this real-world nightmare is not only frightening but frustrating. Setting up visits between her child and her attacker has become an emotionally difficult part of daily life. \"Now, I have to text my rapist or email my rapist,\" she said. \"To leave my daughter with someone I didn't trust. (I'm) forced to parent with him and to see him on a weekly basis ... to talk to him about my daughter's school activities and her health.\" Trying to find a way out, she said, nearly brings her to tears. \"I think I'm stuck in this situation because he gets that right from the state, and there's nothing that we can do.\"In 2011, Noemi was -- in her words -- a \"very naive\" high school student with a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant in Norfolk, Nebraska. \"I had no idea what sex really was,\" she said. \"I was just so inexperienced.\"One night after her restaurant shift, a co-worker invited her over to his house, she said, and raped her.After discovering that she was pregnant, Noemi briefly considered an abortion. But \"after I went to the doctor and I heard her heartbeat, it was kind of hard to say no,\" Noemi said. It wasn't her daughter's fault that she was conceived in violence.Her attacker was charged with first-degree sexual assault but was able to plead to a lesser charge of third-degree sexual assault. Under Nebraska law, Noemi could terminate her attacker's parental rights if he'd been convicted of sexual assault in the first degree. But because he was convicted of third-degree assault, his parental rights were safe. When Noemi applied for state medical assistance for her daughter, she was asked to name the father, and the state requested child support from him. Five months after Noemi gave birth, her attacker began demanding regularly scheduled visits with his biological daughter. Eventually, Noemi's attacker won unsupervised visits with his daughter for a few hours every other weekend and two Tuesdays each month. Though horrified, Noemi really didn't have much choice. How your state views parental rights for rapistsThe question of conviction Of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, fewer than half have laws that allow the termination of parental rights to rapists without a conviction.In some of those states, Noemi's attacker could be blocked from visiting her daughter if there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that he raped her -- no conviction of first-degree sexual assault necessary.    Laws with this clear and convincing evidence standard allow termination of parental rights if evidence is presented in family court that the father committed sexual assault during conception of the child.A family court judge would rule if the evidence was \"clear and convincing\" under civil law. For example, this could include witness testimony that the defendant committed rape, as long as the defendant didn't have a solid alibi.For pregnant rape victims, requiring criminal convictions makes terminating their attacker's parental rights very difficult. Rape is notoriously under-reported to police and ends in relatively few convictions. About 19% of raped women over 18 report their rapes to police, according to the National Institute of Justice (PDF). Only 37% of reported rapes result in criminal prosecution. Of those, only about 46% result in conviction. How we got hereThis whole legal mess is rooted in laws that were written more than half a century ago, experts say.Back then, society didn't legally acknowledge parental rights for children who were born to unmarried women -- \"or, to use an antiquated term, 'born out of wedlock,' \" said Multnomah County, Oregon, Circuit Court Judge Katherine Tennyson, president of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. \"So traditionally, laws didn't take into account how was the child was conceived.\"Attorney Shauna Prewitt, who also became pregnant from a rape and chose to raise her child, believes society has created a \"biased prototype ... that all pregnant, raped women hate their unborn children.\" This point of view fueled an assumption that these women would have abortions or give up their children for adoption -- which obviously would make the concept of co-parenting unnecessary. All this, experts say, has left the 21st century with a big legal disconnect between parental custody laws and laws governing rape and sexual assault. What's being done?Next year, Noemi plans to testify before Nebraska lawmakers considering legislation aimed at protecting her and thousands of other mothers from being forced to share their children with rapists. She's already preparing her testimony and hoping to help change the law in her favor. The battle to enact rape laws allowing termination of parental rights has also been raging in Maryland for years. \"A man who conceives in the course of a sexual assault should have no rights to the child or family contact. Committing a crime does not make you a father,\" said Maryland state Sen. Jamie Raskin, who sponsored a bill that ended up stalling in the legislature. This issue is seen as a matter of state and not federal law because it's never been challenged in the US Supreme Court. \"What we're talking about is a family law proceeding,\" said Raskin, who was just elected to his first term in the US House of Representatives. \"The family law judge could make the decision that the father shouldn't have parental rights without waiting for a criminal conviction.\"How one woman changed her state's stance on parental rights for rapistsSupporters plan to try again to pass a similar bill in Maryland next year.'More pain in a painful situation' Is there ever a scenario in which a convicted rapist who served his punishment and genuinely demonstrated reform should have the opportunity to be a father?That's a tough question, Tennyson said. \"While everyone would like a law that works for every situation, that's not always possible.\" Sometimes, the solution doesn't lie in the law itself, she explained, but in the hearts of the parents who are involved. \"Some acts are not acts from which you can recover. The bigger act is for someone to acknowledge that they should not have a role in a situation that might cause more pain in an already painful situation,\" Tennyson said. Prewitt said it's important to keep in mind the impact that co-parenting would have on the mother, who always would be confronted with the trauma of her rape. \"It has a really negative affect on women. They're more likely to abuse alcohol; they may not be able to hold a job. ... All these kinds of issues might arise,\" Prewitt said. \"It's more like suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. And when you have two parents who cannot co-parent ... you have a certain situation where one parent's rights have to fall away. In this circumstance, it should be the one who committed the bad act.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/rape-parental-rights/index.html"}

As a member of ISIS, he must follow the instructions of his local emir or commander. The order: to help kill a man in cold blood.As directed, al-Azy drove a fellow ISIS militant to the home of a SWAT member, an elite unit of the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service.The 23-year-old sat in the car as his co-conspirator stepped out of the vehicle, then shot and killed their victim.At the time, al-Azy says he felt proud of the murder, but now sitting in handcuffs, he told CNN he regrets his actions and believes they were wrong.Al-Azy is one of three men who spoke to CNN exclusively from inside a Kurdish-run prison at an undisclosed location in northern Iraq.This is unprecedented access to a group of men who all admit they played a role in an ISIS attack on the Iraqi city of Kirkuk in October.The commando-style raid involved a couple of hundred ISIS fighters, at least two suicide bombers, and local sleeper cells. It left 96 people dead and was considered by many a distraction from the battle to recapture Mosul, ISIS's stronghold in Iraq.Each of the three men CNN spoke to played very different roles and held varying degrees of closeness to the terror organization. Together, their stories draw a picture of how the organization functions on a local-level at a time when it is fighting for its very survival.All three of the men say they agreed to speak to CNN and were not coerced by the Kurdish officials that run the detention center. Each remains under investigation for their crimes.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/middleeast/isis-secret-prison-interview/index.html"}

They huddled together, shielding each other. They sent text messages to their loved ones, messages that would be their last goodbyes. A mother of one of the victims told Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff's office that she woke up on Saturday morning to a gutting message from her daughter on her phone. \"I'm going to die, mom,\" it said. Kelly also confirmed a San Francisco Chronicle report that another victim had texted a similar message to their family: \"I'm going to die,\" it said. And then, \"I love you.\" Kelly told CNN some of the 36 victims of the blaze were found hugging each other, as if to protect each other. He said some of those that had succumbed to the flames and smoke had time to think about their deaths.Such stories of survival and loss have started to emerge following Friday's tragedy. One survivor, filmmaker and photographer Bob Mulé, told CNN he had to leave behind an injured friend as he fled because the smoke and heat became overwhelming. \"I had to leave him there,\" he said. The warehouse was the site of an artists' collective known as The Ghost Ship, and many of the victims were either associated with the group or with the local creative community; musicians, tech professionals, students and free spirits.READ MORE: What was Oakland's Ghost Ship?

The actors are train wrecks.\"Their adventures on the road were the genesis of \"Kings of Con,\" in which the two play actors but not themselves. Benedict's character is going through a breakup, while Speight's has been divorced three times. Despite their messy personal lives, the characters get a lot of love from their fans.\"The 'Supernatural' conventions are, unto themselves, a really unique experience, different, I think, than even Comic Con,\" Benedict said. \"The fans are so loyal.

{"_id":"'Make America White Again': Hate speech and crimes post-election","articleText":"We are (regrettably) updating this page on a regular basis. (CNN)Fears of heightened bigotry and hate crimes have turned into reality for some Americans after Donald Trump's presidential win. And the list of incidents keeps growing.  The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the United States between November 9, the day after Election Day, and November 16.\"They've been everywhere -- in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street,\" the center's President Richard Cohen said this week.Critics accused Trump of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia during the divisive presidential campaign. Recent days have witnessed ugly episodes of racist or anti-Semitic, pro-Trump graffiti along with threats or attacks against Muslims. The President-elect has said he was \"so saddened\" to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities.\"If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,\" Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\"In a video statement released Friday, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said FBI statistics for 2015 showed a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans. Hate crimes against Jewish people, African Americans and LGBT individuals also increased. Overall, reported hate crimes spiked 6%, but the number could be higher because many incidents go unreported, Lynch said. \"These numbers should be deeply sobering for all Americans,\" she said. \"We need you to continue to report these incidents to local law enforcement, as well as the Justice Department, so that our career investigators and prosecutors can take action to defend your rights.\"   And it's not just incidents of hate crimes that have happened since the election; there have been reports of other attacks, too. A man in Chicago reportedly was beaten as a bystander yelled, \"You voted Trump!\" And two men in Connecticut were arrested over assault allegations against a Trump supporter.Here's what some Americans are dealing with across the country:INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE AFTER TRUMP WIN'Go home' scrawled on carA Puerto Rican family's car was vandalized on November 17, with the words \"Trump\" and \"Go home\" scratched into the car in West Springfield, Massachusetts, according to police and one of the victims, who spoke to CNN. Jorge Santiago, an Army veteran who has served two deployments overseas, noticed scratches in the family's red sedan after he put his daughter on the bus to school, said his wife, Toni Santiago. He reported the vandalism to the West Springfield police soon afterward, she said.West Springfield Police Department Capt. Daniel Spaulding said detectives are following up and the investigation is ongoing. They have not determined whether it was a hate crime.The Santiagos are the only minority family on their street, Toni Santiago said. Their family supported Hillary Clinton during the election, but they didn't have any signs on their lawn,  Santiago said. They have one small Clinton sticker on their other car parked in their driveway closer to the house, which was not vandalized, Santiago said. \"It is terrible. It is horrific, and still, in a way, I'm not surprised,\" Santiago said. \"Racism was always there, but I feel now with our current President having been so vocal in some of the things he says, people feel more comfortable showing that racism, and our family was a target of it.\"Both Toni and Jorge are US citizens, Santiago said. Jorge was born in Puerto Rico and has lived in Massachusetts for many years, Santiago said. Toni grew up in Massachusetts and is a social worker in nearby Holyoke, Massachusetts, she said. They have three children, ages 2, 8 and 12. Toni posted a photo of the vandalism to Facebook and shared it with CNN.\"My first reaction is we need to get this out. We need to do something,\" Santiago said. \"People think 'it's not going to happen in my town,' or Massachusetts is a liberal state, but this is real hate, and it's not OK.\"Uber driver verbally assaultedA motorist in a white SUV unleashed this hateful rant last week at an Uber driver in New York City.The Uber driver, a Muslim and a US citizen originally from Morocco, captured the incident on video. It occurred in the Astoria section of Queens on November 17.The Uber driver told CNN the motorist cut him off, yelled at him and continued to follow him for a few blocks.When they both pulled up to a stop, the man asked the Uber driver to roll down his window. The motorist then spewed profane and racist abuse at the man.One quote: \"Trump is president a******, so you can kiss your visa goodbye, scumbag. They'll deport you soon, don't worry, you f***ing terrorist.\" The Uber driver, who came to the United States about seven years ago, asked CNN that his name not be used over concerns for his and his family's safety. Chris Cody, the Uber driver's next passenger, asked him how his day was going. The driver explained what had just happened and showed Cody his video, Cody told CNN. Cody asked if he could post it on social media and share it with others, he told CNN. Later that day, Cody put the video on his Facebook page, writing, \"this is not a political post... this is a post about the disgusting mentality that some uneducated & xenophobic Americans somehow still subscribe to in the 21st century.\" The video has gone viral.Vandalism at Adam Yauch ParkSwastikas and the word \"Go Trump\" were painted on playground equipment at Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn, according to New York police spokeswoman Annette Shelton. The park is named after the late Adam \"MCA\" Yauch, a founding member of the pioneering rap band Beastie Boys.  The vandalism was discovered Friday afternoon, according to Shelton. A resident reported it to police, who are investigating the incident.  New York City Councilman Brad Lander, who represents that part of Brooklyn, wrote on Twitter: \"Yet more hatred & anti-Semitism from Trump supporters.\" He also tweeted, \"No place for hate. We will not be cowed.\"On Twitter, the Beastie Boys asked fans to join local officials Sunday morning at a rally in the park.  \"Hate has no place in Brooklyn, NYC, or America,\" the tweet said. \"Join us ... to stand against hate messages.Lander told CNN the graffiti had been painted over. Instagram images show hearts and flowers over the graffiti.  The swastika discovered Friday in a Brooklyn park was the 13th reported in the city since Election Day, according to Robert Boyce, chief of detectives for the New York Police Department.Other swastikas have been found in a school in Manhattan and a housing development in Brooklyn, Boyce told reporters. The number is up from two in the same period of time in November last year, Boyce said. According to the New York police, the number of hate crimes in the city has increased 31.5% in the year to date from 2015 to 2016 -- up from 250 to 328. Hate crimes targeting Muslims are up from 12 to 25, and hate crimes targeting Jews are up from 102 to 111, the police said. Boyce said the swastika at the Brooklyn playground was the only one that included Trump's name. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters this week, \"A lot of us are very concerned that a lot of divisive speech was used during the campaign by the President-elect, and we do not yet know what the impact of that will be on our country.\"A note with obscenitiesA woman reported a frightening incident that happened while she was hiking at Mission Peak in Fremont, California.  Nicki Pancholy had her car windows smashed and her purse stolen. A note containing obscenities and a reference to her \"hiljab\" was left on the car's windshield, according to CNN affiliate KRON-TV in San Francisco.Pancholy has Lupus and wears a bandana to protect her from the sun. It has no religious significance, she said.  A hijab is the traditional head covering worn by many Muslim women. \"I was surprised, I was taken aback by the ignorance,\" Pancholy said on \"CNN Tonight\" on Friday evening.  \"It breaks my heart that violence is spewing everywhere,\" Pancholy said. \"It makes me wonder what our children will be facing, how will they cope with this? It's a different America that they're experiencing something that's new to this generation.\" A swastika, the words 'Trump' and 'die' painted on carIn Denver, a transgender woman's car was spray-painted early Wednesday morning with a swastika and the words \"Trump\" and \"die,\" among other derogatory terms. Amber Timmons, 43, noticed the swastika as she was heading to her car to leave for work. She didn't make it to work that day. \"You get shocked, you don't believe it's going to happen to you,\" she said.Before the vandalism, she had the words \"love trumps hate\" written on her back window, and #notmypresident on the windows of the rear doors. And she intends to put those messages back on.\"Me and a couple of really good friends got together and got the spray paint off,\" said Timmons, who does not intend to press charges.Her message to the perpetrators?\"That it's OK,\" she said. \"It was done out of fear. That's what hate is. Hate is fear. And we can fix that fear by love. It's OK. I forgive them.\"The Denver Police Department's Hate Crimes Unit is investigating the incident as a possible act of criminal mischief, though there are no suspects at the moment.  'Build the wall' chanted at high school tournamentStudents from a small border town in northwest Texas say they were the target of ethnically charged slurs while warming up for a regional volleyball tournament.\"When they were saying 'Build that wall' and holding the Trump sign, we knew it was for us,\" Fort Hancock High School junior Jenna Aguilar told CNN affiliate KVIA-TV in El Paso after the game last week. Most of the school's students are Hispanic.Amid the verbal abuse from the stands, apparently from supporters of the Archer City team, Fort Hancock coach Melissa Saldana called a timeout. \"We've got to ignore what's going on. We've got to stay focused and we've got to get tough,\" Saldana said she told her players.  The Fort Hancock team lost, but Saldana said they were still victorious.  \"My girls, they rose above and they handled themselves very well,\" Saldana told KVIA.The superintendent of the Archer City Independent School District apologized for the students' actions, but Fort Hancock's schools chief is still upset. \"What troubles us is that no game official, an official at the venue, even the officials at the game, school officials, nobody stood up to put an end to this,\" Fort Hancock Independent School District Superintendent Jose Franco told the station.'Make America White Again,' softball dugout readsNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a joint investigation after someone painted a dugout wall in Wellsville, about 80 miles southeast of Buffalo.  The message: A swastika, surrounded by the words, 'Make America White Again.\"The governor said both New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights will investigate the alleged hate crime.\"New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon,\" Cuomo said. 'Heil Trump' painted on churchOn Sunday morning, the Rev. Kelsey Hutto got the news that vandals had painted \"Heil Trump,\" an anti-gay slur and a swastika on the side of her church, Saint David's Episcopal in Beanblossom, Indiana.She told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Thursday that she was at first sad, but believes that the church was targeted because it has always been inclusive to everyone. So, she said, she is taking comfort that whoever did this actually did this for the right reason, because the church has always been welcoming to everyone.\"Doing the right thing is not always the popular thing.\"In that spirit, the church has decided to leave the graffiti as is until November 30. \"If we decide to look at these and be embarrassed, and consider them hateful and angry, and decide to cover them up, then we give power to the idea that hate is more powerful than love,\" Hutto said. \"And that's not the case.\"The Brown County Sheriff's Department tells CNN it is investigating the incident. Investigators don't currently have any suspects or leads, but they have shared their report with the state police department and are hoping someone in the community will come forward with information if they have it.Swastika, 'Trump' at New York campus Hours after Cuomo reported the Wellsville incident, the governor announced another alleged hate crime -- this one at the State University of New York College at Genese. Someone spray-painted a swastika and the word \"Trump\" on a dorm building.  \"It is unacceptable that this is the second investigation that we have had to announce in the last several hours,\" Cuomo said in a statement Saturday. \"To any New Yorker who is scared, I want you to know that we have your back, that we will keep you safe, and that protecting your rights is what America stands for.\"Muslim student threatened with lighterPolice in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were investigating reports a man approached a Muslim student and threatened to set her on fire with a lighter unless she removed her hijab.The suspect is described as 20 to 30, unkempt and intoxicated, according to the University of Michigan.The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the alleged attack is among a spate of anti-Muslim incidents reported since Trump won the election. \"Our nation's leaders, and particularly President-elect Donald Trump, need to speak out forcefully against the wave of anti-Muslim incidents sweeping the country after Tuesday's election,\" Executive Director Dawud Walid said.'Trump!' written on Muslim prayer room door in  New YorkAt New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, students discovered Trump's name written on the door to a prayer room for Muslims on Wednesday, school officials said.\"Our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America,\" the NYU Muslim Students Association said in a Facebook posting. School spokesman Kathleen Hamilton said the school has many immigrant students, with about 20% from abroad.\"It's a real melting pot here,\" she said. \"We all believe this very much, that the university is a place of free expression. It has to be safe to be so.\"New York police are investigating. Graffiti in high school: 'Trump,' 'Whites only,' 'White America'Minnesota high school student Moses Karngbaye said he was terrified to see racist graffiti scrawled inside a bathroom. Someone had written \"#Go back to Africa\" and \"Make America great again\" on a toilet paper dispenser at Maple Grove Senior High School. \"That's the first time I honestly felt like crying at school,\" Karngbaye told CNN affiliate WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. The bathroom door was also covered with graffiti, including \"Whites only,\" \"White America\" and \"Trump.\" Karngbaye sent photos of the graffiti to his mother, Denise Karngbaye, who told WCCO she takes the attack personally.\"I train my kids to respect everybody, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, their background,\" she said. Hate crime investigation at San Diego State University A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said. \"Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab,\" university President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement.The men grabbed the student's purse and backpack and removed her keys. After the student returned from calling the police, her car was gone. The suspects are still at large. Hirshman called the incident a hate crime. \"We condemn this hateful act and urge all members of our community to join us in condemning such hateful acts,\" he said. \"Hate crimes are destructive to the spirit of our campus, and we urge all members of our community to stand together in rejecting hate.\" Graffiti: Neither black lives nor black votes matterThe day after Trump's victory, someone painted racist messages referencing the election on a wall in Durham, North Carolina. \"Black lives don't matter and neither does your votes,\" the message said, according to CNN affiliate WNCN-TV in Goldsboro.On Thursday, crews came to paint over the graffiti. Phyllis Terry, whose family owns the JC's Kitchen restaurant next to the graffiti, told the affiliate she was heartened by the effort to cover up the message. \"I am amazed. I am really touched this morning that the community has rallied together,\" she said.Nazi-themed graffiti in Philadelphia Someone spray-painted the words \"Sieg Heil 2016\" and \"Trump\" -- with a swastika substituted for the T in Trump -- on a building's glass window on South Broad Street, police said.The words \"Trump Rules,\" \"Trump Rules Black (expletive])\" and the letter \"T\" were spray-painted on three vehicles and a house on South Sixth Street. And a swastika and \"Trump\" were written on a utility box at Broad and Reed streets.Police said surveillance video captured a male of unknown race spray-painting around 5 a.m. Wednesday.It was unclear if the graffiti were a protest of Trump or a pro-Nazi act. But the Anti-Defamation League has denounced it.\"Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community,\" the ADL's regional director, Nancy K. Baron-Baer, said in a statement. Baron-Baer said the group views the graffiti as an isolated incident, but stressed that \"we cannot allow this behavior to become routine.\" Black doll hung from rod at collegeAt Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about \"Trump fans,\" college President John J. Hurley said.Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said.Some students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said. An outside investigator will be hired to determine if any students should be prosecuted for possible hate crimes, as several parents and students urged, Hurley said. He did not name the students or say how many were involved, citing privacy concerns.On Wednesday, the school held an open session on the doll incident attended by about 300 people. \"It is clear to me that this episode has exposed some deeply held concerns among our students of color and that we need to go well beyond addressing the immediate incident involving the doll,\" Hurley said.'Deportation' letters handed out at schoolA student at Shasta High School in Redding, California, posted a video on Twitter of himself handing  letters with the word \"deportation\" written across the top to half a dozen students, school district Superintendent Jim Cloney said in a statement.The students appeared to be of a variety of ethnicities, Cloney said. After talking to the student and his parents, the video was taken down. The student said he thought the video was funny, Cloney said.\"Needless to say, we don't think this sort of behavior is funny nor reflective of the culture of Shasta High,\" he said. He said appropriate discipline will be applied.TRUMP SUPPORTERS REPORT VIOLENCETrump supporter beaten in Maryland, police sayA young Trump supporter was beaten Wednesday by students during an anti-Trump protest in Rockville, Maryland, police said.Police Maj. Eric Over said a juvenile has been charged with a misdemeanor in connection with the assault. He could face additional charges. Police are reviewing a video of the incident. Over said the protest was largely peaceful.A witness, Kathy Silverstein, told CNN the young man who supported Trump came upon the protest and exchanged words with some demonstrators before the alleged assault occurred.   Hat-wearing supporter: I was assaulted on subway Corey Cataldo was riding a subway car to the Bronx when a man asked him whether he was a Trump supporter, police spokeswoman Sgt. Jessica McRorie said. When Cataldo said yes, the man grabbed him by the neck, hurting his left shoulder, McRorie said.Cataldo, 24, was wearing a white hat with the motto \"Make America Great Again\" stitched on it, CNN affiliate WABC-TV reported.  The electrician told WABC that as he was being chocked another man acted like he was going to help, but shoved him against a window.McRorie said no one has been arrested and the investigation into the reported incident continues. CNN called a number listed for Cataldo and left a message seeking comment. Men charged in beating of Trump supporter in ConnecticutTwo men were arrested in the punching and kicking of a Connecticut man who was waving an American flag and holding a Trump sign on November 12, Meriden police said. Wilson Eschevarria and Anthony Hobdy were charged with assault.The 45-year-old victim told police that Eschevarria and Hobdy gave him the finger and he responded, \"Same to you.\" That's when the two suspects started beating him, the man told police.  Man beaten as onlooker yells, 'You voted Trump!'David Wilcox said he was struck by another vehicle while driving in a Chicago intersection. When he got out to try to get insurance information, men from the other car started attacking him. \"You voted Trump!\" a bystander screamed as a man punched Wilcox in the head. Another tried to kick him in the face. Wilcox said he doesn't think his attackers knew who he voted for. Still, the assumption was already made. Even though he was beaten on the street in broad daylight, Wilcox said, \"Nobody did anything to help.\" On top of that, someone stole Wilcox's car. Police are investigating. FROM VIOLENCE TO UNITYBaylor University: 300 students escort victim to classAmid all the physical and verbal attacks, hundreds of Baylor University students rallied behind Natasha Nkhama to make sure she felt safe leaving class. Nkhama said she was walking to class last week when a guy \"went out of his way to bump into me and shove me off the sidewalk.\"\"He said, 'No n------ allowed on the sidewalk,'\" Nkhama said in a video posted to Twitter last Wednesday. \"I was just shocked, like I had no words.\"Nkhama said two men she did not know defended her, asking the student what he was doing.\"The guy said, 'Dude, like what, I'm just trying to make America great again,'\" Nkhama said.The university said it was \"aware of a student who was pushed and subjected to racially offensive language,\" an incident it describes as \"deeply disturbing and does not in any way reflect Baylor's faith or values.\"Nkhama's video and #IWalkWithNatasha quickly spread across social media. When Nkhama walked out of a class Friday, about 300 students stood by the door, waiting to walk her to her next class, according to campus police.  Nkhama broke down in tears.  \"I just wanted to thank everyone for being here, and I want everyone who sees this to know that Baylor is a campus of love,\" Nkhama said. She also thanked the two students who came to her defense when she was assaulted.  \"To whoever defended me that day, I don't know who you are, but I thank you honestly and thank you for being an example to everyone on campus.\"WHAT THE TEACHER SAID'Back to Africa' comment in FloridaA faculty member at a Pasco County, Florida, high school has been accused of telling a group of African-American students standing in a hallway, \"Don't make me call Donald Trump to get you sent back to Africa.\"The Wesley Chapel High School teacher, who is also the golf coach, allegedly made the remark the day after Trump was elected.The school system is investigating. \"As soon as the students reported the incident to administrators at the school on Wednesday, November 9, (the teacher) was sent home on administrative leave, where he remains,\" Pasco County Schools spokeswoman Linda E.

{"_id":"'Manchester by the Sea' sails along as melancholy gem","articleText":" (CNN)Kenneth Lonergan has earned a reputation for finely drawn character studies, and the writer-director outdoes himself with \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Featuring Casey Affleck in an Oscar-caliber performance, it's a deeply affecting little gem of a film, which should gently sweep filmgoers up in its melancholy tides.This is a movie where knowing too much going in will only blunt the experience. So suffice it to say that Affleck's character, Lee Chandler, is sleepwalking his way through life as a custodian/handyman when we meet him, living on the outskirts of Boston.His brother (Kyle Chandler), who had long suffered from heart disease, dies, forcing Lee to return to Manchester to see to his affairs. That also raises questions about what's going to happen to Lee's teenage nephew, Patrick (\"Moonrise Kingdom's\" Lucas Hedges, in an impressive performance), a popular kid with no desire to be uprooted from a life filled with hockey practice, girlfriends and trips aboard dad's fishing boat.Patrick's mother (Gretchen Mol) isn't in the picture, one of the subplots that Lonergan (\"You Can Count on Me\") gradually peels away through a series of flashbacks. And while the playwright-turned-director goes about setting up a major dilemma for Lee -- who has good reasons for not wanting to go home again -- he manages to plumb painful emotional threads while peppering the script with disarming humor.Unlike so many conventional movies, \"Manchester\" (which is being released by Amazon Studios) doesn't rush its story or force sudden epiphanies on its characters. The story rather feels organic and believable from start to finish.Affleck has been a lot more than just Ben's younger brother for some time, including a supporting Oscar nod for \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\" Nevertheless, this project (whose producers include Matt Damon) represents a step up in class that should put him in the thick of awards contention, even if his character says more with pained stares and random punches than he ever does with words.The rest of the cast -- which also includes Michelle Williams and Matthew Broderick -- is uniformly strong, and Lonergan (directing his third film) conjures a strong sense of place in the seaside community -- one where people live and die, but relatively few actually leave.Tonally, this is an art-house offering, pure and simple -- just one so artfully told that, like this year's \"Moonlight,\" it could have opportunities to cast its net a bit wider than those narrow quadrants.Amazon is still finding its way in entertainment, but the company has clearly put a considerable premium on prestige, both in its TV series and movies. If wading knee-deep into the movie awards season is intended to further burnish its credentials, then \"Manchester by the Sea\" delivers.\"Manchester by the Sea\" opens November 18. It's rated R.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/entertainment/manchester-by-the-sea-review/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Moana' is Disney's latest animated feast for the eyes and ears","articleText":" (CNN)Disney continues its animation roll with \"Moana,\" a seafaring quest that sails past its one rocky patch with visual brilliance and several Broadway-ready songs, the latter conjured in part by \"Hamilton's\" Lin-Manuel Miranda.Adding to the studio's stable of multicultural princesses (although the title character points out she's merely the daughter of a chief), the movie begins and ends strongly, which should compensate for a flat stretch in the middle that, not coincidentally, is right around the time when the demigod known as Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, shows up.People magazine's newly anointed Sexiest Man Alive might be a great marketing hook (and he even sings), but Maui's arrival shifts the movie onto a different track -- from a young girl's emotional coming-of-age story to something more broad and jokey. While there's obvious calculation in that -- hey, let's be sure to appeal to boys as well as girls -- it temporarily knocks the movie off course, before \"Moana\" regains the wind at its back as it cruises to the finish.Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho) grows up in an idyllic Polynesian island paradise, where the only rule laid down by her father is not to venture beyond the reef. But his daughter yearns to explore, which she announces in a song titled \"How Far I'll Go\" (not to be confused with \"Frozen's\" \"Let It Go\"), the kind of show-stopping anthem that, with Cravalho's soaring belt, would bring a legit theater crowd to its feet.As it turns out, Moana has a good reason to get out and see the world, and not just because her sage old grandma urges her to do so. That's because the aforementioned Maui stole the heart of the island goddess Te Fiti, and the island her people call home will essentially shrivel and die if Moana can't locate Maui and convince him to join her on a perilous journey that will involve, among other things, facing off against a giant lava monster.The ornate mythology of it all -- in a film directed by the teams behind \"The Princess and the Frog\" and \"Big Hero Six,\" and that credits its story to seven writers -- risks becoming a trifle overwhelming exposition-wise. There's also a certain rote quality to the impediments thrown at Moana and Maui as they traverse the ocean bickering, as much killing time before the climax as allowing the two to bond.What makes it work, ultimately, is an intoxicating blend of music and sweeping, luminous vistas. Infused with magic throughout, even the ocean serves as a key character, while Moana blossoms into about as brave and plucky a heroine as any Disney has produced.As a bonus, \"Moana\" is also paired with one of Disney's best recent shorts, \"Inner Workings,\" which chronicles the age-old battle between our hearts and our heads with remarkably efficiency. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of the studio.)Disney's marketing for the movie promotes its \"Frozen\" lineage, although catching the sort of massive wave that blockbuster rode three years ago seems unlikely.Overall, though, this is a wholly satisfying family movie, released at a time when people are probably hungry for one. So even if \"Moana\" is occasionally guilty of treading water, Disney's latest animated voyage goes far enough as a feast for the eyes and ears to give fans plenty for which to be thankful.\"Moana\" opens November 23 in the U.S. It's rated PG.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/entertainment/moana-review/index.html"}

In particular, \"Moonlight\" director Barry Jenkins told a crowd this weekend at AFI Fest in Los Angeles that his movie experienced a major increase at the box office in the days following the election. \"Wednesday morning, this film, on the same amount of screens it was on Tuesday, went up like 40% because people felt this film was a place they could go to assuage or address whatever it was they are feeling in response to Tuesday,\" Jenkins told the crowd at a conversation about the movie held at The Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. \"I couldn't have anticipated that.\" RELATED: Reports of racist graffiti, hate crimes post-election\"Moonlight\" is a coming-of-age tale that follows three distinct periods in the life of character named Chiron, played by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes.The film, among many things, has been praised for its portrayal of Chiron's struggle with his sexuality and the way it tackles the issue of black masculinity. The movie is among the films thought to be a frontrunner for the upcoming Academy Awards. On Wednesday, \"Moonlight\" grossed $108,142, up 37.3% from the previous day, according to figures from Box Office Mojo. Its upward trend continued in the following days. On Friday, the film expanded from 83 theaters to 176 and saw a 230% increase in its gross. \"It's a really beautiful feeling to have created something that -- for whatever people were feeling this week -- they can come to this film as a place to call home for even 110 minutes,\" Jenkins added. \"In that respect, it's been amazing.\" Jenkins was joined on the panel by Rhodes and Mahershala Ali.

{"_id":"'No differences' between children of same-sex and opposite-sex parents ","articleText":" (CNN)A new study in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics finds that the kids really are all right. Despite the ongoing cultural debate around same-sex parenting, the new study finds the children of same-sex parents are just as healthy emotionally and physically as the children of different-sex parents. An apples to apples comparisonDr. Nanette Gartrell, one of the study's authors, said the aim was to do a real population-based, apples to apples comparison. \"It is the only study to compare same-sex and different-sex parent households with stable, continuously coupled parents and their biological offspring,\" said Gartrell. This study tried to compensate for the shortcomings of previous studies, which recruited same-sex parent families and could thus establish a certain selection bias. \"It's been a goal of ours to do a nationally representative survey in which we could do this very carefully matched study,\" she said Using the National Survey of Children's Health on emotional and physical well being, Gartrell and her colleagues matched 95 same-sex female parent households to 95 different-sex parent based on the following characteristics: Parents' ageParents' level of education Whether parents were born in the United StatesFamily residence (urban or rural)Child's ageChild's raceChild's gender Whether the child was born in the United States or elsewhereNo differences in children's outcomesThe study found that there were no differences in the children when it came to their general health, their emotional difficulties, their coping behaviors and their learning behaviors. What the study found to be more indicative predictors of these behaviors were the relationships between the parents, the parents and child, and parenting stress. The study did note that lesbian parents seem to exhibit higher levels of parenting stress, which Gartell attributed to perceived homophobia. \"Parents feel pressured to justify the quality of their parenting more than their heterosexual counterparts. We also suspect and feel that more study is warranted, but the cultural spotlight on same-sex parenting may be part of the stress,\" she said. Those against same-sex parenting have pointed to studies that have found gay parents to have a negative impact on childhood outcomes, such as lower levels of income, and poorer mental and physical healthGartell said studies like those didn't compensate for the fact that they were comparing children from same-sex couples who were not continuously coupled. Rather, those studies looked at children from same-sex families who experienced family upheaval such as divorce, adoption or foster care and compared them to children from stable households with different-sex parents. The current study only looked at lesbian households, because when households were finally matched and controlled for continuous relationships, there were too few male same-sex households. Gartrell said this is by no means the final study to be done on same-sex parenting. \"We still have so much to learn and find out about different types of families,\" she said.

{"_id":"'Nocturnal Animals' brings dark twists to multi-tiered tale","articleText":" (CNN)From its provocative opening images, \"Nocturnal Animals\" feels as much about tone and mood as story -- perhaps no surprise, given that it's the second film from designer turned writer-director Tom Ford. While the movie sustains interest by weaving together familiar elements in an enticing way, the noir-ish journey proves more satisfying than the payoff.Ford has ambitiously structured the film on three overlapping planes, centering on Susan (Amy Adams), a wealthy art-gallery owner, whose outwardly glamorous life obscures a terribly unhappy and loveless marriage.With her philandering husband (Armie Hammer) away on a trip, she receives galleys for an upcoming book from her first husband, which bears a dedication to her. Titled \"Nocturnal Animals,\" she dives into reading it, triggering flashbacks about the choices she made, and regrets she harbors over the end of that relationship.Susan's ex, Edward, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who performs double duty by also starring in the third thread -- the book's fictional yarn about a motorist, his family and a tragic encounter on the highway. That unfolding story -- grim and brutal as it is -- obviously informs the flashbacks, to the extent that Edward has tipped off that the novel has been vaguely inspired by the couple's past.To Ford's credit, the fictional subplot -- set in a dusty and desolate part of Texas -- feels the most vibrant and compelling, causing one to forget that this is a work of fiction within a movie. It's also extremely well cast, with Michael Shannon as a gruff sheriff and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the leader of the trio that Edward's character has the misfortune to meet.At the same time, Susan's narrowly drawn lot proves relatively weak, leaving Adams little to do but emit heavy sighs and longing gazes as she burrows into the manuscript and battles insomnia, rekindling long-dormant feelings and reopening old wounds.It's tempting but too dismissive to say Ford (whose first film was 2009's \"A Single Man\") exalts style over substance. He's clearly more than a dabbler in moviemaking, bringing both considerable tension and wit to this story, especially when his rich creative types dash off amusing lines like, \"Having a gay husband is not such a bad thing.\"Yet while \"Nocturnal Animals\" keeps the audience on edge, it doesn't possess much of a lingering kick. Given that Ford seems intent on contemplating what we truly value, that dynamic adds up to a movie that's worth seeing, but also one lacking the kind of depth that's worth losing sleep over.\"Nocturnal Animals\" opens in select U.S. cities on November 18 and nationwide on December 9. It's rated R.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/entertainment/nocturnal-animals-review/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Provocative' statue of Netanyahu appears overnight, then knocked over","articleText":"Jerusalem (CNN)A surprising sight greeted people walking though Tel Aviv's Rabin Square on Tuesday morning. A statue of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been erected on top of a white plinth. The gilded statue, dubbed \"King Bibi\" by its creator, stood more than 4 meters high with a red rope barrier around it to enhance the effect. The man responsible was Israeli sculptor Itay Zalait. He told Israeli television he had placed it in the square during the night because he wanted to make people think. Art, Zalait said, is supposed to be provocative. However, the municipal council didn't see it that way and gave him a ticket and a fine.Culture Minister Miri Regev, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, was also unimpressed. A spokesperson told CNN Regev described the statue as a \"Golden calf motivated by hate\" for the Prime Minister. Speaking to Israeli radio, opposition leader Isaac Herzog called it a \"legitimate protest.\" Word quickly spread and for a short while the statue became a minor tourist attraction until the inevitable happened. A man in the crowd decided he had enough and with one shove the statue of the Prime Minister was sent crashing back to Earth.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-gold-statue/index.html"}
{"_id":"'San Antonio Four' exonerated in child rape case","articleText":" (CNN)They spent nearly 15 years in prison for a crime so unspeakable they simply became known as the \"San Antonio Four.\"Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh, Cassandra Rivera and Anna Vasquez were convicted in the late 1990s of gang-raping two little girls who were Ramirez's nieces.They had recently come out as lesbians and prosecutors used their sexuality as a motive. The women refused plea deals and took the rare step of testifying in their defense to say they had done no wrong. After years of fighting to clear their names, the state's highest court exonerated them on Wednesday, saying they had achieved the \"Herculean\" task of proving their innocence. The ruling overturns their convictions, prevents further prosecutions and paves the way for the women to potentially seek millions of dollars in compensation from the state.\"Those defendants have won the right to proclaim to the citizens of Texas that they did not commit a crime. That they are innocent. That they deserve to be exonerated,\" Texas Court of Appeals Judge David Newell wrote in the majority opinion. \"These women have carried that burden. They are innocent. And they are exonerated.\"The Bexar County District Attorney's Office, which prosecuted the case, welcomed the decision.\"It has been a long legal process for these women and our office has worked with the defense to ensure justice was done in this case. With today's announcement we believe the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' decision did that,\" District Attorney Nico LaHood said in a statement. \"I pray [for] peace and a new beginning for them.\"An attack on their sexualityThe allegations in 1994 rocked San Antonio and made national headlines, becoming the subject of the documentary \"Southwest of Salem.\" In an era when more gays and lesbians were coming out and mainstreaming, many saw the allegations as an indictment of the women's sexuality, especially as the case against them began to unravel.\"I think the only reason that the investigation was seriously pursued, why there wasn't more skepticism about the preposterous allegations in the first place, was because these four women had recently come out as gay, that they were openly gay,\" attorney Mike Ware told CNN's Jean Casarez in April.The case stemmed from allegations from Ramirez's nieces, ages 7 and 9. They stayed with their aunt for a few days in the summer of 1994 while their mother was on vacation. During their stay, Mayhugh, Vasquez and Rivera visited Ramirez's apartment at various points.When they returned home they told their grandmother the women pinned them down and sexually assaulted them on two occasions. Their accounts varied in subsequent statements to police and the examining doctor and in trial testimony on several points, from the weapon used to subdue them to when the incidents took place, the Supreme Court opinion noted. Such inconsistencies were \"easy to set aside,\" Newell wrote, given testimony from the state's medical expert. Dr. Nancy Kellogg that said the girls had vaginal injuries that could only come from \"painful trauma\" caused by penetration with a foreign object.Bexar County prosecutors portrayed Ramirez as the ringleader and tried her first. She was convicted in 1997 of aggravated sexual assault of a child and indecency with a child, despite her testimony that she had no idea \"how they could even think of me doing something like that.\" She was sentenced to 37.5 years in prison.The remaining women were tried together in 1998 and were each convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child and two counts of indecency with a child. All three were sentenced to 15 years in prison on the aggravated sexual assault charges and 10 years for the indecency charges.The cases unravelThe convictions began to unravel several years ago when one of Ramirez's two nieces, now in her twenties, stepped forward to say she had lied.Members of her family coached her, she told authorities, to make up a story because of their anger toward Ramirez's sexuality. Her father in particular coerced them so he could gain leverage in a custody battle, she said.Soon after, Kellogg recanted her testimony based on new science that showed her findings regarding the girls' injuries were medically inaccurate. With the new evidence, Ware and the Innocence Project of Texas filed for post-conviction relief to have the verdicts overturned.A story 'no rational juror' would believeA Bexar County District Court allowed Mayhugh, Rivera and Ramirez to be released from prison in 2013 while the court considered their request. Vasquez had just been released on parole. The motion worked its way through the Texas courts. After a two-day hearing during which the niece and the doctor retracted their initial claims, a judge recommended in February 2016 that the convictions be vacated. But it declined to fully exonerate them without a full recantation from the second niece.The Court of Appeals sided with the lower court's ruling that \"more likely than not,\" the jury would not have convicted the women had they heard about the new scientific evidence. It also relied heavily on the niece who came forward, saying that her recantation coupled with the lack of reliable forensic evidence would lead \"no rational juror\" to find any of the defendants guilty.The Innocence Project of Texas celebrated the news in a Facebook post that includes a recent picture of the women and their lawyer.\"Plenty to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season, including the full exoneration of Anna Vasquez, Elizabeth Ramirez, Cassandra Rivera, and Kristie Mayhugh, also known as the San Antonio 4!\"CNN's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/us/san-antonio-four-exonerated/index.html"}

{"_id":"'This is not the New Orleans way,' mayor says of deadly shootout","articleText":" (CNN)Gunshots interrupted a weekend of holiday celebrations in New Orleans' French Quarter early Sunday, leaving one person dead and nine injured, city officials said.An argument between two men on Bourbon Street escalated into a shootout, police Chief Michael Harrison said at a news conference Sunday. Authorities are searching for the two men, who are believed to be from outside of New Orleans.\"We believe they ran into each other in the street, and an argument ensued at that time, that stemmed from an argument that they had already from another place,\" Harrison said. Two women and eight men between the ages of 20 and 37 were shot, the chief said. Five have been released from hospitals and the four who remain hospitalized are expected to make a full recovery, Harrison said. \"We don't believe any of those shot were the intended targets,\" Harrison said. The deceased was identified as 25-year-old Demontris Toliver of Lafayette, Louisiana, a man with a \"promising life,\" Mayor Mitch Landrieu said Sunday.  The shooting took place during Bayou Classic Weekend, four days of festivities that include a Thanksgiving parade, a Saturday college football game between Grambling State and Southern University and a Saints game on Sunday. The popular tourist area was more crowded than usual when the shooting happened because the college game had ended some six hours earlier in the nearby Superdome. \"Until the middle of last night it was a glorious vacation and wonderful holiday by all measures,\" Landrieu said. \"This is not the New Orleans way.\" 'Those people made a choice to endanger lives'Police received a call just before 1:30 a.m. reporting shots at the intersection of Bourbon and Iberville streets, near the western edge of the French Quarter. About 40 police stationed in the neighborhood for Bayou Classic special events responded to the call on foot and horseback, Harrison said. The shooting appears to have stemmed from an argument between the two men that started elsewhere, Harrison said without elaborating. When they encountered each other again on Bourbon Street the dispute turned into a shootout, after which the suspects fled the scene.Police have \"strong information\"  leading to the suspects' identities, Harrison said without providing names. \"This is an active, fast-moving investigation,\" he said. \"We will pursue every lead.\"Police arrested two men at the scene for illegally carrying weapons, one of whom was a victim of the shooting, Harrison said. They were among 11 people arrested over the weekend for illegally carrying firearms, in what Harrison described as a sign that despite the shooting, police were otherwise vigilant and prepared.\"Everything we could do we did,\" he said. \"Those people made a choice to endanger lives.\"CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

{"_id":"'Thunderstorm asthma:' Deadly illness caused by freak weather","articleText":" (CNN)An unusual combination of weather conditions leading to a freak illness known as thunderstorm asthma has left four people dead in Australia.Thousands of people were rushed to hospital Monday with breathing problems in the southern Australian state of Victoria as emergency services struggled to cope. Three were still in a critical condition Thursday, a Victorian Department of Health spokesman told CNN.During a four hour period Monday, Ambulance Victoria received more than 1,900 calls, or one call every four to five seconds. An extra 60 ambulances were deployed, as well as police and firefighters.Freak incidentThunderstorm asthma occurs when a storm hits during a period of unusually high rye grass pollen, said Robin Ould, chief executive of the Asthma Foundation of Australia. \"When you have a perfect storm coming together (of) a very high pollen day, high humidity, and a thunderstorm, the grains of rye grass absorb water with the humidity and they break up into thousands of pieces,\" Ould said.\"Normally with rye grass the pollen would be trapped by nose hairs. When it breaks up it goes straight to the lungs.\"The pollen irritates the lungs' bronchial tubes, causing them to become inflamed and filled with mucus and making it hard for people to breathe. Pollen levels peak in late spring. When this combines with strong winds, rain and high temperatures, as it did in Victoria this week, it can lead to incidents of thunderstorm asthma. Though grass pollen is the most common known cause of thunderstorm asthma, attacks can also be triggered by excessive levels of tree pollen and fungal spores in the atmosphere. \"This will vary by geography,\" said Aziz Sheikh, Professor of Primary Care Research and Development at the University of Edinburgh, adding that pollen from olive trees, for example, was reported in a previous thunderstorm asthma event in Italy in 2010.Levels of fungal spores in the atmosphere typically peak during harvest, which can also be drawn up and broken down during large thunderstorms due to the rise in atmospheric pressure, according to Sheikh.Edward Newbigin, a professor of biosciences at the University of Melbourne, said that many of those affected in Australia this week may never have had an asthma attack before. \"I imagine it was absolutely terrifying,\" he said. Of more than 2,500 people surveyed by the university, 74% said they experienced asthma during the storm. Of those, 32% had never experienced an asthma attack before. 'Absolute shock'One of the dead, 18-year-old Omar Moujalled, had just finished his final year of studies at Melbourne's Australian International Academy. His friend Shuayb Talic told CNN the news left him in \"absolute shock, denial, then horror.\" \"Omar was the fittest of the group,\" Talic said. \"We were discussing a gym meet up just a few days earlier. However, he did have asthma, and apparently it was so severe during the storm he could barely stand up to treat it.\" Apollo Papadopoulos, 35, and Hope Carnevali, 20, also died during the storm. Carnevali passed away in the arms of her family members after waiting more than 40 minutes for an ambulance, according to CNN affiliate 7 News Australia.The fourth victim was father-of-two Clarence Leo, 7 News Australia said, who died after an asthma attack early on Tuesday morning.Rare illnessThunderstorm asthma last struck Victoria in May 2010, having previously \"had several reports,\" according to Sheikh.But the condition is not limited to Australia. Experts say incidents of thunderstorm asthma have been seen in the UK, US, Italy and Canada, but the condition is \"very under reported,\" said Newbigin. Sheikh pointed out, however, that \"English-speaking countries are also countries with the highest prevalence of asthma.\"People with hay fever are particularly at risk, Newbigin said. He advised them to \"better manage your hay fever during the pollen season,\" by using antihistamines, eye drops and other medications. Though normally hay fever occurs in the nasal area, the freak weather conditions which cause thunderstorm asthma can drive the allergens deep into the lungs, causing a far more severe asthmatic attack. \"Anybody with severe or brittle asthma (a less common form involving severe but irregular attacks) is most likely to experience severe symptoms and need rapid treatment,\" said Sheikh, adding that smog days, pollution and smoking as other environmental triggers for an attack. \"They are much less likely to trigger it if there is good underlying asthma control.\"CNN's Pedram Javaheri and Meera Senthilingam contributed reporting.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/thunderstorm-asthma-australia/index.html"}
{"_id":"'Trump Effect' hits Europe with mixed results","articleText":"Washington (CNN)After President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory, far-right politicians in Europe crowed that it marked the beginning of a \"destined\" new world order that would soon see them rise to power too.Destiny took a slight detour this weekend, however. Austria's pro-European Green Party surprised observers and even the party's own supporters in defeating the Freedom Party, founded by former Nazis, in presidential elections Sunday. Instead, the so-called \"Trump effect\" struck in Italy, where anti-establishment voters rejected constitutional reforms, triggering Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's resignation. The votes captured how polarized Europeans are by many of the same issues that propelled Trump to victory, including immigration, trade and economic malaise. Frustration over EU regulations also play a role as voters gravitate toward anti-establishment, anti-elite parties.Austria might have demonstrated that the Trump Effect has limits, but both votes reflect complicated political currents and coming challenges that strike at the heart of Europe itself. Following Britain's unexpected June vote to leave the European Union, there's now the possibility of snap elections in Italy. And national elections are slated for France, Germany and the Netherlands in 2017. \"I don't think the wave of populism, the tide sweeping across the Atlantic, has been stopped by any means,\" said Alina Polyakova, a deputy director at the German Marshall Fund, referring to the Austrian results. \"The idea of an Austrian Freedom Party candidate getting so close to leading the country was pretty much unfathomable a few years ago. Trump himself has repeatedly criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel over immigration, an issue that could hurt her at the polls, saying that because of her openness to taking Syrian refugees fleeing the war she \"ruined Germany.\" Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front party who wants to end all immigration to France, told the BBC in November that Trump's win was an \"additional stone in the building of a new world order destined to replace the old one.\" The larger picture, says Mathew Burrows, director of the Strategic Foresight Initiative at the Atlantic Council, is of uncertainty for Europe itself as well as for its ties to the US.\"It's an inflection point,\" Burrows said. \"I think this is really a breakup of the EU, not that the EU itself is going to go completely away, but it's the end of that vision that started at the end of the Second World War that Europe was going to unite.\" Green Party surprise in AustriaThe Austrian vote, on the surface, seems to be an embrace of Europe. The Green candidate, 72-year-old Alexander Van der Bellen, won with just over 53% of the vote without a robust campaigning structure, but with a clear pro-Europe stance.Even so, a vote for Van see Bellen didn't represent a vote for the status quo. Voter anger meant that neither candidate representing the two mainstream parties made it into the second round of voting, according to the Eurasia Group. That meant that voters who didn't want a far-right candidate only had the choice of an independent with past ties to Austrian communists.The Freedom Party hadn't explicitly argued for leaving the EU, but was harshly critical of the bloc and won the backing of those that want its dissolution, including Le Pen's National Front and Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party. In an echo of Trump's campaign, the Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer used the slogan \"Austria First\" and he echoed the anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic rhetoric that animated many of Trump's speeches as well as rightist and conservative parties across Europe. Rosa Balfour, acting director of the Europe Program at the German Marshall Fund, said Austrians were reacting in part to the shock they saw in Britain after the so-called \"Brexit\" vote and in part as a counter-reaction to Trump.\"When Trump won, certainly it made populist leaders feel very empowered, but it's had a counter-effect,\" Balfour said from Brussels. \"Citizens may feel frightened and aware that they can provoke extreme changes when all they wanted to do was protest against a particular government or figure.\" Voters in Italy, Austria send message to EU leaders: Hold on tightAfter Hofer's loss, Iowa's Republican Rep. Steve King, who has referred to \"sub-groups\" to whites, tweeted a photo of the two of them and his condolences on the loss. \"The cause of freedom & our friendship remain. Onward!\" he wrote.Yet Charles Lichtfield, an associate with the Eurasia Group, points to the fact that 46% of Austrian voters cast a vote for the Freedom Party.\"We should not assume that this eliminates the threat posed by a popular far right in Austria, or indeed elsewhere in the EU,\" he wrote in an analysis. Polling suggests that in the next election, the Freedom Party is likely to come first, he said, and form a coalition government.Vote against RenziPolyakova and others said the Italian vote, widely read as another sign of the populist wave, is more complicated than that. In a move reminiscent of the way British Prime Minister David Cameron staked his position of the outcome of the Brexit referendum, Renzi said he'd step down if his push for constitutional reforms failed. The coalition that assembled against him included anti-establishment groups such as the populist Euro-skeptic Five Star Movement. But it also included pro-Europeans, Balfour pointed out, and was about much more than anger about the Italian status quo.The constitutional changes Renzi had suggested would give the executive branch of government more power than it had ever had and curtailed the Senate's legislative abilities, and were hotly debated publicly and on TV, she said.\"Alongside the protest vote, the Euroskeptic vote, there was also a vote on the merits of the reforms, and then a generic vote against the prime minister, not necessarily out of populism, but simply\" because some people didn't like Renzi and \"he framed the whole referendum as a vote for or against him,\" Balfour said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/austria-italy-trump/index.html"}

Luckily, he survived.\"Everything is fine with the child, we will visit him very soon,\" Wadah Seddikh, the charity's economic director, told CNN via email.A separate chemical attack that killed a couple and their four children was reported on Sunday by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights and the Aleppo Media Center activist group, as a barrage of barrel bombs struck the al-Sakhour neighborhood.CNN cannot independently verify the details of the video and chemical attacks as its access to eastern Aleppo is heavily restricted.UN found chemical weapon useBoth sides of Syria's civil war have accused one another of using chemical weapons in the past.Syrian regime forces resumed heavy bombardment over eastern Aleppo on Tuesday last week after a three-week pause, killing more than 300 people by Monday, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer rescue group also known as the White Helmets.A UN investigation in late August found that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, both by the national air force and ISIS militants. It found two instances where regime forces had used chlorine as a chemical weapon, and one where ISIS had used mustard gas between 2014 and 2015.Barrel bombs are usually dropped by the government or Russia, which has carried out airstrikes over Syria since September 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad's regime.A sarin gas attack in August 2013 widely blamed on the Syrian regime left more than 1,300 people dead, according to US officials.CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/middleeast/aleppo-boy-chemical-attack/index.html"}

{"_id":"1 Undershaft: Green light for London's latest record-breaking skyscraper","articleText":" (CNN)Some commentators think Brexit will clamp the brakes on growth in the UK. London's skyline clearly didn't get the memo. Plans for 1 Undershaft, set to become the City of London's tallest skyscraper, have been formally approved, paving the way for construction of the 1,016 feet high tower.Dubbed \"The Trellis,\" 1 Undershaft will rise to the same height as The Shard -- the tallest building in European Union -- due to its slightly elevated platform north of the River Thames. Containing 1.4 million square feet of office space across 73 floors, it will also have restaurants, retail space and an education center in collaboration with the Museum of London. And, unlike The Shard, 1 Undershaft will have a free public viewing gallery at its peak -- the UK's tallest.From the top the public will have views down on the City, including 30 St Mary Axe, otherwise known as \"The Gherkin\" and the 122 Leadenhall Street, aka \"The Cheesegrater.\" 1 Undershaft will tower above 122 Leadenhall Street, at present the tallest building in the city, by a substantial 280 feet.The tower, anticipated to open in the next decade, was designed by Eric Parry and commissioned by Singapore-based Aroland Holdings Limited as part of the company's plan to develop tall buildings in capitals around the world. While the City of London's Planning and Transport Committee has approved a resolution to grant permission on 1 Undershaft, the design is still subject to a satisfactory Section 106 -- an agreement between developers and the local council on the building's wider impact on the area (i.e. public space or surrounding roads).Read: How to quakeproof a skyscraper\"We are delighted,\" says Parry. \"1 Undershaft represents the very best of British architecture and will set new standards for the City in terms of comfort, quality and environmental sustainability.\"The architect described the decision as \"a vote of confidence in the City of London,\" at a time when fears abound that a \"hard Brexit,\" in which Britain would leave the European single market, could threaten the viability of many operations within the City. Paris and German's financial hub Frankfurt have been mooted as alternative locations for European headquarters, but investment and a buoyant attitude from the likes of Aroland Holdings may have companies thinking twice before decamping to La Defense or elsewhere. Make room for the tech giantsUneasiness may be percolating through parts of the financial sector, but multiple tech giants are doubling down when it comes to real estate in the English capital.Earlier this month Google unveiled plans to build on its King's Cross campus, northwest of the City. The design, a collaboration between Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), is firmly under wraps, with only a vague exterior outline released by the internet giant. What is known is that the 650,000 square foot building will push the company's total office space to over one million square feet at the 67-acre site -- enough room for 7,000 so-called \"Googlers.\" The new headquarters -- the first wholly owned and designed by Google outside the US -- follows the release earlier this year of an updated design for the company's Mountain View site in California (also designed by Heatherwick and Ingels).Google CEO Sundar Pichai stressed that the company is \"committed to the UK,\" while London mayor Sadiq Khan described that commitment as \"very welcome,\" as well as \"demonstrating that London is open to business\" -- a familiar rallying cry of Khan's, post-referendum.Meanwhile Facebook last week announced a hiring spree, increasing the company's headcount in London by 50%, creating 500 new jobs ahead of a planned move to Fitzrovia in 2017. Onwards and upwards1 Undershaft will come as welcome relief for firms battling it out to secure prime office space in London -- on average $102 per square foot per annum according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank. It won't be alone, however. A report by New London Architecture in March 2016 listed proposals for 119 buildings 20 storeys or more in the previous 12 months, with 89 \"tall\" buildings under construction at the time.Time will tell how many proposals survive the post-referendum jitters. If the financial crisis of 2007 showed the architecture world anything, it was that new buildings are among the first investments to fall through. That being said, one planned skyscraper in the City that looks to be on track is 22 Bishopsgate. PLP Architecture's 912 feet tower will, for a time, be the tallest in the City. With an estimated completion date of 2019, it's safe to predict 22 Bishopsgate will have at least a few years in the sun, before being eclipsed by 1 Undershaft.","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/architecture/1-undershaft-london-upcoming-constructions/index.html"}
{"_id":"1 in 4 US children lacks proper health care, report says","articleText":" (CNN)More than a quarter of American children are not getting the health care they need, according to a new report from the nonprofit Children's Health Fund (PDF).Dr. Irwin Redlener, who co-authored the report, sat down with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday morning to reveal the details. He said he hopes it will convince Donald Trump and members of his administration to not repeal and replace Obamacare, as the President-elect has pledged to do.\"We still have about 20 million children in America, even with insurance, who are not getting the kind of health care that they need,\" said Redlener, who is president of the Children's Health Fund and a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University. \"That's really a big problem.

Many children are insured but live in places where they can't get to doctors. \"There are children who live in extreme shortage areas,\" Redlener said. \"They live in counties or communities where there's less than one doctor for every 3,000 people. They're living in communities where there is no affordable transportation to allow parents to take the kids to the doctor even if they want to.\"Redlener, who supported Hillary Clinton in this month's presidential election and was going to be part of her transition team, said the focus needs to be on getting doctors to underserved areas and fixing the transportation system, rather than on changing the insurance system. He told Cuomo that he is reaching out to Trump's administration and thinks it will be receptive.\"There's been a lot of talk about fixing our infrastructure,\" he said. \"Well, in some ways, children are human infrastructure. We need investments in children, at least as much as we need investment in our physical attributes.\"Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET.

{"_id":"10 requests from liberals to Obama before he leaves office ","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to undo President Barack Obama's legacy once he takes office on January 20, 2017. However, with just over a month left before Obama leaves the White House, liberals are putting in some last minute requests for the outgoing commander-in-chief. While many of Obama's critics have highlighted the use of executive orders as an overreach, many of his supporters on the left are urging him to use his final days in office to take action. Pardon Edward SnowdenVarious famous faces have publicly called on the President to pardon NSA leaker Edward Snowden, including actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Daniel Radcliffe, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and business magnate and political activist George Soros. Pardon 750,000 undocumented young peopleDemocratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez, Lucille Roybal-Allard and Zoe Lofgren urged Obama in a letter to pardon more than 750,000 undocumented young people known as \"Dreamers,\" and to not leave their fate in the hands of Trump. Close Guantanamo BayWhile presidential candidate Obama pledged to close the US detention camp, the prison is still open. The Close Guantanamo campaign has set up the \"Countdown to Close Guantanamo\" initiative to mark how many days the President has left to close the facility. Pardon Hillary ClintonCivil rights activist, the Rev. Jesse Jackson called on Obama to pardon the former Democratic presidential nominee before he leaves office in order to prevent Trump allies from attempting to prosecute her. Trump has ruled out investigating and prosecuting Clinton as president. Reduce or commute Chelsea Manning's prison sentence Manning, who disclosed secret diplomatic and military documents to Wikileaks, has asked the President to reduce her 35-year sentence. Formally recognize PalestineFormer President Jimmy Carter wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week that before Obama leaves office, he should formally recognize Palestinian statehood. End the violence at Standing Rock Musician Neil Young called on the President in a Facebook post to make sure authorities treat those protesting the North Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation with respect. Free asylum-seekers Immigration advocates have asked the President to release thousands of detained Central American women and children who are seeking asylum in the United States. Replace water pipes in Flint, MichiganLiberal Filmmaker Michael Moore called on the President to \"send the Army Corps of Engineers to Flint to replace the water pipes. Create more national monuments Environmentalist groups have urged the President to preserve more land as national monuments. Creating a national monument could prevent mining, drilling, or construction on designated lands.

{"_id":"10 things you didn't know about Las Vegas","articleText":"Las Vegas (CNN)Not many cities evoke as many instant associations as Las Vegas. Maybe you think of the Rat Pack, showgirls and mobsters sipping martinis. Or perhaps it's bachelorettes and bros on a bender that everyone hopes won't end up on Facebook. It's a town whose story has been told thousands of times, in books such as \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" movies such as \"Casino\" and television shows from \"Vega$\" to \"Vegas.\"But there's much more to the city than just sin. More than 600,000 people live here -- closer to 900,000 if you include the adjacent suburb of Henderson. Plenty of slots and cocktails still abound, but the arts and cultural scene is blossoming and a tech boom is building. There's a lot about Vegas you might not know -- and we don't just mean magic tricks, personal secrets or those holes in the desert you see in gangster movies.1. Down with the old, up with the newNo town turns over real estate like Las Vegas. The Wynn inhabits the site of the storied Desert Inn; the Bellagio has totally obliterated the Dunes. Planet Hollywood still has some of the Aladdin buried inside, while the Sahara was gutted and repurposed as the SLS. There's still a Flamingo, but Bugsy Siegel didn't run rampant there -- the final remnant of the original hotel was torn down in 1993. A small plaque in the garden indicates the location of Siegel's personal suite, which had bulletproof glass, earthquake-proof walls and a trapdoor in the closet leading to escape tunnels.2. City of cultureLas Vegas is a big museum town -- in its own way. We have the Neon Museum, a dazzling pile of obsolete signage, from vast casinos such as the Stardust and Moulin Rouge to roadside motel dice or the smiling shirt advertising a dry cleaner. At the Mob Museum, you can see Kefauver's courtroom, where mafiosos testified before senators, as well as the bullet-riddled brick wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The National Atomic Testing Museum has history, science and bombs. At the Pinball Hall of Fame, you can admire (and play) hundreds of games. Dream of driving the 1932 Rolls-Royce Phantom II at the Auto Collections or check out Gypsy Rose Lee's g-string at the Burlesque Hall of Fame.3. DowntownWhen people think of Vegas, they think of the Strip, but in recent years the older Downtown area has been pulling focus. Online retailer Zappos moved in, and CEO Tony Hsieh started the Downtown Project, aimed at revitalizing the neighborhood through investing in real estate and small businesses (and a huge music festival). A number of the older casinos have received facelifts, while new bars and restaurants open at an ever-accelerating rate. For entertainment, the Smith Center has high-end offerings -- ballet, Broadway shows.Conversely, the Fremont Street Experience offers classic rock-themed light shows, concerts of cover bands (or the occasional original artist) and plenty of frozen drinks in souvenir cups. Somewhere in between is the Inspire Theater's edgy variety shows and bar-with-a-view, as well as touring band venues like Beauty Bar and Backstage Bar & Billiards.4. Conventioneers!There are thousands of conventions in Vegas every year, with millions of attendees.There are the well-known ones such as CES (premiering the newest technology, from smartphones to spoons that post your calorie count on the Internet) and the AVN (the porn convention). We welcome the movie stars of CinemaCon and the messengers of Interbike, the Bar & Nightclub Expo and the National Hardware Show, the Renfaire fans and the Trekkies. Even if you're not here on business, be aware that a major gathering can affect hotel availability, restaurant reservations and the security line at the airport.5. Skeletons in our midstThe Las Vegas Strip runs glitter and overkill all the way through town, but at its center stand two enormous, unfinished structures, incongruous in rust and darkness. There's the Fontainebleau, kin to the famous Miami hotel: 68 stories high, vacant since construction started in 2007 at an estimated $3 billion cost.Across the street was the legendary Stardust, busy until the day it was closed in 2006. Local casino corporation Boyd Gaming bought it up and tore it down, intending to build an ultraluxurious megaresort with Mondrian and Delano hotels, shopping, convention space, multiple theaters ... They got as far as the girders before the recession hit in 2008. Now, a Chinese-themed resort from Genting Group is expected to open on the site in 2018.6. The famous casino that isn'tThe Tangiers was the setting of \"Casino,\" perhaps the best movie made about Las Vegas; the Tangiers was also a recurring plot point/location on \"CSI.\" However, the Tangiers doesn't exist. \"Casino\" was inspired by events at the Stardust but, for legal reasons, the name was changed in the film, a name that was then picked up for the TV show. Some folks assume it was torn down, when actually it never existed to begin with.7. Everyone plays Vegas nowThe Vegas headliner is no longer a crooner in a toupee and pinky ring, as an increasing number of more contemporary artists give Sin City the long run. The pediment of Caesars Palace is adorned not with the visages of Jupiter, Apollo and Venus but Elton John, Rod Stewart and Celine Dion. Britney Spears bumps and grinds at Planet Hollywood, while Boyz II Men brings harmony to the Mirage. 8. More than slots and diceGambling is no longer the main motivator of a trip to Vegas. The nightclub is one of the newer draws, as lavish megaclubs seem to open every month with over-the-top decor, four-figure bottle service and a roster of superstar DJs. (Of course, dropping the price of a used car on a night out can make the rest of the trip a five-to-a-room event with Budweiser and Hot Pockets.) A more mature crowd is lured by the city's status as a foodie destination. The classic steakhouse and coffee shop offerings have expanded into a dazzling array of restaurants, from exquisitely prepared tasting menus with meticulously paired wines surrounded by museum-quality art to comfort food of all cultures, served under bright lights to finger-licking crowds. Celebrity chefs from Thomas Keller to Gordon Ramsay have resort-property eateries.Even if big names above the door don't mean much to you, they have given many a local chef a career boost. Beloved local restaurants such as Honey Salt, Fat Choy and Eat were all created by chefs who got their training on the Strip.9. Halloween every dayThere are many people in Las Vegas who make their living pretending to be someone else, meaning you might see \"Michael Jackson\" in hat, glove and shades waiting at the bus stop. Elvis impersonators work big showrooms, casino lounges and wedding chapels, so it is not uncommon to see a man in white jumpsuit and full sideburns buying kitty litter or pumping gas into his Honda. Other fake famous folks do tribute shows, parties or just stand around hoping someone will tip for a photo with \"Marilyn.\" Or \"Tupac.\" Or Barney.10. Where Vegas is still \"Vegas\"There are still some spots that retain the mojo of when Dino was at the Sands and Dietrich was at the Sahara. The Golden Steer Steakhouse has been velvet wallpaper and sirloin since 1958, and you can still sit in Elvis' booth, sipping a martini while the veteran waiter creates your tableside Caesar salad or cherries jubilee. The Huntridge Tavern and the Hard Hat Lounge are both Kennedy-era dive bars, the first with an attached drugstore and lunch counter, the latter with glorious pulp-art murals. Frankie's Tiki Room has a new interior, but the retro-Polynesian style is pure throwback. And there's still a casino that retains its original style.The El Cortez is in the original 1941 building, with vintage neon on the roof and an Elvis impersonator in the lounge.First published in 2014, this story was updated in November 2016.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/travel/las-vegas-10-things-bourdain/index.html"}

{"_id":"2 senior officials ask for head of NSA to be replaced","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The defense secretary and director of national intelligence have asked President Barack Obama to replace the head of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael Rogers, a US official familiar with the matter confirms to CNN.The recommendation by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was made last month, according to The Washington Post, which first reported the recommendation.The replacement of such a senior person would be unprecedented at a time when the US intelligence community has repeatedly warned about the threat of cyberattacks.A major reason for their recommendation is the belief that Rogers was not working fast enough on a critical reorganization to address the cyberthreat. The Obama administration has wanted to keep the NSA dealing with signals intelligence, which would be a civilian-led agency, and a separate cybercommand which would remain under the military, the official told CNN. Right now, one man, Rogers, heads both. He took over as head of the NSA and Cyber Command in April 2014.The official said the initial plan was to announce the reorganization and that given the shift of personnel, Rogers would be thanked for his service and then move on.Another issue -- but not the sole driving factor in removing Rogers, according to the source -- is a continuing concern about security. Harold Martin, a former contractor for Booz Allen who was working at the NSA, has been charged and is being held without bail after allegedly stealing a large amount of classified information. Prosecutors allege he stole the names of \"numerous\" covert US agents. He was arrested in August after federal authorities uncovered what they have described as mountains of highly classified intelligence in his car, home and shed, which they said had been accumulated over many years.Martin's motivation remains unclear, and federal authorities have not alleged that he gave or sold the information to anyone.Potential role in Trump administrationSeparately, this comes as Rogers is one of those under consideration by President-elect Donald Trump to be the next director of national intelligence, CNN has previously reported. Rogers went on a private trip on Thursday to meet with Trump, a trip that took many administration officials by surprise.Some officials also have complained about Rogers' leadership style, according to the Post.The Pentagon declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the director of national intelligence. The NSA did not return a request for comment.The idea for dividing NSA's efforts has been in the works for a while.\"So we had them both in the same location and able to work with one another. That has worked very well, but it's not necessarily going to -- the right approach to those missions overall in the long run. And we need to look at that and it's not just a matter of NSA and CYBERCOM,\" Carter told a tech industry group in September.CNN's Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/politics/michael-rogers-national-security-agency/index.html"}
{"_id":"2011 Japan Earthquake - Tsunami Fast Facts","articleText":" (CNN)Here's a look at the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March of 2011.March 11, 2011 - At 2:46 p.m., a 9.1 magnitude earthquake takes place 231 miles northeast of Tokyo at a depth of 15.2 miles.The earthquake causes a tsunami with 30-foot waves that damage several nuclear reactors in the area. It is the largest earthquake ever to hit Japan.Number of people killed and missing:(Source: Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency)The combined total of confirmed deaths and missing is more than 22,000 (nearly 20,000 deaths and 2,500 missing). Deaths were caused by the initial earthquake and tsunami and by post-disaster health conditions.Other Facts:At the time of the earthquake, Japan had 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, and 17 power plants, that produced about 30% of Japan's electricity (IAEA 2011).Material damage from the earthquake and tsunami is estimated at about 25 trillion yen ($300 billion).There are six reactors at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi plant, located about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. A microsievert is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage. People are typically exposed to a total of about 1,000 microsieverts in one year. The Japanese government estimated that the tsunami swept about five million tons of debris offshore, but that 70 percent sank, leaving 1.5 million tons floating in the Pacific Ocean. The debris was not considered to be radioactive. Timeline:All times and dates are local Japanese time. March 11, 2011 -  At 2:46 p.m., an 8.9 magnitude earthquake takes place 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. (8.9 = original recorded magnitude; later upgraded to 9.0, then 9.1.)- The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issues a tsunami warning for the Pacific Ocean from Japan to the U.S. About an hour after the quake, waves up to 30 feet high hit the Japanese coast, sweeping away vehicles, causing buildings to collapse, and severing roads and highways. - The Japanese government declares a state of emergency for the nuclear power plant near Sendai, 180 miles from Tokyo. Sixty to seventy thousand people living nearby are ordered to evacuate to shelters.March 12, 2011 - Overnight, a 6.2 magnitude aftershock hits the Nagano and Niigata prefecture (USGS).- At 5:00 a.m., a nuclear emergency is declared at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Officials report the earthquake and tsunami have cut off the plant's electrical power, and that backup generators have been disabled by the tsunami.  - Another aftershock hits the west coast of Honshu - 6.3 magnitude. (5:56am)- The Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency announces that radiation near the plant's main gate is more than eight times the normal level.- Cooling systems at three of the four units at the Fukushima Daini plant fail prompting state of emergency declarations there.- At least six million homes - 10 percent of Japan's households -  are without electricity, and a million are without water.- The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake appears to have moved Honshu, Japan's main island, by 8 feet and has shifted the earth on its axis.- About 9,500 people - half the town's population - are reported to be unaccounted for in Minamisanriku on Japan's Pacific coast.March 13, 2011 - People living within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of the Fukushima Daini and 20 kilometers of the Fukushima Daiichi power plants begin a government-ordered evacuation. The total evacuated so far is about 185,000.- 50,000 Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel, 190 aircraft and 25 ships are deployed to help with rescue efforts.- A government official says a partial meltdown may be occurring at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant, sparking fears of a widespread release of radioactive material. So far, three units there have experienced major problems in cooling radioactive material.March 14, 2011 - The U.S. Geological Survey upgrades its measure of the earthquake to magnitude 9.0 from 8.9. - An explosion at the Daiichi plant No. 3 reactor causes a building's wall to collapse, injuring six. The 600 residents remaining within 30 kilometers of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors. - The No. 2 reactor at the Daiichi plant loses its cooling capabilities. Officials quickly work to pump seawater into the reactor, as they have been doing with two other reactors at the same plant, and the situation is resolved. Workers scramble to cool down fuel rods at two other reactors at the plant - No. 1 and No. 3.- Rolling blackouts begin in parts of Tokyo and eight prefectures. Downtown Tokyo is not included. Up to 45 million people will be affected in the rolling outages, which are scheduled to last until April.March 15, 2011 - The third explosion at the Daiichi plant in four days damages the suppression pool of reactor No. 2, similar to an explosion occurring at No. 1 over the weekend. Water continues to be injected into \"pressure vessels\" in order to cool down radioactive material.March 16, 2011 - The nuclear safety agency investigates the cause of a white cloud of smoke rising above the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plans are canceled to use helicopters to pour water onto fuel rods that may have burned after a fire there, causing a spike in radiation levels. The plume is later found to have been vapor from a spent-fuel storage pool.- In a rare address, Emperor Akihito tells the nation to not give up hope, that \"we need to understand and help each other.\" A televised address by a sitting emperor is an extraordinarily rare event in Japan, usually reserved for times of extreme crisis or war.- After hydrogen explosions occur in three of the plant's reactors (1,2, and 3), Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano says radiation levels \"do not pose a direct threat to the human body\" between 12 to 18 miles (20 to 30 kilometers) from the plant.March 17, 2011 - Gregory Jaczko, head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, tells U.S. Congress spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor have been exposed because there \"is no water in the spent fuel pool,\" resulting in the emission of \"extremely high\" levels of radiation.  - Helicopters operated by Japan's Self-Defense Forces begin dumping tons of seawater from the Pacific Ocean on to the No.3 reactor to reduce overheating.  - Radiation levels hit 20 millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re-establish electrical power, \"the highest registered (at that building) so far.\" (Tokyo Electric Power Co.)March 18, 2011 -  Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency raises the threat level from four to five, putting it on a par with the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania. The International Nuclear Events Scale says a Level Five incident means there is a likelihood of a release of radioactive material, several deaths from radiation and severe damage to the reactor core.April 12, 2011 -  Japan's nuclear agency raises the Fukushima Daiichi crisis from Level 5 to a Level 7 event, the highest level, signifying a \"major accident.\" It is now on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union, which amounts to a \"major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures.\"June 6, 2011 - Japan's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters reports reactors 1, 2 and 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant experienced a full meltdown.June 30, 2011 - The Japanese government recommends more evacuations of households 50 to 60 kilometers northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The government said higher radiation is monitored sporadically in this area.July 16, 2011 - Kansai Electric announces a reactor at the Ohi nuclear plant will be shut down due to problems with an emergency cooling system. This leaves only 18 of Japan's 54 nuclear plants producing electricity. October 31, 2011 - In response to questions about the safety of decontaminated water, Japanese government official Yasuhiro Sonoda drinks a glass of decontaminated water taken from a puddle at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.November 2, 2011 - Kyushu Electric Power Co. announces it restarted No. 4 reactor, the first to come back online since the March 11 disaster, at the Genkai nuclear power plant in western Japan.November 17, 2011 - Japanese authorities announce that they have halted the shipment of rice from some farms northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after finding higher-than-allowed levels of radioactive cesium.December 5, 2011 - Tokyo Electric Power Company announces at least 45 metric tons of radioactive water have leaked from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility, and may have reached the Pacific Ocean.December 16, 2011 - Japan's Prime Minister says a \"cold shutdown\" has been achieved at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a symbolic milestone which means the plant's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time.December 26, 2011 - Investigators report poorly trained operators at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant misread a key backup system and waited too long to start pumping water into the units, according to an interim report from the government committee probing the nuclear accident. February 27, 2012 - Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation, an independent fact-finding committee, releases a report claiming the Japanese government feared the nuclear disaster could lead to an evacuation of Tokyo while at the same time hiding its most alarming assessments of the nuclear disaster from the public as well as the United States.May 24, 2012 - TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Co.) estimates about 900,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials were released between March 12 and March 31 in 2011, more radiation than previously estimated.June 11, 2012 - 1,324 Fukushima residents lodge a criminal complaint with the Fukushima prosecutor's office, naming Tsunehisa Katsumata, the chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) and 32 others responsible for causing the nuclear disaster which followed the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and exposing the people of Fukushima to radiation.June 16, 2012 - Despite public objections, the Japanese government approves restarting two nuclear reactors at the Kansai Electric Power Company in Ohi in Fukui prefecture, the first reactors scheduled to resume since all nuclear reactors were shut down in May 2012.July 1, 2012 - Kansai Electric Power Co. Ltd. (KEPCO) restarts the Ohi nuclear plant's No. 3 reactor, resuming nuclear power production in Japan for the first time in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown following the tsunami.July 5, 2012 - The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report finds that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis was a \"man-made disaster\" which unfolded as a result of collusion between the facility's operator, regulators and the government. The report also attributes the failings at the plant before and after March 11 specifically to Japanese culture.July 23, 2012 - A Japanese government report is released criticizing TEPCO. The report says the measures taken by TEPCO to prepare for disasters were \"insufficient,\" and the response to the crisis \"inadequate.\"October 12, 2012 - TEPCO acknowledges in a report it played down safety risks at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant out of fear that additional measures would lead to a plant shutdown and further fuel public anxiety and anti-nuclear movements.July 2013 - TEPCO admits radioactive groundwater is leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima Daiichi site, bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water.August 28, 2013 - Japan's nuclear watchdog Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) says a toxic water leak at the tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant has been classified as a level 3 \"serious incident\" on an eight-point International Nuclear Event Scale (lINES) scale.September 15, 2013 - Japan's only operating nuclear reactor is shut down for maintenance. All 50 of the country's reactors are now offline. The government hasn't said when or if any of them will come back on.November 18, 2013 - Tokyo Electric Power Co. says operators of the Fukushima nuclear plant have started removing 1,500 fuel rods from damaged reactor No. 4. It is considered a milestone in the estimated $50 billion cleanup operation.February 20, 2014 - TEPCO says an estimated 100 metric tons of radioactive water has leaked from a holding tank at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.October 19, 2015 - Japan's health ministry says a Fukushima worker has been diagnosed with leukemia. It is the first cancer diagnosis linked to the cleanup. February 29, 2016 - Three former TEPCO executives are indicted on charges of professional negligence related to the disaster at the Fukushiima Daiichi plant.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/world/asia/japan-earthquake---tsunami-fast-facts/index.html"}

{"_id":"5 reasons Ghanaians don't trust elections","articleText":" (CNN)This week the world turns it spotlight on Ghana as the West African country of 27 million people takes to the polls.However, not all Ghanaians have faith in the electoral process. A recent Afrobarometer report surveying 36 African countries placed Ghana among those with the least trust in elections, with 37% saying they trust their electoral commission somewhat or a lot, compared to 50% across all countries surveyed.Trust plummeted 22 percentage points between 2011 and 2015, the biggest drop among all countries surveyed.\"Ghanaians overall have had some of the biggest declines in views on election quality in comparison to other African countries,\" says lead author Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University. From bribery to fear and intimidation, we take a look at the key reasons behind the distrust, as identified by the researchers.1. Concern about the fairness of vote countsLess than half (42%) of Ghanaians surveyed by Afrobarometer believe that their votes are always or often counted fairly. \"That's lower than the African average. That shows there is some concern about what's going on behind the scenes.\"A poll from October, conducted by the Ghana Centre for Democratic Development (CDD), Afrobarometer's partner in Ghana, showed that 44% of Ghanaians worry that the wrong tally will be announced, with nearly a third (31%) concerned that their votes will not be counted properly, according to Penar, who has analyzed the results.2. Intimidation during campaigns The surveys have also shown that some voters feel pressurized or even intimidated into voting a certain way, according to Penar.\"Some believe there will be consequences to casting the vote for one side or the other. They are afraid they would come under some sort of scrutiny for casting their vote for one party or another.\"When asked how much respondents fear becoming a victim of political intimidation or violence during election campaigns, 36% of Ghanaians answered somewhat or a lot.3. Violence at the pollsAlso violence at the polls may influence the lack of trust, according to Afrobarometer. When asked how often this occurs, the majority of Ghanaians surveyed (59%) said voters are sometimes (30%), often or always (29%) threatened with violence. While not as high as some other parts of Africa, the figure is not to be dismissed.\"If you have even 15% feeling that sense of fear, that's a high number. Any number on there is high,\" Penar says. People have lower expectations when it comes to African countries compared to other parts of the world, he added.4. Bribery and vote-buyingBribery and vote buying have been hot topics in the lead up to this election, Penar says.\"Vote buying can be small things like cash transfers, or money or clothing or food.\"Among Ghanaians surveyed by Afrobarometer, 49% say voters are often or always bribed, with 26% saying sometimes. Across the 36 African countries surveyed, 43% say voters are often or always bribed, with 26% saying sometimes.More recently, 69% of people in the pre-election survey said it was very likely or likely for parties and candidates to buy votes.It's a complicated topic to poll, however, as most people won't admit to taking bribes, which is why the survey's questions instead asked for people's opinion on how often voters are bribed, Penar explains.In a recent CDD poll, for example, 91% said they never had any experience of vote-buying. \"It seems like people think it's going on, but they are not necessarily having major experiences,\" Penar says.The polls have also showed some concern about the so-called power of incumbency, which relates to larger infrastructure projects such as roads and hospitals being built or commissioned in the months leading up to the election.\"There is a lot of talk about this now in Ghana.\" 5. An improving democratic processHowever, there are caveats with looking at public opinion studies, as the results don't necessarily reflect the levels of democracy in a country directly.High levels of distrust among the public could actually be a sign that the country's electoral process is advancing and the level of transparency increasing, according to Penar. \"Once you open the box, you notice that everything is not completely fine when you have that level of transparency.\" \"It leads people to see the inner workings of these processes and the pitfalls that were always there,\" he adds.For example, when Afrobaromer's researchers turned to experts to compare opinions on the freeness and fairness of the last election, they found that ordinary Ghanaians were significantly more critical than the human rights experts at Freedom House.A brighter horizon?Ghanaians seem to show the most distrust in the months and years after an election, which could be attributed to the history of post-election disputes in Ghana. \"Ghana has had a lot of issues with post-election dispute processes and opposition parties not being satisfied with those and some concerns about how elections are managed.\"However, over the past few months Ghanaians appear to have regained some faith in the process for the future, with pre-election polls from CDD contrasting the Afrobarometer surveys, which looked more at past elections.\"From 77% in July, now in October 83% believe that the election will be completely free and fair, or free and fair with minor problems,\" says Penar.\"People are at least giving this election process some space to happen and there is some optimism there.\"CNN's Jason Kwok, Wafaa Ayish and Katy Scott contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/africa/ghana-election-distrust/index.html"}

{"_id":"5 reasons why South Korea's president is unlikely to quit","articleText":" (CNN)Pressure is building on South Korean President Park Geun-hye to stand down after revelations this weekend she's been named as a \"suspect\" by prosecutors in a corruption probe. The president is accused of colluding with three people close to her office, and an investigation will continue into her potential involvement in the unfolding scandal. Park's office said she doesn't have anything to answer for, and has suggested the probe has been politically motivated. Mass protests demanding Park step down show no signs of waning. However, despite the unrest, low approval ratings and the resignations of several key aides, analysts say the president is unlikely to resign.Here's why. 1. With the presidency comes immunityWhile Park remains president she's immune from prosecution, unless for insurrection or treason. If she were to step down, she'd expose herself to potential arrest. Over the weekend, South Korean prosecutors officially indicted three people close to Park.Her confidante Choi Soon-sil and former aide An Chong-bum have been charged with abuse of power, fraud and coercion. Another former aide, Chung Ho-sung,  faces charges related to leaking classified documents to Choi through email, phone and fax.2.  There's no one to take overIn South Korea, the prime ministerial post is largely ceremonial and its been vacant since Park sacked Hwang Kyo-ahn in early November. She nominated Kim Byong-joon, a professor at Seoul's Kookmin University, as his replacement, but the National Assembly has not yet cleared Kim to take the role.Local media reports have suggested that United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon -- who ends his term at the UN in December 2016 -- could run for president.Ban hasn't confirmed speculation that he'll run, though South Korean news agency Yonhap reported in September 2016 that he rated well in approval surveys.However, John Delury, an expert on Korean affairs at Yonsei University, told CNN that Ban's close association with Park's political party and his outsider status could be a disadvantage.3. No push from within her party to go While calls for Park to resign have grown in the wake of her corruption scandal, Paul Cha, an assistant professor specializing in modern Korean history at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN, that there were still no concrete reasons for Park to step down.\"There's been a tremendous domestic outcry and some leaders of opposition political groups have called for her to step down. But, in general, politically, the opposition seems more inclined to seek impeachment. Likewise, her own party has not placed pressure on Park to resign,\" pointed Cha.Cha explained that though media reports had portrayed Park as weak-willed, she was not \"running away\" from public pressure by stepping down.4. A weak opposition While the public has vociferously called for Park to resign, Dave Kang, a professor of international relations and South Korea specialist at the University of Southern California, told CNN that the main opposition parties had not yet backed the public's claims.\"Everyone knows that there will be a power vacuum if she resigns,\" said Kang, noting that political \"chaos\" was likely to ensue. \"That's why the opposition hasn't come out for her impeachment. If Park steps down, elections will be called in 60 days and [the opposition] aren't ready to rule.\"5. Her pedigreePark is the daughter of Park Chung-hee, the country's president from 1961 to 1979, who was assassinated by his own intelligence chief. It came just five years after her mother's own mistaken assassination -- the bullet was meant for former South Korean President Park Chung-hee.The elder Park was seen by many as a dictator who violated human rights and crushed dissent. His daughter fought long and hard to get back into the Blue House to become country's first female president. She's unlikely to give it up without a fight.CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/asia/south-korea-protests-park/index.html"}

General Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.\"While deserving respect for the time he has served our country in uniform, we feel General Flynn is unfit for serving in this critical post,\" the organizations wrote in a statement. \"His appointment will damage America's standing in the world and pose a threat to our national security.\"Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN.In the letter, the organizations list several reasons why they believe Flynn should not serve in this role, which does not require Senate confirmation, including mentioning past Islamaphobic statements he's made and for peddling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.\"He has written that 'fear of Muslims is rational' and said that 'Islam is a political ideology' and 'a cancer' that 'hides behind being a religion,' and continuously peddles the nonsensical fear of 'Shariah law' spreading in the United States,\" the letter said.It also cites two separate occasions that show his ties to foreign governments, including reporting from CNN's Barbara Starr where he leaked classified US intelligence to Pakistan and another CNN report when he was running a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings during the campaign.In the latter instance, Flynn's lobbying company, Flynn Intel Group, had ties to Turkish interests close to the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Some of the other organizations that signed the letter include Veterans For Peace, American Family Voices and Women's Action for New Directions.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-adviser/index.html"}
{"_id":"6 reasons to visit Minas Gerais, Brazil","articleText":"\"Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown\" visits Minas Gerais on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT (CNN)When most people think of Brazil, it goes something like this: Toes in the sands of Copacabana Beach in Rio, sipping on caipirinhas -- the national cocktail crafted with a rum-like spirit distilled from sugar cane called cachaça -- all set to a sun-drenched samba soundtrack. That's nice and all, but Brazil's beauty extends way beyond sun, sand and samba.In the interior state of Minas Gerais, Brazil's heartland beckons. This landlocked wonderland of rolling pastoral hills and postcard-perfect mountains is steeped in colonial history and boasts a culinary pedigree that counts itself among the South American giant's heartiest and richest. This is Brazilian God's country.Deep culinary credibility When Brazilians talk food, they'll usually tell you the gaúchos in the South are the best at beef and Paulistanos are the best at pizza and everything gourmet. But the Mineiros -- as the people of Minas Gerais are known -- are the best at pretty much everything they do in a kitchen. It's impossible to have a bad meal here, but if you are a serious foodie and want to get straight to the heart of this heavy, pork-dependent country cuisine, head straight to the cinematic colonial village of Tiradentes, a place of holy worship for gourmands in the know. Just 7,000 people share six starred restaurants -- the highest per capita in Brazil -- according to Guia4Rodas, Brazil's most respected culinary bible and a soulmate to France's Michelin guides. Your menu? Suckling pig at Leitão do Luiz Ney (Rua do Chafariz s/n), chicken with saffron and ora-pro-nóbis served in a soapstone pot at Virada's do Largo (Rua do Moinho 11), Manuel sem Jaleco (\"Manuel without a Jacket\") at Estralegam do Sabor (Gabriel Passos 280), a comfort-food scramble of sorts with rice, beans, eggs, kale, house-smoked bacon, bananas and a succulent semi-smoked pork loin that spends days maturing in a rudimentary backyard closet.And dessert? Dried guava fruit rolled in cashew nuts and fried, served over a bed of Brazilian cream cheese with guava ice cream at Tragaluz (Rua Direita 52). That cachaça in those caipirinhas we discussed earlier? All of the good ones come from Minas, too. Chase it all down with a top-end artisanal sipping cachaça like Anísio Santiago/Havana. Brazil's bar capitalBelo Horizonte, the state capital, is Brazil's third-largest metropolis (population: 1.4 million), but it is the country's undisputed capital of botecos -- cozy neighborhood bars, a sort of tropical pub, if you will. Known nationally as the \"City of Bars\" (there are about 12,000 botecos, more bars per capita than any other city in the world), Beagá (as it is affectionately nicknamed for the pronunciation of the abbreviated letters \"BH\" in Portuguese) is a very good city for a tipple. The annual Comida di Buteco championship results are a good place to narrow down your bar-hopping list.Colonial historyMinas Gerais is home to some of the most fiercely preserved colonial towns in Brazil. Built on the takings of gold and coffee, cobblestoned living museums like the UNESCO World Heritage-designated old towns of Ouro Preto and Diamantina and the sleepy foodie haven of Tiradentes harbor many of the country's most photogenic streets, flush with whitewashed villas doused in colorful trim and staunchly committed to their centuries-old ways. There is a palpable stuck-in-time feel as you wander these stunning villages a world away from the Atlantic Ocean.The Michelangelo of BrazilFor art and architecture buffs, Minas Gerais is the promised land, mainly due to the presence of works by Brazil's most lauded sculptor, Aleijadinho, often touted as Brazil's Michelangelo. Nothing quite prepares you for the first time you lay eyes on his masterwork and Brazil's single most important piece of colonial art, \"Twelve Prophets,\" at the sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos in Congonhas. Old, sick and crippled, Aleijadinho spent five years between 1800 and 1805 toiling away on 12 Old Testament figures carved from soapstone that pepper the church's courtyard and stairway. It's one of Brazil's surefire 'Wow!' moments.Churches bathed in glamor and gold  In the UNESCO World Heritage old town of Ouro Preto, São Francisco de Assis Church (Largo de Coimbra s/n) boasts a staggering exterior carved by Aleijadinho and is considered his second most important work after Congonhas. Nearby, Basílica Nossa Senhora do Pilar (Praça Monsenhor Castilho Barbosa) is second only to Salvador's São Francisco Church and Convent in sheer opulence: Housing just under half a ton of gold and silver in its nave, it is one of Brazil's most stunning -- and valuable - colonial art treasures. A priest and his maned wolvesA bit off the beaten path even for Brazilians, Parque Natural do Caraça protects some 38-square-miles of transition zone between the Mata Atlântica (Atlantic rainforest) and cerrado (tropical savannah) ecosystems. The park itself is a bounty of blissful nature, but most remarkable for one of Brazil's true oddities: The nightly feeding of the lobo guará (maned wolves), South America's largest wild canine, at Pousada Santuário do Caraça.In true Saint Francis style, the priest at the Catholic-run pousada (inn) worked a tireless two years befriending the wolves and feeding them nightly. Today, after dinner in the monastery's old stone refectory, guests gather on the back porch and wait, speaking in hushed tones and sipping on cachaça, waiting for the wolves to come. When they do, it's a miraculous sight as they slowly saunter up the steps -- lanky, wild and on constant guard -- to gobble up the night's leftovers.

{"_id":"6 takeaways from Donald Trump's New York Times meeting","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump brushed aside his campaign promises to jail Hillary Clinton, batted away questions about conflicts of interest over his business empire and denounced the neo-Nazi movement that is celebrating his victory. Answering questions for just the second time since his election, Trump met for 75 minutes on Tuesday with reporters, editors and columnists from The New York Times. It wasn't broadcast live, but some Times reporters tweeted Trump's remarks in real time. And, since Trump has not held a news conference since his upset win two weeks ago, the entire political world was glued to Twitter through it all. Here are six takeaways from Trump's meeting with the Times: The grudges Trump is still holdingThe President-elect was downright magnanimous toward his longtime Democratic foes. About his campaign promise to jail Hillary Clinton, Trump said he doesn't want to \"hurt the Clintons\" and that doing so would be \"very, very divisive for the country.\"  He heaped praise on President Barack Obama, saying he appreciated Obama's handling of the transition of power and liked him personally. \"I didn't know if I'd like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn't, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot,\" Trump said. And of New York's Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Democratic leader: \"I've liked Chuck Schumer for a long time.\"So it's not the opposition that still gets under Trump's skin. It's his fellow Republicans -- particularly those who ran away from him in the general election. Trump bragged that he \"helped numerous senators\" win, and took a shot New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who narrowly lost after distancing herself from Trump. \"No, thank you,\" he said he told Ayotte about a post in Trump's Cabinet. He also mocked Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican who lost his Senate race after similarly staying far away from Trump. Heck, he said, fell \"like a lead ballon.\"Trump was also cautious about the Republican congressional leaders -- House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"Right now they're in love with me,\" Trump said. \"Four weeks ago, they weren't in love with me.\" A Nixonian conflict-of-interest viewTrump brushed aside questions about how his actions in the White House could benefit his businesses with a startling declaration. \"The law's totally on my side. The president can't have a conflict of interest,\" Trump said. It was reminiscent of Richard Nixon's comment to journalist David Frost that by definition, a president's actions don't violate the law. \"Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal,\" Nixon said. Trump acknowledged his businesses will benefit from his victory, saying his new hotel in Washington is \"probably a more valuable asset than it was before\" and that its brand is \"hotter.\" But he said he's no longer interested in his businesses and will be passing them on to his children. \"I don't care about anything having anything to do\" with his anything outside the United States' best interests, he said. \"I don't want to influence anything.\"A new view on climate change?On the campaign trail, Trump had pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords -- a move that would upend global efforts to address global warming. Tuesday, he wasn't as specific.\"I'm looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it,\" he said. It was part of a broader change for the President-elect on the topic of climate science. He had previously rejected scientists' conclusion that humans have played a role in the earth's warming. But on Tuesday, Trump said that \"I think there is some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, although he declined to elaborate.Trump's white supremacist disavowalDays after the white supremacist movement, known as the \"alt-right,\" gathered in Washington to celebrate Trump's victory, the President-elect said he wants nothing to do with them. \"I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\" he told the Times. \"It's not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\"Also notable is what Trump didn't do: He didn't condemn the white supremacist groups like the National Policy Institute, which led the weekend gathering, by name -- something that's noticed every time Trump personally takes the time to slam the cast of \"Hamilton\" or wade into other feuds on his Twitter account. Trump also took flak recently after he tapped his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be one of his top two advisers in the White House. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, touted the website as \"the platform for the alt-right.\" Bannon rejected the anti-Semitic and racist elements of the alt-right in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week and declared himself an \"economic nationalist.\"Trump defended Bannon in his New York Times meeting, saying that he's known him for \"a long time\" and that the allegations of anti-Semitism and connections to the alt-right are \"not him.\"\"If I thought he was racist, or 'alt-right' ... I wouldn't even think about hiring him,\" Trump said Tuesday.Kushner the peace-maker? Trump laid out some lofty foreign policy ambitions. \"I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. That would be such a great achievement,\" he said, referring to a conflict that has vexed presidents for decades. How is Trump going to do that? It's not clear -- and Trump showed just how limited his foreign policy knowledge is when he suggested his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could help make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. Trump's approach to foreign policy remains an open question. He did tell the Times, \"I don't think we should be a nation-builder\" -- an implicit shot at the American military's role in the Iraq War.He also said \"we have to end that craziness that's going on in Syria,\" adding that he has a \"different view than everybody else\" of that conflict -- without explaining that view.What an age we live inTrump hasn't held a news conference in the 14 days since he won the election -- the longest period of silence from a president-elect in decades. So when he met with The New York Times, the entire political world was watching. But not on screen -- the meeting wasn't live-streamed or televised. Instead, the news came 140 characters at a time from the Twitter accounts of Times reporters like Maggie Haberman, Mike Grynbaum and Julie Davis, who were posting the President-elect's remarks live. Those tweets were being shown on-screen as cable news networks covered the developments, with no audio and no video of Trump -- just tweets containing his remarks. Perhaps fitting for a candidate and President-elect who regularly makes news or causes controversy 140 characters at a time from his phone.CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/takeaways-donald-trump-new-york-times-meeting/index.html"}
{"_id":"6.9-magnitude earthquake strikes off Japan","articleText":" (CNN)A tsunami advisory is in effect for Japan's Fukushima and Miyagi Prefectures after a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck off Honshu just before 6.00 a.m. Tuesday (4.00 p.m. Monday ET).Japanese authorities urged residents in those northeast coastal areas to leave immediately for higher ground and not return until warnings had been lifted. The earthquake struck in the same area as the devastating 9.0-magnitude earthquake in 2011 -- one of the worst ever to hit Japan -- which killed more than 20,000 people and triggered a meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Tuesday's quake struck 37 kilometers (23 miles) east-southeast of Namie at a depth of 11.4 kilometers (7 miles). Four aftershocks of at least magnitude 4.8 were recorded within one hour of the initial quake.Tsunami warnings were immediately issued for waves of 1 to 3 meters (3 to 10 feet), and soon after some were spotted off the coast, according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency. Of prime concern was the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. A cooling pump system was temporarily stopped after the quake but soon resumed operation, a spokesman for the Tokyo Electric Power Company Inc. (TEPCO) told CNN. No abnormalities or change in radiation levels were reported.\"Residents in the region are still struggling to recover from the 2011 event resulting in compound socio-psychological impacts on survivors,\" University of Sydney Disaster Risk Management Expert Dale Dominey-Howes said in a statement.\"Aftershocks will continue in the region for days to weeks to come.\"Small tsunamis reach JapanThe first tsunami wave reached the coast at Iwaki-shi in Fukushima Prefecture at 6:29 a.m. local time. The largest so far, a 1.4-meter tsunami, was observed in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, at 8:03 a.m. according to JMA. Video on social media from Onahama featured sounds of sirens in response to the warning in effect.Images of the port showed waves that the broadcaster described as \"backwash\" that happens before a tsunami hits shore.What to do if a tsunami strikesNHK urged the public to evacuate, cautioning that even if waves appear low in the ocean they can rise as they reach shore. The broadcaster reminded people to dress warmly in the cold rain and urged them to help others leave.\"Please do not think that you are safe. Please evacuate to high grounds,\" the network said. \"Please think about the worst-case scenario and evacuate right away.\"Earthquake felt in TokyoThe tremors could be felt as far Tokyo, where American businessman Jonathan Swanson was having breakfast in a hotel and catching up on e-mail.\"Suddenly I felt disoriented,\" he told CNN's Michael Holmes.Doors started to swing on cabinets and sliding doors started to move. He realized what was happening.\"You could feel the building really swaying back and forth for at least a couple of minutes. It was pretty scary.\"While he was scared he was mindful of the fact that Japan takes its earthquakes seriously. Guests appeared \"calm\" as staffers checked in on everyone.\"They seemed like pros about this,\" he said. \"Everyone very calm and collected.\"Swanson is from San Francisco and has felt his share of tremors over the years.\"But this was significantly bigger than anything I felt in San Francisco ... this was just more extended. The swaying was significantly more than I'd ever felt.\"Japan's long history of earthquakesEarthquakes are common in Japan. The most recent was a 6.2 magnitude in late October near Kurayoshi, a city to the west of Osaka, which caused a handful of injuries. The epicenter of this latest earthquake was not far south of the 2011 quake, which was so severe it moved Japan's coast 8 feet and shifted the Earth's axis, ranking among the costliest natural disasters on record.The devastating 2011 earthquake created huge waves towering as high as 40 meters high.CNN's Radina Gigova, Junko Ogura, Joe Sterling and Taylor Ward contributed to this report.

{"_id":"7 Nigerian filmmakers pushing boundaries beyond Nollywood","articleText":"Nadia Denton is curator of Beyond Nollywood part of the Black Star season at the British Film Institute (BFI) and the author of 'The Nigerian Filmmaker's Guide to Success: Beyond Nollywood'. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)There are some exciting content emerging from the Nigerian film space which is largely obscured from view because it does not fit the Nollywood model. The content on the periphery of Nollywood -- Beyond Nollywood as I have termed it is a growth area within the Nigerian film industry and in my opinion the most likely to cross over internationally.The Beyond Nollywood weekender presents a motley collective of filmmakers who are creating work that subverts Nollywood both in content and style. Creatives who have interesting things to say about Nigerian culture that is frankly not out there and gives some indication of what is to come from this young industry. Director of Green White Green: And All the Beautiful Colours in My Mosaic of Madness, Abba T Makama says that he made his feature to inspire the youth. Young people, who incidentally make up 65% of Nigeria's under 35s rarely appear in Nollywood films. Makama's visual sensitivities come to bear in this coming of age piece, the first art-house indie to emerge from Nigeria. The film had its world premiere at the recent Toronto International Film Festival and will soon appear on Netflix. What's so unique about Makama's direction is his painstaking attention to the craft of filmmaking -- a refreshing change from the slap-and-dash charm of Nollywood productions. Makama, who studied film at New York University refers to himself as a 'creator' shying away from terms like 'artist' and 'filmmaker'. It is perhaps this unwillingness to be categorized that has allowed him to freely explore and paint a new Nigerian film canvas.Young titan director Ishaya Bako hit the headlines in 2012 when his documentary, Fuelling Poverty, a response to the fuel subsidy protests in Nigeria attracted the wrath of the Nigerian Censors Board and was immediately banned. Strong female narrativesBako, a graduate of London Film School has gone on make more socially conscious films including Silent Tears and Henna. Bako has shown himself an unlikely champion of the feminine, making films that have a strong female narrative at its heart. Last year he directed his first feature, Road to Yesterday, with Nollywood starlet Genevieve Nnaji. An activist filmmaker in the making, Bako's direction is most assured when he holds his camera in hand interrogating his society.Tope Oshin is one of Nigeria's most prolific TV directors having overseen nearly 500 episodes of Africa's biggest drama series - Tinsel, Hotel Majestic and Hush. This feisty mother of three takes up the 'gender debate' with much aplomb arguing that \"in any field, a woman is more thorough than her male counterparts.\" Her short film Ireti which is about a woman's bid to be free from the chains that imprison her sees Oshin come into her most expressive self. She comments that she makes films \"to create a perfect version of the flaws [she] sees in the world around [her].\" The Women of Nollywood: Amaka's Kin, is a film that sees Oshin paying tribute to one of the doyins of Nollywood the late Amaka Igwe. Armed with these impressive credits under her belt, Oshin is set to emerge as the female conscience of the Nigeria film industry. LA based video and installation artist Adebukola Bodunrin  is part of an increasing crop of diaspora filmmakers who are reinterpreting indigenous culture in way that takes on an international tone. 'Magic' of storytellingBodunrin, who studied fine arts at the School of the Art, Institute of Chicago creates thought provoking, experimental collage animations that seek to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking in a philosophical way. Her short science fiction influenced animation, The Golden Chain, revisits the Yoruba creation myth. In her own words Bodunrin says 'there is a magical way of moving images that can immerse people', it is some of this 'magic' which if applied to more conventional methods of storytelling could see Bodunrin become a seminal artist and filmmaker of her generation.UK filmmaker Sade Adeniran's debut Commonwealth Writer's Prize novel Imagine, has been read by thousands of Nigerian school children and herein lies a clue to what could be her long term contribution to the industry. Adeniran, who is currently in development with the feature of the same title has written for radio, theatre and film.  Her words jump off the page and this is supremely illustrated in Mrs. Bolanle Benson, a short piece which narrates a 60 year old woman's tryst with her lover. Her family reconciliation film, A Mother's Journey, deals with an issue that Nigerian society does not like to talk about -- in this case women who abandon their children. In Adeniran's writing, Nigerian culture and society become more accessible and should she find the right collaborations she could well become a force within the industry.A key diaspora filmmaker creating transnational Nigerian content is Canada based Lonzo Nzekwe. His 2010 debut Anchor Baby was met with acclaim and went on to become the first Nollywood film on iTunes. In Meet The Parents, Nzekwe comments on his immediate environs, the North American inner-city, presenting the narrative of absentee parenting and its consequences on a young impressionable minds. Nzekwe, a self-taught Director is co-founder of the first black-owned 24-hour television network in Canada, FEVA TV. He is also one of the few filmmakers in the diaspora who have applied themselves to the business of film distribution as much as the creation of content. Remi Vaughan-Richards is the most active female guerilla filmmaker on the ground in Nigeria today. Her shoots have taken her across the country where she is used to 'kicking ass' and being the only woman on set. Not one to shy away from controversy Vaughan-Richards directed the Ford Foundation supported social advocacy piece Unspoken, casting a gaze on the challenging issues of child marriage. Vaughan-Richards studied Design at the Royal College of Art in London and has steadily risen up the film ladder ever since.Her documentary, Faaji Agba, which chronicles the development of indigenous musical forms such as highlife, juju and afrobeat received an Africa Magic Viewer's Choice Award earlier this year.In Vaughan-Richards work, we see a filmmaker who is not afraid to 'go there', focusing a sharp lens onto contemporary Africa.

Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington Bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini (CNN)Last weekend, I went to Mass with my Mom in Vermont. As we were sitting in a pew, she pushed the hymnal in front of me, warning me that the next song was \"Be Not Afraid.\"My eyes always water when we sing that song.Any kid that has gone to Catholic school knows \"Be Not Afraid.\" You never forget it.It also has special meaning in my family. It was sung at my Dad's funeral.The words are truly beautiful: \"Be not afraid, I go before you always.\"When I got home, I was reading the Gospel of Mark, and the familiar story of Jesus walking on water got me thinking about fear.Everyone also knows this story. When I was a kid, I had an illustrated book about it. Plus, every kid tries to walk on water with no success. In Mark's Gospel, Jesus goes out to meet the disciples in a boat, but \"they thought it was a ghost and cried out.\" Jesus' response was \"Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid.\" Mark uses the word \"astounded\" to describe the disciples' reaction. Reading this story with the experience of the last 40 weeks really got me thinking. (It's funny that 40 is such a big number in the Bible.) How does faith tackle fear? I have already confessed to you that I was a pretty scared kid in school. I may have been the only second grader that knew Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words of \"there is nothing to fear, but fear itself\" from his first inaugural address. My Mom turned it into the mantra that got me through the rough days.Heck, I was afraid to write this column.And like other passages that I have written about, I discovered a surprise. It comes after Jesus tells the disciples not to be afraid.  \"They had not understood the incident of the loaves. On the contrary, their hearts were hardened.\" I don't remember this part from my children's book. I also didn't quite understand it. My Bible's footnotes weren't helpful, so I consulted \"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary.\" The hardening of hearts is about not understanding Jesus as the Son of God, the book explains. The disciples hadn't understood the constant stream of miracles -- including the multiplication of the fish and loaves -- was telling them all they needed to know about Jesus. Fear had hardened their hearts, and clouded their eyes.Fear cripples us even to this day. This week especially, there is so much fear and distrust in the world. This passage presented a moment for reflection: How are our hearts hardened against each other? And how can faith help us overcome our fear?

{"_id":"A Catholic reads the Bible, week 42: The Sermon on the Plain ","articleText":"This is Week 42 of a yearlong series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3. Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington Bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini. (CNN)Confession time.Before this project, I thought the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke included the same stories and parables, with just slightly different details, and each week at Mass the readings rotated between the four versions. I am slightly embarrassed to admit this, but that's what I thought before reading the Bible. While there is some truth to my assumption, I was missing much. When I got to Matthew, I couldn't wait to read the story of a young Jesus staying behind in the Temple to preach, much to the consternation of his parents, who thought they had lost him.  When the story was read at Mass during childhood, my Mom would use it as an opportunity to tell us not to wander and stay close. I can hear her saying, \"Can you imagine being Jesus' parents and not knowing where your son was?\" I used to envision a harried Mary and Joseph searching everywhere for their son. Losing the savior -- now that has to be a heavy load of guilt for any parent. But when I got to Matthew, the story wasn't there. Ditto for Mark.  Instead, it's in Luke. \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my father's house?\" Jesus responded when his parents found him. Of course, I now see the deeper meaning in it -- this was Jesus' chance at a young age to preach the new faith. I sort of missed that as a kid.  This one example left me reflecting on the difference in the books. It's the language and the stories that even the casual observer of Catholicism has heard, but all told differently.So far, I like Luke best.Here is another example. I wrote about the Beatitudes in Matthew a few weeks ago. You know, the list of what to do and what not to do, with some parables thrown into it.  You find it in the Gospel of Luke as well. But it is different.\"The Sermon on the Mount\" in Matthew is instead  called a \"Sermon on the Plain\" in Luke -- but geography is just the beginning.As I read through Luke's version, the language felt much more direct and less lofty.And thanks to a project like this, I found myself flipping between Chapter 5 of Matthew and Chapter 6 of Luke to really understand the story.In my estimation, Luke comes out ahead. I particularly latched onto the lesson about how to deal with your enemies. It's applicable to everyday life today:\"Stop judging and you will not be judged. Stop condemning and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.\"Why isn't that embroidered on a pillow? Why isn't that in management 101 seminars?It's that direct language that might just become my new mantra and get me through the challenging times.And it is one I won't forget when I'm done.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/living/catholic-bible-42/index.html"}
{"_id":"A Catholic reads the Bible, week 43: Judgment from beyond the grave ","articleText":" (CNN)My father was known for his dry sense of humor. One day, my cousin did something of which my deceased grandmother would not have approved.My father looked at his nephew and said, \"Nonna is spinning in her grave right now like a rotisserie chicken.\"We all laughed, and my cousin had a vivid image to think about.For some reason, that story popped into my head while I read the story of the rich man and Lazarus in the Gospel of Luke.The nameless rich man ignores the pauper Lazarus during his lifetime and doesn't share his wealth -- not even scraps of food from his table. When they both die, Lazarus ends up in heaven and the rich man winds up in the \"netherworld, where he is in torment.\"Questioning his fate, the rich man is informed by Abraham that he's in hell because he didn't share his blessings with people like Lazarus. The rich man says that he wants to go back and warn his brothers, but Abraham tells him, \"They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.\"My grandmother was devoutly religious, but she was no Abraham. Still, the point is the same, isn't it? Judgment delivered from beyond the grave.There are many times that I have thought about my actions being judged by God. Have I been good or just good enough?My mother was clear that we had to live our lives taking care of others -- donations of time and money have always been central in our actions. But I couldn't stop thinking about my grandmother and how to judge actions.Wouldn't it be great if you could get guidance from your dead relatives? And that's why the Lazarus story kept coming back to me. (By the way, was Lazarus a super-popular name in Jesus' time? The leper was named Lazarus, too.)When the rich man didn't like the explanation in the prophets' message, Abraham responds, \"If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.\"Abraham is engaging in a prophecy here of Jesus' death and the saving purpose of his life on earth. As the footnote points out: \"A foreshadowing in Luke's Gospel of the rejection of the call to repentance even after Jesus' resurrection.\"And maybe this connection only has relevance to me, but as this project starts to come to its completion, I am getting sentimental. There were days during Numbers that I never thought I would get here. But, I am and I feel like my faith has grown.You have to live your life in your faith (and ask forgiveness here and not later).And if even my Nonna was a family prophet, my cousin ended up not listening to my Dad.

Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington Bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini. (CNN)A few years ago, I was going through a pretty rough time at work. I was stress-eating candy bars like they were kernels of popcorn. I wasn't sleeping. I was just constantly worried that I would miss a story or not be prepared for the day ahead.My friend Kim suggested that I read a book, \"One Word That Will Change Your Life\" by Jon Gordon, Dan Britton and Jimmy Page. It is all about changing your life. The book walks you through creating a mantra out of one word that helps you focus for the year ahead.I read the book in a few short hours. I started thinking that my word would be \"hope\" because I needed something to hold onto -- and what's better to latch onto than hope?But I later realized that the word I really needed was joy. I already had hope -- hope my circumstances would change. I needed to find the joy in life and work again. If I wasn't appreciating the little things and working on change, there was no way I could see my many blessings.Joy became my word, and it has been so since January of 2014.During the Rio Olympics, I saw a picture of Kerri Walsh Jennings celebrating her team's beach volleyball victory over Italy to advance to the quarterfinals. There, written on her hand, was my favorite word, \"Joy.\"And then, timed perfectly (as has happened before in this year or so of reading the Bible), \"joy\" jumped off the page in the Book of John.In Chapter 15, Jesus talks about the joy that can be found in faith from keeping a very important commandment. He says, \"I have told you this so that my joy might be in you and your joy might be complete. This is my commandment: love one another as I have loved you.\" (John 15:11-12). In my opinion, Jesus' one commandment is way better than the original 10.Everyone knows the second part of that statement about loving one another, but the fact that Jesus invoked joy had a special meaning for me. It made me think: My year of focusing on my joy now feels much more complete. Just like Jesus notes that joy is the prelude to loving one another, finding joy was the prelude to this project. Maybe that's why my faith has deepened so much during my reading of the Bible, even through the valleys of dry texts.A final note: I sleep well these days and don't eat candy bars. Life, especially with this project, has been really great.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/living/catholic-bible-44/index.html"}
{"_id":"A four-day workweek could be hazardous to your health","articleText":"Many employers and employees love the thought of a four-day workweek. Supposedly, a four-day work schedule allows workers extra time to pursue leisure activities and family togetherness. Spurred on by visions of spending more time at the beach, many people are now encouraging businesses to adopt this kind of work plan.There are many purported advantages. Some authorities say that a four-day work schedule facilitates the ability to provide child care and assistance for the elderly.Proponents of such \"compressed\" work schedules -- those in which employees work longer hours for fewer days of the week --- point to gains in productivity that result from decreased overhead costs, such as not having to keep the lights on when nobody is working. Additional cost savings can be obtained from reducing total weekly commuting time.A variety of business have tested the four-day concept, including Amazon, Google, Deloitte and a host of smaller firms. Amazon announced in late August that it is experimenting with an even shorter workweek of 30 hours for select employees, who would earn 75 percent of their full-time salary, should they choose to opt in.How on-call and irregular scheduling harm the American workforceMany of the pilot programs have shown promising results. Statistics from the Society for Human Resource Management indicate that 31 percent of employees were in a compressed workweek schedule as of 2015. That's the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.This is an issue in which I have considerable experience. I have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. All the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. Most of the studies I have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.It sounded like a good ideaThe idea of a four-day workweek is not new. Labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. For example, in 2008, researchers from Brigham Young University conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. The researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.Based on these positive results, Utah's governor enacted a mandatory four-day workweek for all state employees. The state's goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. In 2011, however, Utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.Could flexible working hours be the answer to the sleep-loss epidemic?Other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. A 1989 study found that compressed schedules (PDF) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees' satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.Are there hidden dangers?Despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, I am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. The primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. Despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.The math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. That's true. But the implications of these schedules are different. The danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.I performed a study showing that the risk of suffering an industrial accident is raised by 37 percent for employees working more than 12 hours in a day. The risk is 61 percent higher for people in \"overtime\" shifts. Working more than 60 hours in a week is related to an additional injury risk of 23 percent. As the hours worked in those schedules increase, the risks grow accordingly.More recently, Dr. Xiaoxi Yao, a colleague of mine who is now at the Mayo Clinic, and I recently performed another study using 32 years of work-hour information to analyze the relationship between long working hours over many years and the risk of being diagnosed with a chronic disease later in life. We found that the dangers were quite substantial, especially for women.Women working more than 60 hours per week, equivalent to 12 hours per day, were more than three times as likely to eventually suffer heart disease, cancer, arthritis or diabetes, and more than twice as likely to have chronic lung disease or asthma, as women working a conventional 40-hour workweek. Working just a bit more, an average of 41 to 50 hours per week, over many years appeared to substantially increase the long-term risk of disease.These studies show that not all hours are created equal. The research suggests that harm may occur past a certain point. A four-day week causes workers to squeeze more hours than usual into a day. For workers who are already prone to overwork, the additional burden of compressing five days into four could literally break the camel's -- or worker's -- back.Is the stress worth it?Besides the health issues, employers and workers also need to consider the effect that compressing hours into a four-day period has on workers' mental health, stress levels and fatigue.Every weekend could be four days long if the will was thereOccupational psychologists realize that people do not function as effectively when tired or stressed. This may be even more of a concern for older persons.Moreover, just squeezing five days of 10-hour-a-day work into a compressed 40-hour schedule can create more rigidity and reduced flexibility for families and children. For example, if the two additional work hours per day are added onto a conventional day schedule that begins in the morning at approximately 8 or 9 a.m. and extends into the late afternoon hours at about 4 to 5 p.m., then many working parents will lose the ability to interact with their children just at the \"prime time\" of about 5 to 7 p.m. when kids otherwise would be most likely to be in the house and potentially available to socialize with their siblings and parents -- before their bedtime arrives.There are many obvious ways to address these concerns and make life easier for workers and their families. Don't overwork. Don't stay too long at work. Find a job with an employer that has flexible working hours.I don't know about you, but the prospect of a four-day week scares me. I already have a hard enough time getting my regular weekly work done over five days. And it's always so tempting to glance at my work email -- just a couple more notes to jot down.Instead, why not just pull back at a certain point? Maybe it's time to take Friday off every so often. How about ending work at noon on Fridays, as is the practice of many Jews, to bring in the weekend in a gradual way? The trade-off, if necessary, would involve adding a small increase of one hour per day to the normal Monday through Friday schedule. That approach is actually my personal favorite.My friend Lonnie Golden, a professor at Pennsylvania State University - Abington, advocates adopting a \"Goldilocks\" workweek: one that is not too long, not too short and that satisfies the employer's interest in productivity and the employee's interest in attaining good health and well-being.Allard Dembe is a professor of public health at The Ohio State University.Copyright 2016 The Conversation.

{"_id":"A message from the people of Aleppo to the world","articleText":" (CNN)They stand tall and proud in front of a crumbling skyline, the exhaustion of their cause written on their faces. Dressed in the uniforms of their trades, the men hold Syrian opposition flags and a woman clutches a baby. They are a coalition of activists consisting of doctors and civil servants from Aleppo's rebel-held areas. In a rare video message in English, they issue a desperate plea for humanitarian aid from the US-led coalition -- via airdrop. An English-speaking Syrian doctor known as Dr. Hamza al-Khatib stands in the middle of the group. He runs through a grim accounting of Aleppo's misery, based on numbers from this coalition of activists:500,000 people killed in six years, he says; At least 271,536 people trapped inside rebel-held eastern Aleppo, he says, citing Aleppo City Council;At least 2,300 documented strikes in the last 23 days: Airstrikes, explosive barrels, artillery, cluster bombs, bunker-busters, bombs loaded with chlorine gas;4 hospitals struck in the last week, along with 6 schools, the civil defense headquarters and 2 bakeries.  CNN cannot independently verify the number of people killed in Syria, but the United Nations puts the figure at around 400,000.Al-Khatib accuses Russian and Syrian regime air forces of intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure to \"break people's will,\" though Russia has denied targeting civilian infrastructure. Starving, dying people with little to no access to medical care are afraid to go to hospitals, he says, lest they became the victims of the latest bombing.The past six years have been a \"slow-motion train wreck,\" leaving him and his colleagues wondering what good is the United Nations, he says. He appeals to the international community to push for the following:Ground Bashar al-Assad's air force or use diplomatic leverage to end Russian and Syrian bombardment of the city. Open a demilitarized humanitarian corridor under the United Nations' control for food, fuel, medicine and infrastructure supplies for water stations, electricity, hospitals, schools and civil defense.If neither is possible, airdrop humanitarian aid using the US-led coalition's warplanes in Syria. The international community holds Aleppo's fate in its hands, he says. Will it heed their cry?","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/middleeast/message-from-people-of-aleppo-to-the-world/index.html"}

{"_id":"A new perspective of our planet","articleText":" (CNN)On Christmas Eve in 1968, Apollo 8 made the first manned mission to the moon. Live broadcasting from the spacecraft was the three-man crew of Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders, and it was on that day that their journey led them to an unexpected sight.\"Oh my God, look at that picture over there!\" Anders said at the time. \"There's the Earth comin' up. Wow, is that pretty!\"About 45 years after Anders snapped his one-of-a-kind \"Earthrise\" photograph -- showing us our marble-like planet rising from behind the moon -- a man named Benjamin Grant would see an unexpected sight as well.On December 14, 2013, Grant was preparing a talk about satellites for the space club he set up at his workplace. He went on a mapping program and searched for some images. On a whim, he typed in \"Earth,\" hoping to find a picture of the entire planet. But unlike the Apollo 8 crew, Grant's one-man mission led him not to Earth, but to Earth, Texas.\"What I saw when I clicked 'Enter' was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen,\" Grant said, adding that his screen filled up with a bunch of circles. \"I am huge fan of abstract art and art history and I had never seen anything like that before. But it was beautiful and it was stunning and I had no idea what I was seeing.\"Turns out, those circular hues of green and brown were rows of rotating sprinklers used for a type of agricultural farming known as pivot irrigation.\"I soon enough became obsessed with looking for these new patterns, these new stories to tell using this perspective,\" Grant said.Grant's upcoming book, \"Overview: A New Perspective of Earth,\" contains more than 200 satellite images, showing us that within the blues and greens and whites of the Earth exists a kaleidoscope of colors and places.\"Overview\" stems from the \"Overview Effect,\" a term coined by science writer Frank White. It refers to the sort of shift in perspective that various astronauts and cosmonauts have said they experienced during spaceflight, such as when they view Earth while in orbit.\"That idea was very much on my mind and very inspirational for me, which really is the reason I typed in 'Earth' into the search bar in the first place,\" Grant said. \"That idea of inspiring this new perspective or showing people the planet in a way they've never seen before has been at the core of the project from the very beginning, and is really what I hope to inspire with the book and with the work that I'm doing.\"Grant uses satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, and every creation in \"Overview\" has been stitched together using various tiles of satellite imagery. One of the major considerations when deciding what to create has to do with aesthetic appeal. \"I spend a lot of time trying to figure out the best way or the most aesthetic way to present the images,\" he said. \"When I get the raw imagery from the satellite company, it doesn't look anything like the images you see in the book. I take the time to compose it in whatever way I think is most alluring or most mesmerizing.\"Composing the images in a way that draws people in is important because it opens a window into people's minds, the former design consultant says. They become more inquisitive and interested in what they're seeing.\"I think if I do a good job composing an image, that will lead someone to ask questions and ask me, 'What is it?' rather than making it obvious or immediately clear what it is,\" Grant said. \"That's  an important piece of these images. It's really tapping into the mystery or to the power of the 'Overview Effect' and what we can get from looking at the world in this way.\"But there's more than meets the eye. Grant's book isn't just a collection of pretty pictures, it's an insightful experience into the state of our planet. The story precedes the beauty; it's only after Grant researches a question -- such as, \"Where are the largest or most well-known solar panel facilities?\" -- that the process of stitching together an image begins.\"If you're looking at these places on the ground, you can't understand the full scale of what's going on; you can't necessarily see all of the processes that are in place,\" Grant said. \"As we look to the future and look to create a more sustainable planet, that will not just happen spontaneously. I think people need the knowledge and the awareness to know what's going on before they start acting in service of the planet.\"\"Overview\"  is divided into nine major parts: Where We ... Harvest. Extract. Power. Live. Move. Design. Play. Waste. Are Not. Each part not only shows, but tells us something about the planet we call home.In the \"Where We Harvest\" section, Grant highlights the way we rely on our environment to cultivate plants and raise animals. It's here where the image of the tulips in Lisse, Netherlands -- seen in photo No. 3 in the gallery above -- makes a stunning appearance.\"The people who are planting those tulips ... are just kind of going about their business and making sure those flowers are as beautiful as possible and bloom as well as possible,\" he said. \"That is going on, but at the same time that creates this unbelievable tapestry of color and control and design from above and it's just magnificent.\"And in \"Where We Design,\" one of the major focuses is on urban planning, where Grant takes us on a journey into how the layout of cities affects everything from the way we interact with one another to the way we transport ourselves and move about.\"We're going to need smart, well-designed, sustainable cities in the future as more of us move into urban centers and have to live in cities that work well for us,\" Grant said. \"This book could also be showing a problem, but in another perspective, it could also be presenting solutions or helping people understand what works well and what we can do to create a better and smarter, safer, world for us in the future.\"Mont Saint-Michel in photo No. 9, off the coast of Normandy, France, is included in \"Where We Design.\" In the image we see a monastery surrounded by water, which Grant writes is only accessible to pilgrims during low tide.\"You have again this ingenuity of farming and agriculture that I'm sure has been going on there for centuries, as well as the history of the architecture of the building that was constructed there,\" he said. \"It's just phenomenal to see.\"Seeing the Earth from this perspective is truly a unique experience. Grant notes how just a little more than 550 humans, out of the billions who have ever existed, have been to space and have had the opportunity to see our planet in a whole new light. \"Through the project, I've been lucky enough to meet a number of astronauts and discuss the perspective in the images with them,\" he said. \"It was great to hear many of them say it reminded them of the feeling they had when they were in the International Space Station when they were in lowered orbit.\"But just because so few have been to outer space, doesn't mean there isn't an interest in gaining a new perspective of our home. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s. And while it sounds cool for sure, what it all comes down to is an intense desire and need to learn about and understand our home from a perspective that just so happens to be as intellectually profound as it is aesthetically profound.\"The astronauts who have seen the Earth from outer space and seen the Earth as a whole get a new perspective of what our planet looks like, how fragile it is, how amazing it is, how interconnected we are,\" Grant said. \"And then when we tap into that perspective and we look at our own planet and we see what we're doing, we have a new way of looking at ourselves. We have a new way of looking at our species and what's going on, and a new story to tell about the state of our planet and what we have to do to protect it.\"Benjamin Grant is the founder of \"Daily Overview.\" His book is now available for pre-order.

{"_id":"A one-way plane ticket saved Andrew Zimmern's life","articleText":" (CNN)Long before he became famous for traveling the world and eating bizarre foods on TV, Andrew Zimmern was sprinting down a destructive path of drug and alcohol addiction.The bald celebrity chef discovered as a teen that alcohol could dull his senses and cut off his emotions.\"You feel all the things that traumatized you or gave you anxiety or depressed you disappear,\" Zimmern says. \"And you say to yourself 'Eureka! I have found it.' You have found the thing that you believe is the solution to your problems.\"Alcohol numbed his pain as he struggled to cope with his mother being in a coma and, ultimately, in a series of mental hospitals.\"By the time I was in 10th grade, I was a daily drinker, a daily pot smoker, a daily pill taker,\" recalls Zimmern.Junior year he added daily cocaine user to the list.\"I just became a snorting, speedball freak with a lot of pills and pot and booze,\" he admits. \"I created a balance of chemicals in my body that actually allowed me to be very high functioning for many, many years.\"Zimmern graduated college after a \"seven-year plan\" and started cooking at some highbrow restaurants in New York City. But his addictions caught up with him.\"You start to lose jobs,\" he says. \"I lost an apartment. l became homeless for 11 months and squatted in a building on Sullivan Street in lower Manhattan.\"He stole to support his habit.\"I knew something was wrong with that. I was crossing lines that I never thought I would cross before.\"Zimmern couldn't see a way out of his situation. He wanted it all to end and spent three days in a flophouse trying to drink himself to death. That failed, and eventually a group of friends arranged an intervention.\"If that hadn't happened I would be dead,\" he states.\"I got a one-way ticket to Minnesota, a couple packs of smokes and $20,\" he remembers. \"I had a surrender experience where I said 'I'm done. I quit. I can't do this anymore. My life has become unmanageable and I'll do whatever it takes.' That night I could have sobered up in a liquor store.\"He flew to Minneapolis and admitted himself to the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, a well-respected treatment facility where many of his friends had gotten help. Several weeks later, Zimmern transferred to a halfway house that required him to get a job. He ended up working as a dishwasher in a downtown Minneapolis restaurant.\"One day, one of the line cooks called in sick, and I went to the owner and the chef and I said 'I can do that guy's station.' And they laughed,\" recalls Zimmern. \"Eventually, they couldn't find anyone to replace him so they didn't have a choice.\"Zimmern worked the grill station. Afterward, the shocked owner called him into the office.\"He said 'Can you please explain to me why the dishwasher just put out food in my restaurant that looks better than when my chef puts food out in my restaurant?'\" Zimmern smiles. \"The day I got out of the halfway house, he fired his chef and made me his partner. I restaffed the restaurant with some incredible cooks, most in recovery.\"The chef remade his career in the Twin Cities for the next seven years and then noticed the food media world was starting to explode.\"I had a five-year plan to get a television show. First step: quit the restaurant. Step two: get jobs in media so I could learn how to do this thing,\" explains Zimmern.He took jobs working for free at the local radio station, magazine and TV station.\"My strategy was to become so invaluable that they have to pay me,\" he laughs. \"And I got a job at all three and did that for quite a while.\"At the same time, Zimmern kept pitching show ideas to Food Network and was rejected repeatedly. Then he had \"a true epiphany.\" He recognized travel shows did not explore food culture, and he thought, \"You can tell the history of people on a plate.\"That idea transformed into \"Bizarre Foods\" and debuted on Travel Channel in 2006. The series is still going strong today, as is Zimmern's quest to remain clean.On January 28, he will enter his 26th year of sobriety.\"What used to be very destructive stubbornness, has now become a strong determination to succeed at things. Channeled in the right way the boundless energy that I had as an addict and alcoholic has become a tremendous part of my success.\"Much of that energy is focused on helping others battling addiction and homelessness.\"I'm no saint and I don't want to come across like one, but there is not a day that goes by that I'm not doing something for someone else with a very large chunk of my time,\" the 55-year-old says. \"That's my medicine. If I don't do that, I turn back into that selfish, self- centered person and then I lose my spiritual connection with the people around me, and I'm picking up that next drink or drug.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/health/turning-points-andrew-zimmern/index.html"}

{"_id":"A traffic accident kept them from their wedding reception. But not their first dance","articleText":" (CNN)There's nothing more touching than a just-married couple's first dance -- even when it's on a highway.An Ohio couple found themselves slow dancing on the pavement Saturday night, right after they got married at a church in Beavercreek, Ohio. They were headed to their wedding reception at Top of the Market Banquet Center in downtown Dayton -- normally a 10-minute drive up U.S. 35 -- when they got caught in a traffic backup caused by an accident.The newlyweds -- who wish to remain anonymous -- were stuck on the road for two hours, along with Levi Curby, their wedding videographer, when someone suggested they get out of their vehicle and dance right there on the road.Curby -- who was about two cars behind the couple -- said it all started when people noticed the bride's wedding dress. \"It was actually some strangers from Kansas,\" Curby told CNN. \"They noticed the wedding dress and asked what (the newlyweds) would be doing if they weren't stuck in traffic.\"The groom said he'd be dancing at the reception at about that time.So people said \"let's have the reception here and you can do your dance.\"And dance they did, as people left their vehicles and snapped photos on their cells phones, while Curby videotaped. They danced for several minutes to Alison Krauss' \"When You Say Nothing At All.\" Curby said someone found the bluegrass-pop tune on Spotify and pumped it through a car stereo.\"I've never filmed anything like that before,\" Curby said. \"It was a really special moment.\"Soon after, the newlyweds were freed from the gridlock when a friend of the groom's father pulled up in the opposite lane. Curby said the friend pulled up to the guardrail, with flashers blinking, and the bride and groom hopped over and got in and headed on to the wedding reception.\"It was amazing that the kindness of strangers, who noticed our dilemma, was able to turn around a difficult situation,\" the newlyweds -- now on their honeymoon in an undisclosed location -- said in a statement. \"We are so moved by their kindness and we will always have a wonderful story of how our life together began. We are so thankful for the positive response our story has received.

{"_id":"A transgender Marine comes out, tests military's new policy","articleText":" (CNN)Lance Cpl. Aaron Wixson is looking forward to the day he can attend the annual Marine Corps Ball in the outfit he feels most comfortable in.Last Friday, he wore female Dress Blues to the gala at Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, California. But next year, Wixson hopes to trade in the female uniform for the iconic Dress Blues worn by men -- the gender he identifies with even though it's not the one on his birth certificate.\"I will feel that I am finally seen as who I really am,\" Wixson told CNN, going public for the first time with his gender transition, which is ongoing. \"I will be 100 times more comfortable, physically and mentally -- which will allow me to really enjoy the ball.\"He's getting closer to his goal thanks to the new military policy that allows transgender people to serve openly. The 20-year-old field artillery radar operator is one of the first transgender Marines to be formally recognized by his command as a man.The Tulsa, Oklahoma, native is utilizing the military's recently adopted \"gender transition process,\" which took effect October 1. The policy, put in place after the Pentagon lifted the ban a few months earlier on transgender people serving, sets guidelines for troops who are transitioning to access healthcare. After Wixson completes his treatment plan, his name and gender will change in the Department of Defense database, and he can start dressing like a man and using male facilities.The policy is part of the Pentagon's latest effort to make the military more inclusive, which top military leaders acknowledge is a work in progress. LGBT advocates applauded the military for taking the step but are waiting to see how the policy is fully implemented. Wixson's command at the 11th Marine Regiment Headquarters at Camp Pendleton, California, helped arrange his interview with CNN to show its support for him and his transition.Wixson enlisted in 2014, when he was still living as a woman. He had completed his freshman semester at Rogers State University in Oklahoma on a golf scholarship but the pull of the Marines was stronger. The Pentagon recently had opened combat to women and the self-described \"tomboy\" was set on becoming one of the first females in the infantry.Earlier this year, a military mental health provider diagnosed Wixson with \"gender dysphoria,\" a condition in which a person's gender identity differs from his or her birth sex. Knowing that a repeal of the military's transgender ban was in the offing, Wixson came out to his command as transgender. With the help of his command, Wixson came up with a treatment plan to have his gender changed to male in the Department of Defense database, a change that would allow him to conform to male grooming standards and fitness requirements. For now, he's still using female bathrooms and uniforms.A 'minimal' impact on troop readinessSecretary of Defense Ash Carter in June repealed the military's ban on transgender men and women serving in its ranks.\"Although relatively few in number, we're talking about talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction. We want to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we've invested in and who've proven themselves,\" Carter said at the time.LGBT advocates called it a watershed moment, especially for transgender troops who have long been serving but could not be officially recognized. Critics, however, said they feared Carter's policy change would damage troop morale and unit readiness, as well as drive up the cost of healthcare.A Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Department of Defense and published earlier this year concluded that letting transgender people serve openly would have a \"minimal impact\" on readiness and health care costs, largely because there are so few in the military's 1.3 million-member force.The study put the number of transgender people in the military between 1,320 and 6,630. Gender-change surgery is rare in the general population, and the RAND study estimated the possibility of 30 to 140 new hormone treatments a year in the military, with 25 to 130 gender transition-related surgeries among active service members. The cost could range from $2.4 million and $8.4 million, an amount that would represent an \"exceedingly small proportion\" of total health care expenditures, the study found.Wixson is encouraged by the military's response to his transition so far.\"They've worked very, very hard to get me the help I need and help me get through this process,\" he said. \"I'm very lucky and grateful for their support.\"His commanding officer, Col. Walker Field, said in an email that Wixson's decision to forgo an athletic educational scholarship and enlist showed his \"exceptional character and patriotism.\"\"We are lucky to have such talent in our ranks and will benefit from his retention if he decides to undertake a subsequent tour of duty,\" Field added. \"Every Marine in this command deserves the very best opportunity to reach his or her full potential, including LCpl Wixson. Enabling LCpl Wixson to openly serve as a transgender Marine necessarily increases readiness and broadens the overall talent of the organization.\"\"Culture takes longer to change than policy'Wixson may have his command's support, but many say it's too soon to tell whether others will experience the same acceptance. Advocacy groups have also criticized the Pentagon for not extending the healthcare benefits to dependents, retirees or veterans.\"There's so much fear in the transgender community. The policy is saying, 'yes, we support you,' but everyone wants to make sure the culture is supportive,\" said Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King, who came out as a transgender woman last year after more than a decade in the military.\"Culture takes longer to change than policy,\" she added. When King began her transition, before the Pentagon lifted the ban, her command told her that they were behind her but did not have the authority to allow her to serve openly as a woman. At work, she used the men's restroom and barracks; at home, King wore makeup and dresses to meet friends and family socially after work.\"We finally removed the elephant from the room and let us get down to business of doing our jobs,\" King said of Carter's ending the ban on transgender service. \"When you're a closeted transgender person, it's not something that interferes with your ability to do your job, but it's always there. It's this nagging thing that you're always dealing with in the background. I'm excited that the DOD has come around.\"'Something didn't feel right'Wixson's transition has been a long time coming, too. Growing up as Ariel, he always wanted to be friends with boys and wear boys' clothes. He played all the sports, excelling in soccer and golf, and had a hard time sitting still.In high school, Wixson came out as a lesbian, and that seemed to resolve his mixed emotions -- for the time being.\"It calmed my brain from the feeling of being different,\" he recalled. \"I was OK with that. I was OK with liking girls.\"Marine recruiters visited his high school when he was in 11th grade and sparked his interest in the Corps. The way they carried themselves and the Marines' reputation as the most physically challenging branch of the services spoke to him.\"I knew that's what I wanted to do,\" he told CNN. \"I saw the pride that they had, and I thought, 'I want to be a part of that.'\"The infantry wasn't open to women, so Wixson signed up for artillery. He felt pride in being a female Marine and showing that a woman was physically capable of keeping up with the guys in the unit. That excitement, Wixson realizes now, kept him from addressing a longstanding discomfort with his gender. During combat training, \"something didn't feel right,\" he said. Wixson started talking to transgender friends and the idea that he could be a man in a woman's body began to resonate. The professional diagnosis helped him fully embrace being transgender.His family supports him, and he said he has not faced a backlash from the Marines with whom he serves. They're \"very curious,\" Wixson said. They ask a lot of questions about when he's going to get a haircut or surgery or start using the male restroom. Those who knew him as a woman have a hard time going with new pronouns. But thanks partly to his haircut, a high fade that straddles the line between male and female grooming standards, those who don't know him see him as a man, he said.One hiccup Wixson faced was his decision to seek hormone treatment outside of the military health care system in May without informing his command, a violation of policy. He was slapped with an administrative reprimand that his command is now working to expunge, officials said.After developing a treatment plan with his command, Wixson began hormone treatment through the military healthcare system. He hopes to undergo surgery to remove his breasts before the completion of his treatment plan May 2017. And he may be able to use facilities and adhere to grooming standards for men before then, thanks to an \"exception to policy\" request his command has put in on his behalf. Until then, the male Dress Blues are hanging in his closet, waiting to be worn.\"I'm really grateful to be able to serve openly in the Marine Corps as transgender,\" he said. \"When you get to be yourself you're a much more effective member of the team.\"CNN's Dani Stewart contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/politics/transgender-military-policy/index.html"}

(CNN)Shari Duval knows that dogs can heal.Duval was inspired  to do something after her son, Brett Simon, returned from two tours in Iraq.  Simon was a civilian K9 police officer before joining a special team whose main mission was to work with the Army.\"I was chosen to work with explosive tracking dogs in Iraq. Once I arrived in Iraq in Baghdad, I was shipped out to Mosul, where I worked with the striker brigade working on the first tracking explosive dogs that were attempted in Iraq,\" says Simon.Duval says she wasn't prepared when her son came home diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. \"He was somebody different, he was not my son that went over there. He was completely changed and that was a shock that I've never experienced before, so it was more of panic. What do I do? What can I do?  How do I fix it?\"Duval started researching methods on how to treat persons with PTSD and found that using service dogs was a promising solution. But at the time, there weren't many organizations providing service dogs for veterans.In 2010, she founded K9s for Warriors to help her son and other military veterans with PTSD.  To date, hundreds of veterans have received dogs and a new lease on life.Finding the right dogDuval's son is now the organization's director of K9 operations and selects the dogs and directs their training. K9s for Warriors trains mostly rescue dogs to become certified service canines for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The training can take up to a year before the dogs are ready to help them cope with issues like controlling anxiety attacks or fear of public places. \"We evaluate the dog for being sound around people, other dogs, noises, cars, and riding in the bus,\" says Simon.  \"We take them to the store and walk them around. If they keep progressing through that, then they spend the next three to four months getting their basic formal obedience done.\"The staff will read through applications from veterans to pair them with the right  dog. For three weeks, veterans live at the organization's camp in Florida and go through several training courses with their dogs.The training continues After successfully completing the program, the veterans will have support when they return home including access to an online community via a private Facebook page group.  They can also come back for refresher courses.Kevin Crowell, a graduate of the program, has been back for more classes.  He is now mentoring to other veterans who go through the program.  \"It's still a transition period when you bring the dog home.  My wife had to get used to me spending a lot of time with her as well as Bella coming up and comforting me,\" says Kevin Crowell.  \"It was about six months to a year when things really started to gel and she just became another part of the family.\"Before the K9s for Warriors program, Crowell had problems going out in public.  He had been diagnosed with PTSD and would have nightmares.  His dog Bella now even wakes him up during bad dreams.  Crowell's life has changed for the better and he gives much of the credit to Shari Duval and K9s for Warriors.\"Shari doesn't even realize the impact she has on people's lives.  I don't think she really gets that she's saving lives, \"Crowell says.  \"It's amazing that because of one person's dream to help her son, many other people have benefited. And I'm grateful.\"If you would like to support Shari's mission, visit K9s for Warriors website to see how.  You can also learn more by visiting their Facebook and Twitter pages.

{"_id":"Abortion pills by mail studied in four states","articleText":"When the abortion pills arrived in her mailbox this summer, she felt anxious but also in control, knowing she could end her pregnancy entirely in the privacy of her own home.\"I was happy that I was going to be able to do it myself and I did not have a nurse there or doctors there staring at me and judging me,\" she said, asking to be identified only by her middle name, Marie, because she did not want people outside her immediate family to know about her abortion.Marie is part of a small but closely watched research effort to determine whether medical abortions -- those induced by medicine instead of surgery -- can be done safely through an online consultation with a doctor and drugs mailed to a woman's home.At a time when access to abortion is being restricted on many fronts, advocates say being able to terminate a pregnancy through telemedicine and mail-order drugs would provide a welcome new option for women. Opponents of abortion find the concept dangerous and deeply disturbing.The idea builds on a trend that is helping women obtain birth control more easily. A growing number of smartphone apps and websites now make it possible to get prescription contraceptives without visiting a doctor's office first. The pills Marie and the other women received through the study are not allowed for sale in pharmacies and are usually available only at hospitals and abortion clinics.Australia and the Canadian province of British Columbia allow women to get abortion pills by mail after consulting with a physician or other health care provider via phone or the internet. Several international organizations offer mail service in countries where abortion is otherwise unavailable or severely restricted. The oldest group, Women on Web, based in the Netherlands, has provided abortion medications to about 50,000 women in 130 countries since 2006. The service is not available in the United States, and the Food and Drug Administration warns against buying the drugs over the internet.Having the pills delivered to her home in Hawaii meant that Marie could avoid the cost and time of traveling by plane to the nearest abortion clinic, over 100 miles away in Honolulu or Maui. Once she received them, she set the package aside for a week in her bedroom, waiting until she could schedule time off from her job at McDonald's.The first pill, as expected, had little effect. The next morning, with her mother at her home to watch her toddler, she took the second. Almost immediately, the bleeding and cramping began. Within three hours, her eight-week pregnancy was over. She described the pain as a five on a 10-point scale. That night she cooked dinner for her family, and the next day she went back to work.The study Marie participated in is being conducted in four states -- Hawaii, New York, Oregon and Washington. It is being funded and organized by Gynuity Health Projects, a nonprofit research group focused on reproductive health services that seeks to improve women's access to medical abortions. The FDA has allowed the experiment. Women learn about it when contacting the abortion clinics in the study and other health providers who are aware of the trial and the website telabortion.org.Danco Laboratories, the company that makes the pills, has no plans to seek wider distribution of the medication either through mail-order pharmacies or physical pharmacies, a spokeswoman said. It would have to seek the FDA's permission to do so; the agency can also ask companies to change how their drugs are distributed.\"Abortion is a politically charged issue in this country, and there is an extra degree of caution,\" said the spokeswoman, Abby Long, explaining that research would be needed to support changing the drug's distribution.Of the first 12 women who participated in the study, all in Hawaii, 11 reported they had no complications and one did not take the pills, researchers said. Ten who completed surveys afterward said they were satisfied with the service and would recommend it to a friend, according to the researchers.\"It's absolutely an important step forward to expanding access to abortion that is safe and effective and creating options for women,\" said Susan Wood, director of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C. She was not involved in the study.Anti-abortion groups are outraged by the experiment.\"We have grave concerns about handing out dangerous, life-ending drugs without medical supervision because women face great risks for chemical abortions,\" said Kristi Hamrick, spokeswoman for Americans United for Life.Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, also raised safety concerns.\"If pills are sent through the mail, who are they supposed to call if they have a problem?\" she said.\"There are serious downsides from the pills,\" she said, adding, \"and just talking to someone over a computer and sending pills in the mail, to me, that is just reckless.\"The process does not allow women to avoid the doctor's office entirely. Using a video hookup on a home computer, a woman first consults with a doctor (or other clinician such as a nurse practitioner) at one of three participating abortion clinics who evaluates her medical history and explains how to take abortion pills and what to expect afterward. She must then get medical tests including ultrasound and bloodwork.If the tests show she is eligible for the study, the clinic sends her a package with pills and instructions via overnight mail. After taking them, she has some additional tests, such as an ultrasound to verify that the abortion is complete and also a phone consultation to review the results.Access to abortion has been declining steadily in the United States as dozens of clinics have been forced to close under new state restrictions. In Texas, the number of clinics fell to 18 in 2015 from 41 in 2012. Five states have just one clinic that offers abortions.Medical abortions require women to take two drugs that together induce a miscarriage. The first, mifepristone (marketed as Mifeprex), is typically taken in a doctor's office or clinic while the second, misoprostol, is given to the woman to take at home the next day.In the United States, the FDA has approved medical abortion pills for use only in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, while surgical abortions can be done later than that.Medical abortions make up a quarter of all abortions in the country. About 2.8 million women (PDF) in the United States have used mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy since the drug's approval in 2000, according to Danco Laboratories, its manufacturer.The American abortion study using overnight mail comes nearly a decade after Iowa became the first state to offer medical abortion counseling via telemedicine from a physician. But in Iowa and the three states that followed -- Alaska, Maine and Minnesota -- women must still go to a clinic that stocks mifepristone to receive the pills.If the study shows the telemedicine and mail approach works, that could encourage the FDA to stop restrictions on mifepristone, Gynuity's principal investigator, Dr. Elizabeth Raymond, said.\"All kinds of dangerous drugs are prescribed and available at pharmacies, including drugs for heart disease and Viagra,\" she said. \"There is no justification for why this safe drug should not be in pharmacies now.\"But even if the FDA were to lift its restriction on where abortion pills are dispensed, 19 states ban the use of telemedicine for abortion and require a physician to be physically present when consulting a woman, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.\"While this has the potential for being the future of abortion delivery for a good segment of the population, that vision might not be fulfilled due to the politics around the issue and restrictions in many states,\" said Jessica Arons, president and chief executive of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project in Washington, an advocacy group.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/health/abortion-by-mail/index.html"}

ISIS claimISIS claimed responsibility via a statement published by its media wing, Amaq news agency.The statement said that it targeted the Shia gathering in Kabul but did not disclose any information on the identity of the suicide bomber.The attack took place at 12:10 p.m. (2:40 a.m. ET) after a suicide attacker entered Shia mosque Baqir ul-Uloom as religious worshipers gathered to mark the Shia ceremony of Arbaeen, which comes 40 days after the major festival of Ashura.Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed in the year 680 AD. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid has denied the group is responsible for Monday's attack. 'Appalling' attack\"This appalling attack on worshipers is an atrocity,\" Pernille Kardel, the UN Secretary-General's deputy special representative for Afghanistan, said in a statement.\"UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan,\" said Kardel, who is also the acting head of the United Nations' mission in Afghanistan. \"Religious and ethnic tolerance are values the Afghan people hold strong, and I urge the Afghan authorities to do everything possible to defend Afghans of all faiths,\" she said. The US embassy in Kabul also condemned the attack, calling it a \"senseless and cowardly\" act.\"This attack is another demonstration of contempt for religious tolerance and communal harmony by the enemies of peace and progress in Afghanistan,\" the embassy said in a statement.Spate of violenceLast week a suicide attack near the Defense Ministry in Kabul killed four people and wounded 11, the latest in a series of attacks which have come around the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks and the beginning of the subsequent US \"war on terror.\"On November 11, four Americans were killed in an attack at Bagram Airfield. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that strike, praising the \"strong attack\" on Bagram Airfield in a tweet.In a statement, Mujahid said a suicide bomber had targeted \"a sports ground where more than 100 military officers, important people and soldiers were busy exercising.\"In the same week, a suicide attack targeting the German consulate in northern Balkh province killed four others.

{"_id":"After Aleppo falls, Syria's bloodshed may continue","articleText":"Haid Haid is a Syrian columnist and researcher focusing on security and conflict resolution. He is an associate fellow at Chatham House, working on the Middle East and North Africa Programme. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)The recent activity in Aleppo, which has seen Syrian government forces retake control of large parts of the city, confirms that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria. Only a widely accepted political settlement can end the fighting and stitch the country back together.The ongoing Syrian regime offensive -- supported by Russian and Iranian-backed forces -- to capture the rest of the eastern side of the city has led to the fall of one third of the besieged area. Although it is still not clear if and when the rest of the city will fall, the recent victories made by the Syrian regime and its allies have raised many questions about the impact of these gains on the conflict in Syria and the fate of the country.The internal divisions among rebel groups, their poor military performance and the lack of support channeled to them has led to speculation about the possibility of a military solution to the conflict in favor of the Syrian regime. These assumptions are likely jumping the gun: the regime controls less than a third of the country's territories. Restoring its grip on the rest of Syria faces huge challenges, both internally and externally.Will Aleppo fall?The fighting in Aleppo could last for a long time, which would be costly for everyone. Therefore, a deal might be reached to keep both the regime and rebel forces out of it.A small number of rebel fighters -- fewer than 1,000 -- were able to stop pro-regime forces from capturing the city of Daraya in rural Damascus for three years, despite all of the weapons used, including chemical attacks, airstrikes and starvation.The number of fighters in Aleppo is estimated to be around 8,000, which makes the chances of a swift victory less likely. Additionally, the majority of rebel groups in besieged Aleppo have recently merged together, which improves their ability to defend the city.\"The merger overcomes the divisions that allowed Assad to advance. Losing territories, which is bad in general, allows us to better defend the rest of our areas -- especially now that we have limited ammunition. Pro-regime forces will have to depend more on street fighting, which is in our favor because we know the area,\" said a fighter with the Aleppo's Army coalition on condition of anonymity.There is no indication that opposition backers will increase their support to rebel groups, however, recent reports indicate that Turkey is brokering a deal between rebel groups and Russia to find a deal to end the fighting in Aleppo. Although the details of this deal and its progress are still unclear, there are unconfirmed rumors that the deal will stop the offensive, keep the regime forces out of the area and allow locals to run their areas. In exchange, the rebels will have to leave the city.No end in sightDespite the significance of Aleppo, the fate of the city alone is not a decisive factor in the Syrian conflict. Even if the rest of Aleppo falls, it is likely that rebel fighters and civilians who wish to leave will be allowed to move to Idlib's province -- as has happened in similar cases -- where they will continue to resist the Syrian regime.The number of Syrian rebels estimated to still be fighting in the country is around 150,000. In addition, the regional powers, namely Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, are still invested in opposing Assad and remain actively against any solution that allows him to restore his power over the country.With the Syrian regime in control of so little of the country's territories, there is a long and a bloody road before it can claim any kind of victory. As a result, the armed conflict will last for a long time, even if it takes different formats.Ruling the country","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/opinions/syria-war-far-from-over-haid-opinion/index.html"}
{"_id":"After Fidel Castro's death, can Cuba finally move on?","articleText":" (CNN)Fidel Castro's death is the end of an era. He has gone not with a bang, as he arrived, nor with a whimper, but a simple fading away. Laid low by serious illness, his iron grip on the island nation had loosened over the past decade, with full power passing to his brother Raul in 2008.Castro's communist impulses were imprisoned by his increasing infirmity. In his failing years, he witnessed much of what he stood for slip away. Diplomatic relations with the US -- that 50 years ago had the world on the brink of nuclear war -- are on the mend. Whether he backed his brother in this detente is unclear; what is clear is that a quarter of a century after the collapse of their principal sponsor -- the Soviet Union -- neither of the brothers could stand in the way of their people's wishes any longer.Over the decades, plans were hatched to remove Castro by force if needed -- the CIA reputedly plotted to put explosives in one of the Cuban leader's favorite cigars. Despite the machinations, he survived to be a thorn in the side of every US administration.Obama's legacyA throwback to a bygone era of Communism that most of the world had forgotten, Cuba was less than 100 miles from the home of capitalism, America. This situation could not last.When President Obama came to office in 2009, Fidel had already seen off 10 of his predecessors, but it was Obama who was to help turn the course of Cuban history. He pledged to improve relations between the two countries. In April 2015, a handshake with Raul Castro in Panama signalled that one of Obama's foreign policy goals might be on track.A month later, Cuba was removed from the US list of \"State Sponsors of Terror\" and within a year, President Obama travelled to Cuba -- the first visit by a US President while in office in 88 years. Already relations between the two countries had been improving with the US allowing closer cooperation in telecommunications as the door to trade begun to creak open. Following the 1961 abortive CIA inspired \"Bay of Pigs\" coup attempt to topple Castro and the ensuing Cuban missile crisis -- when Castro invited the Soviet Union to base nuclear missiles on Cuba -- successive US administrations had used a twin strategy of diplomatic and economic isolation.Replacing Raul CastroDirect flights from the US to Cuba resumed in September this year, opening the doors to a potential influx of US Tourism dollars. Deeper trade ties may take a little longer: the US 1996 Helms Burton Act states that full economic links can not be restored until Cuba holds \"free and fair\" elections.Raul Castro has said that he will step down in 2018. How his replacement is selected will no doubt be a matter of close scrutiny, not just by the US Congress, but by the hundreds of thousands of Cuban diaspora.How that transition unfolds will be a reflection of Raul Castro's own rapprochement with the US. However, it currently feels less that he is opening the country up than the country and its people are beginning to burst free.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/americas/fidel-castro-cuba-future/index.html"}
{"_id":"After the revolution, Egyptian cinema plots comeback ","articleText":" (CNN)In 1896, several exclusive venues in Alexandria and Cairo hosted some of the earliest known screenings of the world's first movies, directed by the Lumiere Brothers. Egypt went on to establish a dominant position as the capital of the Arab film world. The \"Hollywood on the Nile\" enjoyed a sustained Golden Age in the mid-20th century, powered by the mighty Studio Misr and international stars such as Omar Sharif and Faten Hamama. But the glory days could not last, and the industry suffered a devastating blow with the 2011 revolution. Curfews were imposed that severely reduced cinema audiences, and production slowed to a crawl. The aftershocks continued with the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, and subsequent violence across the country. But after years of instability, there are signs that the Egyptian movie powerhouse is coming back to life. Green shoots?Earlier this year, romantic comedy \"Hepta\" demonstrated that audiences are returning to cinemas, breaking the box office record for the genre with takings in excess of $3 million.Egyptian films are also earning international critical acclaim. Mohamed Diab's \"Eshtebak\" (Clash), set entirely in a police van during the revolution, earned strong reviews at the Cannes Film Festival and is being tipped for an Oscar nomination. Filmmaker Amr Salama, who won several international awards for his groundbreaking portrayal of an AIDS patient in \"Asmaa\", believes the industry is flourishing. \"I believe there is a new wave in Egypt,\" Salama told CNN. \"There is a new type of film-making...and I am very proud if I can consider myself one of the talented directors that formed the wave.\"Egyptian cinema is recovering strongly, according to Sherif Mandour, producer and executive board member of the government's Chamber of Cinema. He claims that 40 feature films were made this year, which will rise above 60 in 2017, compared with just 20 in 2011.  \"After the revolution it was not secure to go to cinemas but now people are going again, and it is becoming a fruitful business,\" says Mandour. The official adds that the government has increased funding for film-makers from 20 million Egyptian Pounds ($1.11million) to 50 million ($2.77 million) per year, which will support increased production, with an emphasis on innovation.  Mandour acknowledges that rival Arab industries such as Morocco and Algeria have stolen a march on Egypt, but says it is a national priority to regain pre-eminence -- and points to a key advantage.\"Cinema was a huge part of our soft power over history,\" he says. \"It is not the same now and the competition is increasing, but Egypt has a space because we have the only language that is understood in all 22 Arab countries.\"Creative compromiseA growing number of Egyptian films are gaining critical or commercial success -- but rarely both. Hala Khalil's \"Nawara,\" the story of a downtrodden maid's experience of the revolution, scooped international prizes but mediocre returns at the box office. The director claims that studios have too much power and demand \"popcorn\" movies over more serious material. \"The big distributors and producers don't support our films because they say audiences don't like them,\" says Khalil. \"They talk badly about movies that are not action or comedy.\"\"We have a big industry but it is not for directors like me that make serious films. The producers and distributors control everything and they decide if your film succeeds or not.\" Censorship is another barrier, according to Khalil. \"There are three taboos; sex, religion and politics,\" she says. \"You have to be conservative as a director, and as my films deal with social issues it is difficult with those taboos.\"Directors must be creative to \"find an angle\" that will allow a controversial script to pass censors, says Khalil, such as setting an interfaith relationship in the past for her next movie. The nature of censorship is changing, according to critic Mohamed Andeel, which he believes reflects the government's hostility to the Islamist values of opponents the Muslim Brotherhood. \"I noticed a drop in the number of works that challenge the police or army, or talk about corruption,\" he says. \"At the same time there is a rise in TV shows and movies with drug or alcohol consumption.\"New frontierAndeel believes that Egyptian cinema is seeing individual successes rather than a movement. The current generation of film-makers lack the unity and purpose of the 1980s New Realists, according to the critic, or the grand resources of the 1950s Golden Age.But a new movement could emerge from a surprising source. Andeel is optimistic that a generation of internet amateurs, who can bypass the censors and the studios, will reshape the landscape. 'Encounter with death' by Alaa Assem\"The internet is encouraging so many people every day to become artists and create new forms of film-making,\" he says. \"Many Egyptians are doing it all the time and I'm fascinated by that.\"Andeel acknowledges that the work of internet directors typically lacks polish and resources. But with growing interest in this emerging field - including a new online film festival - he expects them to mature and flourish.\"I hope as more young people start making Vines and YouTube videos they become interested in making artwork with a slightly longer life,\" he says. \"I expect there will soon be a lot of film-making for the internet which will open completely new topics and challenge taboos.\"Egypt's next revolution may be underway.

It was the first time Wang had ever walked a runway and his flowing white beard certainly turned heads. He became an overnight Internet sensation in China, with some dubbing him \"China's Hottest Grandpa\" and \"Old Fresh Meat.\" \"Old Fresh Meat\" is a play on words for the popular Chinese phrase \"Little Fresh Meat,\" used to describe attractive, young TV stars.Chance discoveryAs one of China's top fashion designers, Hu Sheguang never had a grandfather in his mind when planning his catwalk for China Fashion Week 2015. But that all changed when he saw a photo of Wang in QQ Wang's mobile phone, the musician composing tracks for his show.  \"Who is this old man, looking so energetic?\" Hu asked.  \"That is my father,\" said the composer. Wang Deshun was quickly introduced to the designer and gladly took up a catwalk invitation. The rest is history.An actor by trade, Wang Deshun was born in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang in 1936 and started working in pantomime. He eventually moved into martial arts films, and has appeared in a number of Hollywood movies, including the \"Forbidden Kingdom.\" He first started going to the gym when he was 50, aiming to keep his body in shape for his acting career.  Seven years later, with a sculpted, lithe body, Wang created a performance called \"living sculpture.\" While used to attention, he is still a little taken aback by the extent his fame has grown so late in his career. \"People are surprised that an old man like me can have such good muscles,\" Wang tells CNN.  And don't expect him to be slowing down any time soon. \"Every day, for 30 years now, I have never stopped training,\" he says, noting that he almost never misses his rigorous daily swimming routine.  Milan Fashion Week plans In Wang's eye, age isn't an obstacle.  At 65, he learned to ride a horse in just a month for a role. At 78, he learned how to ride a motorbike.  The octogenarian has a different way of evaluating age.\"As long as you dare to do things you have never done before, your heart is still young,\" he says, adding that he believes people should think again when they tell themselves that it is too late to do something. \"That might just be your excuse for giving up.\" In a society where most people retire between 50 and 60 years of age, Wang Deshun is an anomaly, and plans to work as long as he is alive. Next year, he'll walk one of the runways at Milan Fashion Week. \"I don't have a plan,\" Wang says. \"I have always done whatever comes to my mind, and I will simply forge ahead.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/fashion/chinas-hottest-grandpa/index.html"}

On Monday, her mother posted an update saying the family was on the run.Syrian regime forces launched a long-threatened ground assault in Aleppo on Saturday, wresting control of a number of northeastern neighborhoods from rebels -- effectively driving a wedge through the eastern part of the city. Retaking eastern Aleppo would mark the biggest victory for the Syrian regime since the uprising began over five years ago.Bana's mother Fatemah told CNN their home took a direct hit on Sunday evening, forcing them into the street to wait for the planes to go and shelling to cease. Fatemah, 26, created the Twitter account for her daughter in late September to \"share our life here to the world'' as the Syrian army launched a major offensive to recapture Aleppo. \"Last message -- under heavy bombardments now, can't be alive anymore. When we die, keep talking for 200,000 still inside. BYE,\" Fatemah tweeted on Sunday night before posting a picture of her daughter Bana, who appeared to be covered in dust.The tweet references the estimated 200,000 civilians still living under siege in eastern Aleppo.The activist-run SMART News Agency said Sunday that airstrikes hit the al-Shaar neighborhood, where Bana's family live, injuring at least five people.Footage shared by SMART News Agency purported to show people in al-Shaar being carried away from the scene in the aftermath.Fatemah told CNN via Twitter direct message that her children -- Mohamed, 5, Noor, 3, and Bana -- were not injured in the strikes and they sought shelter in a nearby house later on Sunday evening.  Hundreds of civilians have fled Aleppo's rebel-held east since the assault this weekend. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the number of civilians fleeing the city was in the thousands.The Syrian army told state-run SANA news agency that its units had secured departure routes for 1,500 people from eastern Aleppo to regime-held areas on Sunday.On Monday, Bana tweeted asking for people's prayers amid fresh bombardments. Intense artillery fire by regime forces continued to target al-Shaar neighborhood on Monday, activists Aleppo Media Center reported. \"Under heavy bombardments now. In between death and life now, please keep praying for us,\" Bana said in a tweet.A local Aleppo activist said on Twitter that he did not know anything regarding the whereabouts of Bana and her family, but that \"their neighbourhood is being targeted heavily.\"A few hours later, Fatemah tweeted that the family was \"on the run.\"\"We are on the run as many people killed right now in heavy bombardments. We are fighting for our lives. Still with you,\" Fatemah added.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/middleeast/bana-aleppo-twitter-account/index.html"}
{"_id":"Aleppo: Eyewitness describes aftermath of hospital attack","articleText":" (CNN)In every corridor, every corner of the Omar Hospital in Aleppo, there are scenes of horror. Decapitated bodies on the hospital's floor, children with bloodied faces, screaming mothers searching for their families under the rubble -- these were some of images that one medic described to CNN after a hospital in eastern Aleppo was attacked Saturday. \"Whatever I say I will not be able to describe the horror I am seeing,\" Aref al-Aref, who filmed the aftermath of the shelling, said.On Sunday, Syrian regime forces pounded the rebel-held areas in and around the city of Aleppo with airstrikes and artillery shelling, according to Syria Civil Defense, killing 32 people and bringing the total death toll in a week-long bombardment campaign to over 300.Rescuers claim that hospitals in eastern Aleppo have been the primary target of the bombardment, which they describe as the most intense since the war began five years ago. Related: Aleppo pounded by 'heaviest bombardment' since war began As of Sunday evening, one hospital was functional in eastern Aleppo, scrambling with the influx of hundreds of injured, activists told CNN. They did not reveal its name or location over fears that it would be hit.\"People were in need of surgeries but there are no rooms to operate in,\" Al-Aref told CNN.\"A lot of people in need of hospitalization are having to stay at home because there is no space.\"Related: Syrian Expat Philharmonic Orchestra unites musiciansAleppo Media Center activists said that hospitals were running out of medicine and the civil defense was short of body bags and shrouds to wrap the corpses in.The shelling began last Tuesday after a three-week lull.'They are bombing our medical center'Speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, a doctor in Aleppo told of the terrible conditions for the injured, and of the continued bombing attacks in the east of the city.Dr Farida, who declined to give her last name to protect family living under government control, said the situation in eastern Aleppo was \"like a horror movie.\" \"You can't imagine a woman who is waiting, a beautiful baby is waiting, a beautiful thing, you come to the hospital and go out with injuries... and there is no incubator, there is no oxygen, no medical cast to help her. This is the situation,\" she said.Believed to be the last female obstetrician-gynecologist working in the rebel-held east, Farida wore a full vest and a surgical mask for her interview with CNN to conceal her identity. The constant bombardment of medical facilities means she is currently trying to find \"another basement or another underground place to work\" and delivering babies in apocalyptic conditions at a \"medical center\" where she says the maternal mortality ratio is sky-high. \"Sometimes the baby is injured inside the uterus. One day I delivered... the baby had injuries in his eyes,\" Farida said.  \"I'm so afraid. It's my home city. I'm so afraid that the fighters will surrender Aleppo to the regime,\" she said, adding that if the heavy bombing continued, that in one or two months \"we'll never see any human being living in Aleppo, we all will die.\" Then suddenly, she interrupted the interview and asked: \"Can you hear this? They are bombing now, our medical center.\"War crime warningUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the assault and \"indiscriminate shelling\" for killing and maiming scores of civilians, including children, and for leaving eastern Aleppo without functioning hospitals.\"The secretary-general reminds all parties to the conflict that targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure is a war crime,\" the statement said. \"Those responsible for these and other atrocities in Syria, whoever and wherever they are, must one day be brought to account.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/middleeast/syria-aleppo-hospital-horror/index.html"}
{"_id":"Aleppo: Who still lives in this decimated city -- and why? ","articleText":" (CNN)Imagine New York City getting annihilated by airstrikes. Or London being wiped off the map. Unless something changes soon, that's the fate awaiting Aleppo, Syria's massive economic and cultural hub. \"Between now and December, if we cannot find a solution, Aleppo will not be there anymore,\" UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said in October. Yet more than 1 million people remain, unsure when or where the next bomb will strike. Here's what their city looks like -- and why they're still there.What Aleppo looks like now Aleppo went from a bustling metropolis of more than 2 million people -- about the size of Houston -- to a devastated war zone in five years. Entire blocks of buildings are reduced to rubble. The city is about 70 square miles. That's almost twice the size of Paris.Control of the city is heavily fractured, split between the Syrian regime, rebels, Kurds and ISIS. The regime controls much of western Aleppo; rebels seeking to end President Bashar al-Assad's rule control much of the east. Who's still thereHundreds of thousands have fled Aleppo or died from the violence. But many remain -- and not necessarily by choice. About 1.5 million people live in regime-held parts of Aleppo, according to the United Nations. But the part most devastated by airstrikes, rebel-held eastern Aleppo, has about 250,000-275,000 residents who are trapped by government troops.There are \"no ways to get out of this city,\" said Abdulraham Almawwas, vice president of the White Helmets -- a civil defense volunteer group. \"It's completely under siege.\"Even those wounded in bombings face danger if they dare seek help. That's because eastern Aleppo hospitals have been pounded by airstrikes. \"There are no hospitals left operating in East Aleppo,\" the International Rescue Committee said Monday. \"In these conditions, (civilians) can expect any shelter to collapse on their heads at any moment.\"Aleppo hospital: Decapitated bodies on the floor, children's faces bloodiedLife in rebel-held Aleppo: 'It is horrifying' In the eastern neighborhood of Al-Shaar, Mohammed spends much of his day searching for food to feed his wife, mother and 2-year-old son. \"There is some bread in Aleppo, but you have to search well to find it,\" said the 29-year-old, whom CNN is not identifying for safety reasons. The government siege around rebel-held Aleppo has choked off the supply of food, fuel and other daily necessities. The regime has used this tactic -- dubbed \"Starve or Surrender\" -- before, including in the opposition stronghold of Homs. That city suffered mass starvation. Syrian children dying of hungerMohammed, the young father, says every day is a struggle for survival.\"Basically, my whole daylight is just me trying to find stuff,\" he said. And when he does find food, \"it is insanely expensive,\" describing prices 50 times higher than they were six years ago.Mohammed declined to describe his job, saying it would likely identify him. But he says business is almost nonexistent. \"Now I don't have any more work to do, so I am living on some savings,\" he said. The Aleppo native said he wishes he left before the government siege began.\"The regime has been bombarding the city over the last three years. It's very, very hard to live here,\" he said. \"The new (bunker-buster) missiles are horrible. I can't stand living here anymore. It is a nightmare.\"Why he stays: Mohammed said he doesn't have the money to leave. \"I can't afford to go to Turkey with my wife, son and mother. It would cost me around $8,000 -- at least -- just to get to Turkey,\" he said. \"And then I don't even have any idea what can happen next, and if I will be able to work.\"Mohammed said if he's able to escape, he'd like to go to a rebel-held part of the Aleppo countryside.  \"I don't trust the regime,\" he said. \"They would arrest me for sure.\" Life in regime-held Aleppo: 'We are being shelled regularly' Even parts of western Aleppo are under attack. Salam, a 35-year-old mother of two, says she has to tread carefully when walking her son to school. \"It is not safe. We are being shelled regularly by the opposition with mortars,\" said Salam, whom CNN is not identifying for safety reasons. \"When I take my kid to school, we try to walk under the balconies and try to stay away from open areas. We don't walk in open streets. And we try to reduce the time we spend out of our home as much as possible.\"Why she stays: Like Mohammed, Salam was born in Aleppo. But unlike Mohammed, she actually wants to stay. Salam is luckier than many of the residents living on the other side of Aleppo. She still has a workplace and job, teaching French at the same school her son attends. \"If the situation stayed like this security-wise, I think I will stay, because I don't want to live in a tent. Also, I don't want to be very poor and not be able to pay rent and bills,\" she said.\"We also don't want to lose the house. We worked for years to buy it.\" What the regime says Aleppo looks like  The Syrian regime recently released a tourism video promoting Aleppo. The panoramic views of government-held parts were accompanied by an acoustic version of the theme music to the HBO television series \"Game of Thrones.\" Some might find the \"Game of Thrones\" music an odd choice, since the show's fictional world of Westeros is a violent place engaged in its own bloody civil war.Aerial shots from the regime's video feature wide, green streets and swimming pools.It's not the only attempt to make Aleppo look appealing. In September, Syrian state-run media mocked the notion that Aleppo was one of the \"world's most dangerous\" cities, tweeting a video of locals enjoying the city's \"thriving nightlife.\"Trying to surviveWith much of eastern Aleppo reduced to rubble, some residents have found a way to turn debris into much-needed fuel. Locals discovered they can heat the plastic from broken chairs and pipes in a boiler and turn it into fuel, CNN affiliate RFE/RL'S Radio Farda reported. \"We can't explain it exactly, but if the waste plastic is from good material, the output of this process is gasoline,\" one man said. \"If the plastic quality isn't good, the end product is diesel.\"But that's just one temporary fix. If Aleppo doesn't survive past December -- as de Mistura portended could happen -- the crisis could get even more catastrophic. \"Civilians in Aleppo tell the IRC that they live in constant fear,\" the International Rescue Committee said. \"As they hear jets flying over their heads, they picture their homes getting hit at night, knowing there would be nothing they could do -- no way of running to safety or finding shelter.\"That's why Mohammed wishes he could leave, like the millions of refugees who have managed to escape. Mohammed said he's worried about his son, who has never lived a day without war. \"I want him to get out of this place as soon as we can.\"CNN's Schams Elwazer, Sean O'Key, AJ WIllingham and Donie O'Sullivan contributed to this report.

{"_id":"All aboard! The Chinese-funded railways linking East Africa","articleText":" (CNN)Near Africa's horn on the easternmost part of the continent, a shiny new electric railway runs alongside an old abandoned track through both arid desert and green highlands. Some 750 kilometres (466 miles) long, the $4 billion line opened in October and links landlocked Ethiopia to the coast in Djibouti.It was partly funded and built by Chinese companies, just like the other planned lines it could soon link up with neighboring Sudan and Kenya -- where the first part of a new $13 billion Kenyan railway linking Mombasa to Nairobi is taking shape.The sprawling network is planned to continue into South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, as part of transnational efforts to connect countries within East Africa.This could transform how goods and people move, and the increased number of lines is expected to boost trade in countries like Kenya, says Kuria Muchiru, advisory partner, East Africa, at PwC in Kenya.\"Because we probably have about 4,000 trucks everyday making the trip up from Mombasa into Nairobi, and some go farther on,\" adds Muchiru.The ports are where the magic happens, with 90% of African imports and exports conducted by sea which can be an issue for trade coming into landlocked countries.\"The new lines will have access to the ports and be able to almost offload directly onto the train and then straight onto inland locations,\" Muchiru says.Billions in loans The new lines are part of the so-called LAPPSET rail project and the EAC Rail Sector Enhancement Project, also called the East African Railway Masterplan, and managed by the East Africa Community (EAC) --  an intergovernmental organization run by Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda -- together with consulting company CPCS. But railways don't come cheap, and African countries are borrowing heavily from China to scrape the funds together.In the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014, African countries borrowed nearly $10 billion for railway projects from China, facilitated by the China Export Import Bank (Exim), according to researchers by SAIS China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS-CARI). Why does China invest so enthusiastically? China sees the railways as an investment opportunity which also creates an export market for their booming steel and construction industries, says Deborah Brautigam, professor of international political economy and director of SAIS-CARI.\"They have overcapacity in China. They have steel that they want to use. They've got experienced companies that know how to build railways.\"But it's not without risks, and whether the loans will be fully repaid remains to be seen, she adds.\"That's still a question mark.\"However, while countries often dream big, not all projects make it past the planning stage, according to Brautigam.Looking at larger projects, five railways have materialized so far, with the Tazara railway -- which links Tanzania and Zambia -- being the first to be completed back in the 1970s. The other four projects are in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Sudan, says Brautigam.The West not as keenThe US and other Western countries have financed some railways and other infrastructure projects across the continent, but they haven't been as keen to invest as China, partly due to a fear that the African countries won't keep up the maintenance, Brautigam says.\"[They] have put some money into these railways but not very much. They really haven't wanted to finance them.\"\"They felt, and probably rightly, that these governments were not doing a good job with what they had already,\" she adds.So are these new East African railway projects feasible? Andrew Grantham, editor at Railway Gazette International who covers railway developments in the area, says that as long as there are funds and political will, there are no technical hurdles to expect.\"The Chinese have built a railway to Tibet, and once you've done that, very few things are going to be a technical challenge.\" \"If you have the right environments, there is no reason these schemes shouldn't happen,\" he adds. While the old colonial lines vary in size and style, the new Chinese railways will be standardized, which makes it easier to link lines and countries, Grantham explains.\"Essentially, the Chinese will give you a catalogue. You pick one and build it.\" Is China building everything in Africa?It's not just railways. The Chinese are involved in constructing buildings, dams, and bridges within the continent. \"Fifty billion dollars a year of construction work is being done by Chinese companies in Africa. There's a huge range,\" Brautigam says.Between 2000 and 2011, the Chinese backed more than 1,700 projects in 50 African countries at a cost of  $75 billion, according to AidData.Controversial plansThe Chinese projects are not without controversy, however. Conservationists, for example, have voiced concern that they could disturb wildlife, as they cut through Kenya's national parks.China has also been criticized for working with undemocratic regimes and bringing their own workers, instead of employing locals.Dreams of a future Cape to Cairo lineNew plans could see the network extend even further south. Zambia sealed a deal with China this month which could link up Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique in four years time, according to Zambia's department of transport. However, travelers yearning for a trans-African Cape to Cairo railway may be disappointed. New railways are more likely to keep zigzagging from the coastal ports to mines and industrial districts inland, Grantham says.\"There has long been a dream of a Cape to Cairo railway, but the problem is that nobody actually needs to move any goods from Cape to Cairo, so realistically it's not a priority.\"  CNN's Katy Scott, Jason Kwok and Aaron Darveniza contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/africa/chinese-funded-railways-in-africa/index.html"}
{"_id":"Alt-right leader: 'Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!'","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The racism and anti-Semitism of the alt-right movement were on display Saturday in Washington when its members gathered to celebrate Donald Trump's victory. The president of the alt-right National Policy Institute Richard Spencer's remarks were posted Sunday on YouTube by \"Red Ice Radio,\" which describes itself as \"covering politics and social issues from a pro-European perspective.\" The Atlantic magazine, which is recording footage of Spencer for a documentary they're working on, also published a video of the same event showing audience members apparently giving the Nazi salute.\"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\" he declared. His remarks were filled with racist imagery -- including references to \"the black political machines\" and Latino housekeepers -- as he bashed Hillary Clinton's minority supporters. \"Her coalition was made up of mutually hostile tribes only united out of a hatred of 'whitey' -- that is to say, out of a hatred of us,\" Spencer said. He added that \"there are no two parts of this coalition who could ever be in the same room together for any length of time.\"\"America was, until this last generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. It is our creation and our inheritance, and it belongs to us,\" Spencer said. The event was held at the Northwest Washington restaurant Maggiano's which issued an apology Monday and told the Washington Post that it would donate $10,000 to the D.C. office of the Anti-Defamation League. Trump's transition team responded in a statement Monday saying Trump has \"continued to denounce racism.\"\"President-elect Trump has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American,\" Trump-Pence Transition spokesman Bryan Lanza said in a statement. \"To think otherwise is a complete misrepresentation of the movement that united Americans from all backgrounds.\"His comments came as Trump is under fire for tapping Steve Bannon, who was until recently the head of the alt-right Breitbart News, as his chief White House strategist, a position that does not require Senate approval. Bannon has said he rejects the racist and anti-Semitic elements of the alt-right and described himself as an \"economic nationalist.\" Spencer bashed journalists covering the 2016 presidential election, too. \"One wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem,\" Spencer said in a reference to a Jewish fable in a portion of his speech dedicated to criticizing both the media and Jews. He also used a Nazi-era propaganda term meaning \"lying press\" to describe reporters, citing \"the mainstream media -- or perhaps we should refer to them in the original German, lugenpresse.\" And he tempered his praise the Republican President-elect. Even Trump, Spencer warned the white supremacist audience, has taken positions that are in his view too friendly to minorities and Jewish people. He said Trump has supported affirmative action and opposed segregated establishments. On immigration, Spencer said, Trump \"left the door open to some kind of mass amnesty at a future date, talking about keeping the 'good ones' in the country.\" And, he said, Trump \"will be perhaps the most pro-Zionist president ever put in office,\" citing his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, \"which we should admit wasn't actually that bad.\"The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum put out a statement on the dinner saying it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the gathering \"just blocks from the Museum.\"\"The Holocaust did not begin with killing; it began with words. The Museum calls on all American citizens, our religious and civic leaders, and the leadership of all branches of the government to confront racist thinking and divisive hateful speech.\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/alt-right-gathering-donald-trump/index.html"}

{"_id":"Americans share their greatest fears","articleText":" (CNN)Photographer Mike Belleme says that in the last few years, he has noticed a greater sense of fear throughout the United States.And our fears, he says, have polarized us.\"I think a lot of the reason for that is just a lack of connecting to the sense of other, someone who's different from you, and a lack of understanding and empathy toward people in different experiences,\" he said.It's those observations that led Belleme to document this subject in an in-depth manner. For every portrait in his series \"States of Fear,\" he asks the person he's photographing a simple question: What is your greatest fear or concern?He chose the words \"fear\" and \"concern\" specifically. Fear, he says, makes people look inward, where they think about themselves and how they feel. Concern makes people look outward, as it is something people usually have for others -- like concern for their family and friends or concern for their community and country. \"Using conversations about fear to create empathy is kind of the antidote for me,\" Belleme said. \"It's trying to challenge myself to question my own stereotypes and preconceived notions and biases.\"By challenging himself, Belleme hopes to challenge the viewer of his images as well, to encourage them to come along with him on this journey and question their own ways of thinking about people who may seem so different than they are. He says there are a lot of gaps in our country that need to be bridged -- whether economic, religious, racial, political -- and he hopes to create a sense of connectedness in a seemingly disconnected climate.\"The polarized nature of the country right now is more of the topic of the project,\" Belleme said. \"And that's really what I'm addressing more so than the fear. I'm using fear as a way to address this.\"Fear can be a unifier -- in both positive and negative ways -- and what Belleme has been doing throughout this work is trying to find the parallels between people based on their fears and concerns. \"It creates a more complex view of our population, where it's not just like you've got everyone over here versus everyone over here,\" he said. \"All of a sudden, as I'm tying people together through their fears, I'm seeing that they have a lot of similarities in the things they fear and their human struggle.\"Chris Valetin, for instance, is 62 years old and fears ISIS and the America that the next generation will live in. And Mohammed Quraishi, who is just 21 and is perhaps considered the next generation, fears extremists harming his siblings in Iraq.There's also Peggy May, 46, who lives in Lewiston, Maine. After three marriages and four children, she came out as a gay woman about five years ago, and she fears discrimination and hate crimes. She also touched on some other aspects of her city that scare her, such as immigrants and people's lack of understanding for her culture.Fatuma Hussein, 39, lives in the same city as May. Lewiston has a large Somali population, as a number of refugees and asylum seekers from Somalia have resettled in the United States. Hussein's family is Somali, and all her children are American-born. Although she's lived in the United States her whole life, she fears never having a place to belong.Belleme says he had a lot of moments where, while he was talking to one person, he would realize how their story connected to someone else's. He also met people who surprised him.\"You think you know what they're going to say, kind of, and you think you have some sense of expectation of whom they're going to be, and that's a really hard thing to turn off in your brain,\" he said. \"We're not as perceptive as we think we are. We think we know people. We think we can figure people out really quickly.\"Someone that especially surprised Belleme was a San Francisco woman named Teal Brown Zimring. She told him about her struggles with bipolar disorder, and she opened up about her difficulties being raised by a bipolar mother.\"To me, when I first met her, she had this very professional persona, and me, I'm like a country boy, I live in the woods in North Carolina,\" Belleme said. \"She got very, very vulnerable with me, which is not something I expected from her in those first interactions. Which made me feel terrible because I had made that judgment and I was so wrong. She ended up being one of the most real and genuine people that I met in the entire, almost year, that I've been working on this.\"It's portraits such as Zimring's that challenged Belleme the most. And he says that's only a good thing.\"The photos that are really for you are the ones that challenge you,\" he said. \"That's the purpose of the project, is to challenge people: challenge their stereotypes, challenge their ideas of thinking of human beings. The powerful ones for me are the ones where, I had an idea coming into this who they were going to be, and they shattered that idea.\"So far, Belleme has photographed about 75-80 people in 11 states. He says a few fears were repeated a lot, including the fear of terrorism and, more recently, the fear of another world war. But there are also people like World War II veteran and artist Irwin Tuttle, who told Belleme he fears nothing. \"The deeper you go with someone, the more you realize that you probably don't have all the information,\" he said. \"When you really hear the whole story, completely hear them out, you can completely understand why they feel the way they feel.\"Mike Belleme is a photographer based in Asheville, North Carolina. His biggest fear is not achieving his career goals. You can follow him on Instagram and Facebook.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/us/cnnphotos-fear-portraits/index.html"}

I did pick up a hotel a couple times month to shower and clean up a bit.\"Snakebites and poison oakAlong the way, he got poison oak in California, impetigo in Georgia and snake bites in South Dakota and Louisiana. Hancock was forced to climb a tree in Montana to avoid a moose, ran into a white wolf in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and was stalked by a mountain lion for three days in Oregon.\"That really sucks when you can see it follow you down the road,\" he said.He endured all of this for three reasons, he said. He did it for self-healing, to visit fellow Marines and Gold Star families of the fallen -- and to spread awareness about what it's like for a war fighter to come home.\"I had to lay myself on the altar of humility,\" Hancock said. \"I wanted to show my brothers that it's okay to feel those feelings of darkness. And it's really okay to talk about them. That's such a higher purpose and transcends more than just my unit.\"Hancock fought with the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment -- nicknamed The Magnificent Bastards -- in the first Battle of Ramadi in 2004. The unit suffered the highest casualty rate in the Iraq War out of any single infantry battalion with 20% of the entire 1,000-man force killed or wounded, according to the U.S. Marine Corps. For many the battle hasn't ended. Hancock's marathon trek to honor their continuing struggle now is being turned into a documentary called \"Bastard's Road.\"Healing deep woundsHancock says 25-30% of his unit endures post-traumatic stress disorder and at least seven have committed suicide. \"Not a man from Ramadi comes home and doesn't feel something,\" he said.Hancock hopes his walk and his brotherhood can help heal some very deep wounds.\"There's been tears and there's been lots of hugs and reassurances that we're gonna be there for each other,\" Hancock said. \"You speak about bad things and the memories that you hold dear to yourself and things you don't share with your families. So you share them with each other.\" Hancock also knocked on the doors of Gold Star families.\"Their sons never came home and so to see a man who knew their sons or knew of their sons,\" Hancock said, \"I imagine that they would see their son walking home. It was tough for them and it was tough for me because you have to share in that emotion and grief. \"I wondered if I was strong enough to take that feeling on -- over the course of time, I realized that I was and I should continue to do this.\"Now, almost 6,000 miles later, with feet that look like a \"prehistoric river bed,\" Hancock's walk is nearing an end. On December 12, he'll walk into Camp Pendleton in southern California. This time he'll be far from alone. Many brothers in arms from his old battalion will be there to guide him through the gates.They'll do so knowing that the United States is again in combat in Iraq. American troops are helping Iraqi coalition forces battle ISIS to recapture cities Hancock and his comrades fought for more than a decade ago.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/iraq-veteran-marine-walk-trnd/index.html"}

{"_id":"An island's future tied to farming crops from the past","articleText":" (CNN)Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents -- all descendants of slaves.Sapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.This remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.\"I'm what you refer to as a 'beenhere,' \" joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. \"It means I've always been here.\" Bailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income. In an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents' gardens for centuries.\"We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more ... so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,\" Bailey said.A pea with historyBailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.\"To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,\" Thomas said, \"and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.\"He says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. \"They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.\"     Now in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.A large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland's Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon's family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.Today, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges. \"I'm really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,\" Dixon said. \"My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.\"Preserving Geechee foodways Dixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.  \"Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,\" he said. \"You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.\" Heirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options. Sapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. \"However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,\" Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. \"By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.\"Dixon admits that farming heirloom crops requires attention to detail. Using farm machinery from the past is an important when working with heirloom plants. Georgia Costal Gourmet Farms is also working toward organic certification. According to the USDA, there is a three-year process to transition farmland to organic standards.  Dixon believes in offering a quality product. \"With food, the way it is today, growing crops the way our ancestors used to will make us a better community. And they will continue to tell the story of the places and people that helped preserved them. \"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/sapelo-island-red-peas/index.html"}
{"_id":"Andy Warhol's infamous Factory through the eyes of a teenage photographer","articleText":"American photographer Stephen Shore was only 17 when he was invited to Andy Warhol's Factory to take a few pictures. He ended up staying for two years. This is an abridged excerpt from \"Factory: Andy Warhol\" (Phaidon), his new book about the experience. (CNN)Andy would work all the time. There'd be some people helping him, like Gerard Malanga, who would be actively involved in silk-screening whatever the project was. There'd be other people who would just come and hang out. I remember being very impressed, or unfavorably impressed, with some of these people who'd sit on a chair or couch, sit there for hours, doing nothing, waiting for the evening when we went to parties. I'd be taking pictures. But the people just hanging out would bother Andy. Every now and then, there would be a sign by the elevator, so when you entered you would see it, \"If you have no business to conduct here, please don't come.\" Andy would never enforce it. Read: 'People call me the man who shot the '70s'My guess is that it helped him in his work to have people around, to have these other activities around him. I think he kept people involved by asking, \"What do you think of this? Oh, I don't know what color to use. What color should I use?\" Just something to keep the swirl of activity around him.The private side of Andy WarholI was the only person of the people who were hanging out with him, or one of the few, who lived uptown. Often we would wind up, say, in Chinatown at 2 a.m. and share a cab home. We'd have conversations. He was very open and unaffected.He would say things he wouldn't have said in a more public situation. One time Andy asked me if I had seen some film on \"The Late, Late Show\" the previous night. (I forget the film, but Priscilla Lane was in it. A 1930s tearjerker.) And, in fact, I had. Read: Before Instagram, there was WarholAndy wanted to know what the ending was, because he said he started crying and fell asleep. Then he said, \"And the television was off in the morning, so I guess my mother must have come in and turned it off.\" I remember, at the time, finding it stunning and poignant that he's Andy Warhol, who's just come from some all-night party or several of them, and has turned on the television and cried himself to sleep to a Priscilla Lane film, and his mother had come in and turned it off.An unexpected education I'd been doing photography for a long time by that point, but I had always done it in an untutored way. For reasons of my youth, and reasons of the lack of intensity of critical discourse around photography at that time, I think I was still very naive. I saw Andy making aesthetic decisions; it wasn't anything he ever said to me. I saw these decisions happening over and over again. It awakened my sense of aesthetic thought. It had to do more with the framework that the work was seen in. Like the nature of serial imagery, which his work deals with, obviously. I began to think about it and was involved, to some extent, in a little way. More in sequence than seriality. Read: Lose yourself in the dreamy, intimate portraits of Shen WeiI think I learned by observing -- not observing him in order to learn, just by being exposed to the decisions and the actions he was making. More basic was simply a transition to thinking aesthetically. By the end of my stay at the Factory, I found that just my contact with, and observation of, Andy led me to think differently about my function as an artist. I became more aware of what I was doing.\"Factory: Andy Warhol\" by Stephen Shore, published by Phaidon, is out now.

{"_id":"Angela Merkel calls for full-face veil ban in Germany ","articleText":" (CNN)German chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a ban on full-face veils in the country, during a speech at her party's conference on Tuesday. \"The full veil is not appropriate here, it should be forbidden wherever that is legally possible. It does not belong to us,\" she said at the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) gathering. Her comments were met with sustained applause by the audience.It's not the first time party leaders have proposed banning the Islamic dress, with Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also calling for the veil to barred from public places in August.\"It does not fit into our society for us, for our communication, for our cohesion in the society.... This is why we demand you show your face,\" he said at the time.A fourth term for Merkel?Merkel's comments come weeks after she announced she would be seeking a fourth term in next year's elections.The 62-year-old chancellor said she expected the 2017 campaign to be her toughest to date.Merkel has angered many voters with her decision to open Germany's borders to migrants, mostly from war zones in the Middle East. In September, her party suffered a significant defeat in local elections. OPINION: Is Merkel paying the price for the refugee crisis?Another stint for Merkel would also be significant because a large part of the German electorate is looking for stability in uncertain times after the Brexit vote in Britain, the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the rise of populist movements in several European countries.French precedentGermany's proposal follows similar bans in France, Belgium and Switzerland.Cannes, a city on the French Riviera famous for its annual film festival, temporarily banned religious swimwear -- including burkinis -- in the wake of recent terror attacks in the country.The bans were later overturned in court. In April 2011, France also became the first European country to ban wearing the burqa, a full-body covering that includes mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes, in public.Those breaking the law face fines of 150 euros (about $205) or public service duties.The law was upheld by the European Convention on Human Rights in 2014 after a 24-year-old woman brought the case to court, claiming it infringed on her religious freedom.The laws have been criticized by religious freedom advocates but supported by others who see the Islamic veil as demeaning to women and inconsistent with France's rigorously enforced secularism.CNN's Stephanie Halasz and  Chandrika Narayan contributed to this report ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/europe/angela-merkel-full-veil-ban-germany/index.html"}

{"_id":"Anthony Bourdain: 'We gave it everything we had'","articleText":" (CNN)Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubbleAncient footprints are everywhere.You can almost think that you're seeing double,On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room,Where I got me a date with a pretty little girl from Greece,She promised she'd be there with me,When I paint my masterpiece-- Bob DylanYou should know right now, if you didn't know already, that what drives the team behind \"Parts Unknown\" is not to do what we did last week or last month -- or ever. We are delighted when our viewers like an episode and even more delighted when they love one. But we are compelled, just the same, to avoid repeating what we've done before. If we fail -- we want to fail outrageously, foolishly, gloriously -- giving it everything we've got in the cause of making something new and strange and hopefully, awesome. Our latest Rome episode is, perhaps, the most ambitious example of that compulsion. My longtime team has for years discussed the possibility of shooting an episode entirely in wide screen, letterbox anamorphic format -- like so many of the movies we admire. And for this episode, we finally got our way. This was necessarily a mammoth undertaking. Networks don't like it -- as it makes distribution to countries where they might still have square TV sets difficult. To do it right requires additional equipment, lighting, expense -- and, in this case, the addition of a sizable Italian film crew. Working within the Italian filmmaking system presents ... challenges of its own. The kinds of images we anticipated capturing required music adequate to the scale and subject. Which meant we needed an actual score -- in this case, a beautiful collection of related pieces on a theme by our longtime music director Michael Ruffino. And I was adamant about acquiring rights to an existing piece of music -- the song \"Spiral Waltz\" from the wonderful 60's sci-fi satire, \"The 10th Victim\". And though we intended from the beginning to make the most beautiful looking show we had ever done, there was one important thematic constraint: We would shoot NO classical Rome. The entire episode would feature ONLY the architecture of Mussolini and post-Mussolini era Rome: brutalist, futurist and rationalist structures, mid-century housing blocks, suburbs, the decidedly downscale and not particularly romantic seaside community of Ostia.Rome may be the most romantic city in the world, and one of the most filmed, but the films we chose to reference were films by Pier Paolo Pasolini,  Dario Argento and Abel Ferrara. Pasolini's wonderful, heartbreaking \"Mamma Roma\" is kind of a continuing reference point. And visually, Bernardo Bertolucci's  \"The Conformist,\" of course -- a film I've been besotted with for years. What's it about? Well ... it's complicated. A lot of stuff. It's about everyday Rome, the joys and the frustrations. It's about fascism -- and how it might have happened in this most beautiful of cities. It's about movies. It's about love -- for films, for places, for the little things that make our lives bearable and for people. Near the end, the brilliant and always honest Asia Argento says, \"So you're saying there's a little fascist inside you?\" Yes. Thinking about it now, I am saying that. And to some extent, that's what this episode is about: the urge, the impulse, for ordinary people, even ones surrounded by beauty, to want a leader, a man on a horse, to come down from on high and make everything better. Someone/anyone who will say with a firm voice, \"Listen to me! I know what I'm doing!\"That things have historically seldom if ever worked out in the wake of such promises is almost beside the point. The episode would not have been possible -- or be anything like it is without the truly magnificent Asia Argento. She's spent a lifetime in films -- mostly in front of the cameras, but also -- and quite notably -- behind, directing most recently the remarkable and beautiful \"Incompresa (Misunderstood).\" She told us about \"stornaro,\" the bawdy, profane Roman folk songs we feature at various times during the episode. She introduced us to the batshit crazy boxing club where we ate pasta ringside as gladiators pounded one another and the crowd hooted and roared. She allowed us to shoot at her favorite little restaurants, where she takes her kids on the weekends for homemade fettuccine and polpetti. Introduced us to the lovely and outrageous trans ladies who live in her neighborhood -- and arranged for them to wander, choreographed, like exotic birds, through her local Quicky Mart while we shopped for dinner. Italy's 20 regions, dish by delicious dishShe arranged for her sister Fiore to cook for me at her home -- with her delightful children, daughter Ana and son Nicola (who pretty much steals the show as he struggles with his tripe). She convinced the notorious Abel Ferrara to appear in the episode -- and explain how the maddest and baddest of American film directors could find himself living an ordinary life as a husband and father in Rome.But most importantly, she was herself. Always honest, completely unsparing. If you ask Asia a question, you are going to get an answer -- and she doesn't care if it reflects badly on you -- or on herself. She's going to give it to you straight. Actors and film people are generally a frightened bunch. They fear saying or doing the wrong thing -- of somehow finding themselves no longer able to work in film. Though she was born into a film dynasty and has been acting since she was 9 years old, Asia has never given a fuck. Her admission that she never votes is both terrible and true -- and about as close to home as it gets. The last word, appropriately, is hers.It's a very beautiful show. The most beautiful we've ever made, I think. And I'm very proud of the work that cinematographers Zach Zamboni and Todd Liebler put into it. Director Tom Vitale put heart and soul into the effort -- enduring many agonies during the process. Producer Jeff Allen somehow managed logistical and diplomatic challenges that would have killed a lesser man. And editor Hunter Gross just gets better and better. We gave it everything we had.

{"_id":"Aquafaba: The trendy ingredient that might change how you cook","articleText":"The next time you open a can of chickpeas, don't pour the liquid down the drain—stash it in your fridge. That fluid, known as aquafaba, has become quite a sensation online. That's because it can be used as a vegan alternative to dairy and eggs in everything from meringue to mayonnaise. If you're curious about this new trend but want some more info before trying it, here are five things you should know about aquafaba.There are two ways to get itAquafaba can be the water you used to boil bagged pulses (lentils, beans, and peas, like chickpeas), or it can be the liquid from canned versions of these foods. It seems to work best when it's derived from beans or chickpeas. With a little whipping, the liquid develops a fluffy texture that resembles whipped egg whites, whipped cream, or milk foam.RELATED: Switching to a Vegan Diet? 12 Things You Need to KnowIt's a brand new trendUnlike quinoa or kale, aquafaba isn't a food that's been around for decades and suddenly became hot. According to Aquafaba.com, the story starts with a French cook named Joël Roessel, who began experimenting with the liquid from canned goods in search of an egg alternative in 2014, and wrote about his results on his blog. In February of 2015, two French scientists posted a video on YouTube in which they whip the liquid from canned chickpeas into a foam, and made chocolate mouse. An American engineer named Goose Wohlt was inspired by their video and discovered the liquid could be used in place of eggs to create a vegan meringue, reports The New York Times. Wohlt posted his findings in a Facebook group and with the help of an excited vegan community, coined the liquid aquafaba, a combination of the Latin words for \"water\" and \"beans.\" The trend took off from there—big time.Nutrition info is limitedBecause aquafaba is so new, its nutrition analysis isn't readily available. I can only find one source to date: Aquafaba.com, which raised funds to have the liquid tested by a lab. The analysis found that a chickpea-derived aquafaba contains about 3 to 5 calories per tablespoon, but is not a significant source of carbs, protein, fat, vitamins, or minerals. Further research may reveal antioxidants, B vitamins, or other beneficial compounds that weren't included in the initial analysis. But for now, the biggest benefits of aquafaba are that it's plant-based, naturally gluten-free, low in calories, and can mimic the consistency of ingredients like eggs and dairy for those who choose or need to avoid them.RELATED: Delicious Vegan Recipes You'll probably need a sturdy mixerMost of the videos and recipes online use a KitchenAid mixer with a balloon whisk. A hand mixer is another option, although it will generally take longer, and you likely won't achieve the same consistency as a stand mixer. While blenders typically won't work because the speed of the blades destroys the foam, some online posts claim to have made aquafaba by vigorously shaking the liquid in a sealed jar.RELATED: What the Heck is Nooch and Why Is Everyone Talking About It? Simple ways to use itEarlier this year I had the pleasure of watching a chef from the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone create a simple yet delicious chocolate mousse, starring aquafaba and melted dark chocolate. Another easy option is \"ice cream\" typically made with aquafaba, frozen fruit, and honey. But you'll find dozens upon dozens of recipes online. I recommend using these three rules of thumb: 1) Look for pulses that don't contain added salt, especially if you're using a larger amount of liquid. 2) Keep added sugar to a minimum, and use natural or less processed options. 3) Choose recipes packed with superfood ingredients, including fruit, fresh herbs and spices, dark chocolate, nuts, and seeds.RELATED: 3 Hearty Vegan Recipes Even Meat Eaters Will Love The process of making aquafaba is pretty cool, so if you haven't tried it yet, give it a go, have fun, and keep it healthy.

{"_id":"Architecture of the afterlife: This is how you design for the dead","articleText":" (CNN)Crematoriums, morgues, funeral homes. These buildings, all of which are involved in rituals around death, often look as mournful as they sound.Designed to be discreet, they are usually cold and depressing utilitarian concrete boxes, tucked far away from the land of the living. But architects around the world have begun to embrace death, designing symbolic structures that exude beauty, peace and a sense of intrigue. \"Crematoriums and morgues, including modern architecture, have always been challenging topics for architects,\" says German designer Nikolaus Hirsch, who recent helped design a museum for the dead.\"But architecture can build a bridge between the living and the dead and, to some extent, blur the boundaries.\"From a Museum of Immortality in Mexico to a poetic morgue in Spain, designers are on a mission to inject more life into architecture for the dead.Immortality by designIt was the connection between the living and the dead that inspired Hirsh's thinking behind the \"Museum of Immortality.\"Commissioned by Design Week Mexico and the Museo Tamayo for their October 2016 exhibition, the conceptual pavilion aims to stretch the field of design beyond tangible objects. Hirsch, who created the museum with his colleague Michel Müller from Studio MC, described it as an abstract attempt to offer immortality to humans, much like a museum's approach to objects. Floating cemeteries and space burials: Asia's futuristic take on death\"It's inspired by a two-fold conversation: the preservation of objects in a museum and the preservation of humans in mausoleums,\" he says.The concept pays homage to 19th century Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov and his notion of the 'Common Task' -- a philosophy that explores resurrecting the dead through science and technology. Indeed, Hirsch and Müller's abstract interpretation brings to mind other-wordly pursuits. The 26 foot tall, hexagonal pavilion resembles a cross between a spaceship and a crypt, and was built using 15 layers of stacked acrylic boxes -- some transparent and some opaque.Each box is roughly the size of a human: about 5 feet, 11 inches long and just under 2 feet wide.The futuristic appearance is also a nod to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the world's largest operational space launch facility, while the curving shape takes inspiration from the country's geometric mausoleums.Currently located in the Parque Bosque de Chapultepec outside the Museo Tamayo, in Mexico City, the free-standing structure will be on display until spring of 2017.New ideas in New DelhiMexico isn't the only place where architecture is rethinking death. In New Delhi, 24-year-old Sanchit Arora, of Renesa Architecture Design Interiors Studio, has proposed a new approach to traditionally gloomy crematoriums. Following in-depth research, that included his own grieving process, Arora found that the city's public crematorium facilities are often poorly managed, run-down and located in dilapidated industrial areas. Now in discussion with the New Delhi government, Arora is pushing for a more welcoming and nature-inspired crematorium zone in a South Delhi park that would alter the mourning experience completely. \"When my grandmother passed away, we saw the sad situation of crematoriums in New Delhi. They are left dirty and uncared for, and it's just a sad state of affairs,\" he says. \"It just adds to your psychological distress during an already upsetting time.\"As cremation is a key part of a Hindu funeral, Arora set out to design a systematic yet approachable space that aims to soothe the living while they mourn the dead.\"What we saw through the process of my grandmother's death is that, in the end, it's not about the body. It's about the people who are coming to mourn,\" says Arora.\"When people die of old age in India, it is supposed to be a celebration. But there is a disconnect between the space and the celebration.\" With exposed concrete, warm woods, and lush greenery all around, Arora's design creates a minimalistic, zen vibe. There are quiet nooks and peaceful water features -- all connected to a spacious park.  In Hindu culture, a funeral consists of several parts -- it begins by viewing the deceased at home and is followed by bathing the body to purify sins. The body is then moved onto a wooden funeral pyre to be cremated.Arora's design not only introduces more environmentally-friendly electric cremation, it also streamlines each step of the process, with a logical path through the premises that offers organization and intimacy during the funeral process.\"Death is always going to be death,\" says Arora. \"But the translation of those spaces in terms of architecture and design changes from culture to culture.'Peaceful passing in SpainAcross the other side of the world, on the outskirts of Zaragoza in Spain's northeastern Aragon region, Tanatorium looks more like a spa than a morgue.Designed by Juan Carlos Salas, the award-winning building has a sculptural appearance and every detail carries meaning. \"We tried to find the soul of the space,\" explains Salas. \"The plan of the building symbolizes a cavern. Visitors contemplate the deceased and explore their inner lives at the same time.\"Using a stereotomic architecture technique of cutting stones to form a perforated envelope, Salas created a cavernous atmosphere that's meant to offer a sense of protection.

{"_id":"Arizona rejects recreational marijuana, three states OK it","articleText":" (CNN)Voters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada have decided that marijuana should be legal to use recreationally, CNN projects. Arizona has rejected its recreational marijuana proposition.On election day, voters in five states were asked to decide whether the recreational use of marijuana should be legalized and so far, three have said yes, while one said no. Official results have yet to come in for Maine, where the battle remains too close to call just yet.Four other states voted on whether marijuana should be used for medical reasons. Residents in Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota voted yes, according to their election results websites. Residents in Montana voted to lift provider restrictions. Medical marijuana is now legal in more than half of US states.  The number of adults who have smoked weed has nearly doubled in three years, according to a Gallup poll released in August. It is the No. 1 illicit drug of choice for Americans, according to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use, although only one-third of users reported an addiction to the substance, unlike most all the other illicit drugs used. Prior to the vote, it was legal to use recreational marijuana in only four states and in the District of Columbia. Colorado and Washington state voted to OK it in 2012. Alaska and Oregon voters approved it in 2014. For the states where recreational use is legal, it seems to have been a boost to the economy. The marijuana industry created more than 18,000 full-time jobs last year and generated $2.39 billion in economic activity in Colorado, according to an analysis from the Marijuana Policy Group.   There have also been some health consequences. Emergency rooms have seen a significant increase in adult marijuana-related exposure cases. The number of calls to poison control centers involving Colorado children has gone up, as has the number of children who've been taken to the hospital for treatment due to unintentional marijuana exposure, studies show. There have also been more school suspensions, marijuana-related traffic deaths, pet poisonings and lab explosions.Here's what was chosen at the polls.California: ApprovedThe people of California voted to make the recreational use of marijuana legal.Being the country's most populous state and the world's sixth-largest economy, the decision could have the biggest impact on the national scene. In 1996, the state was the first to make medical marijuana legal.The \"yes\" on Proposition 64 will now make it legal for people 21 or older to use it recreationally. There would be a 15% sales tax, and its cultivation will be taxed. The money will be used in part to study drug research, to study treatment and to help with enforcement of the law.The state's two largest newspapers backed the measure, as did the California Democratic Party, while Republicans were against it. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the Los Angeles Times on Friday that she planned to vote in favor of it. That makes Pelosi the highest-ranking, sitting elected official in either political party to support legalizing a drug the federal government currently considers a Schedule 1 narcotic. A Schedule 1 narcotic is a drug with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. The category also includes heroin.Massachusetts: ApprovedMassachusetts also voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.Massachusetts already had some marijuana-friendly laws in place before the decision. Medical marijuana became legal in 2012, and a 2008 ballot measure replaced criminal penalties with civil penalties on adults who possess an ounce or less.Question 4, as the recreational use measure is called, will legalize it and allow the commonwealth to tax and regulate its use and sale, much like the way alcohol is handled. That means people 21 and older could use it, possess it or grow it. They can have under 10 ounces in their home and under 1 ounce in public and be allowed to grow six plants. A number of politicians there support it, as does the American Civil Liberties Union. Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, opposed legalization, as did Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat. Baker argued that passage would exacerbate the state's opioid epidemic. Roman Catholic bishops in Massachusetts also argued against legalization, saying it is \"not a path civil society should chose to take.\" The Boston Globe wrote in support of the ballot measure, arguing, \"legal marijuana is coming. Let's get on with it.\" Maine: Awaiting result In Maine, a \"yes\" on Question 1, would make it legal for a person 21 or older to use marijuana. For now, the result remains too close to call.The state will also put a 10% sales tax on the drug and allow social clubs and retail groups to sell it.Maine legalized medical use of marijuana in 1999. Previous attempts to legalize it for recreational purposes were unsuccessful.The law will allow people to use it in a nonpublic space or in a private residence and institute a sales tax, with 98% of revenue from sales taxes going to a general fund. Maine's governor is against the legislation, saying it's \"not just bad for Maine, it can be deadly.\" But supporters have raised more than $3.2 million to fight for it. The state's newspapers were divided on the issue.Arizona: RejectedThe battle for legalization in Arizona was very close, according to polls, but the proposition was ultimately rejected, with 52% of voters saying no.Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996. The passing of Proposition 205, would have meant people 21 or older could possess up to one ounce and grow up to six plants in their homes --  similar to the other state laws that were up for consideration. The law would have created a Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control that would have regulated, tested and overseen sales.People caught smoking it in public places would have been fined, as would have people who possessed more than the legal limit. A 15% sales tax was also planned to be deposited in a Marijuana Fund and distributed to the Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control and to the Department of Revenue. School districts and the state health department would have also received part of the money. Nevada: ApprovedIn Nevada, it was a yes.This \"yes\" on Question 2 will make recreational use of 1 ounce or less legal or one-eighth of an ounce or less of concentrated marijuana legal for people age 21 and older. Medical marijuana was legalized in Nevada in 2000. The new law will allow stores, manufacturers and distributors to set up shop in the state. People can also grow six plants for personal use as long as it is in an enclosed area with a lock. The law will create fines for growing marijuana within public view. You could also get fined for smoking it in a public place or in a moving vehicle. No marijuana businesses will be allowed to set up shop within 1,000 feet of a school and 500 feet of a community facility.Nevada will also put a 15% excise tax on it. The money will go to support schools and the regulation of the drug. A number of legislators and unions have voiced support for the measure. Conservative megadonor and casino owner Sheldon Adelson was against it. A number of legislators voiced support for legalization, suggesting that it could bring additional tourist revenue to the state.

{"_id":"Art made from decommissioned guns meant to start a conversation","articleText":" (CNN)Jonathan Ferrara is a modern art gallery owner driven by an old-fashioned idea: He wants the pieces he has gathered at his gallery in New Orleans to hold a mirror up to society and reflect an issue that has become a touchy one for Americans.He wants Americans to see our relationship with guns for what it is.His traveling art installation of modern sculptures, photographs, paintings, video and mixed media uses more than 180 decommissioned guns, mostly bought through the New Orleans Police Department's buyback program, as raw material. The art is also captured in a new book, \"Guns in the Hands of Artists.\" Like the mission Picasso had in creating \"Guernica\" -- to raise critical awareness about the suffering and horror of the Spanish civil war after the Nazis wiped out an entire city -- Ferrara wants this art to start a difficult conversation. \"We want more than the screaming match. We wanted to take the conversation out of the polarized rhetoric into the realm of art as a possible means for a productive dialogue,\" Ferrara said. \"If you talk numbers or stats or you just listen to the vitriol, you lose the emotional content that should be a part of this conversation. Art captures the emotional best, and hopefully, it makes you think.\"The numbers show a stark reality. About 111,000 Americans are shot annually, including people shot by someone else and people who shoot themselves by accident or in suicide. About 33,800 die as a result of those injuries. For perspective, the number of deaths from gunshot wounds is nearly the same as the number who die from car accidents each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gun violence is clearly a \"serious threat to public health,\" according to the American Medical Association. Although place names like Pulse, Sandy Hook or Columbine have come to symbolize the horror of high-profile mass shootings, many everyday shootings happen out of the spotlight. When Ferrara first commissioned the exhibit of works from a diverse group of artists in 1996 with the help of fellow artist Brian Borrello, New Orleans' gun violence was so bad, the city had earned the nickname \"Murder City.\" It hasn't been able to shake it.\"The thing about this exhibition, we know from whence we speak,\" Ferrara said. He has brought the show to other cities plagued by gun violence, including Miami, St. Louis and Minneapolis. It has also been installed in places for policy-makers to see, like the Aspen Ideas Festival and the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington. Sen. Tim Kaine sponsored the exhibit there and wrote an essay to accompany a photograph of Ferrara's sculpture.Kaine is one of several people to write essays that Ferrara calls \"literary art\" to accompany photos of the art in his book. Others include Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011. Forty percent of the participants are gun owners, and 40% are victims of gun violence. One piece featured in the book, called \"Echo, Repeat, and Repetition,\" is a conversation that accompanies a still from a video installation that shows a large pile of guns. The talk is between Lolis Eric Elie, a writer for the HBO series \"Treme,\" and New Orleans resident Claudia Jones. Jones has lived much of her life in the New Orleans projects. The 60-year-old lost her three sons and a grandson in separate instances of gun violence. Each was killed while engaged in everyday activities. Her oldest was killed while coming home from a school dance in 1991. She lost her second son after he left his girlfriend's place. Her last son was shot and killed on the way home from a basketball game. Despite the tragedies, she still finds hope. \"God's been good to me. I lost my children, but he's still good to me. He's left me here for a reason,\" she tells Elie. None of the killings has been solved. Kaine's essay focuses on his frustrations as a lawmaker. A gun owner and a Second Amendment advocate, he wants \"more sensible\" restrictions. Kaine was Virginia governor during the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Afterward, he pushed through laws that improved background checks and created more help for mental health that he considers \"concrete steps to reduce gun violence.\" But he wants more and felt hamstrung by gun advocates -- and still does now, on the national stage. He believes there is an urgent need to \"put an end to the crisis.\"His essay accompanies Ferrara's sculpture \"Excalibur No More.\" It's a shotgun sticking out of a rock, a play on the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. When creating it, Ferrara experienced the ease with which someone can buy a gun. He got it in a private sale. The seller and his 15-year-old son came into his gallery carrying the shotgun and a bandolier \"like from the Wild West\" in a duffel bag.\"They asked if I had any questions,\" Ferrara said. And that was about it. There was no paperwork, no receipt. No one knew that ownership had been transferred, and it was all legal. \"It perplexed me,\" he said. In addition to the new book, Ferrara hopes to bring the exhibit to other cities. Talking about the book with a gun violence expert from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Ferrara said he was reminded that \"for every issue, there comes a tipping point where things are poised to change.\"\"I hope this will add to the conversation,\" Ferrara said. \"Because in the end, no matter what you believe about guns, everyone should want America to be safer.\"  ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/health/guns-in-the-hands-of-artists/index.html"}

{"_id":"As Trump steps into office, TV comedies will step up","articleText":" (CNN)It's long been said that to escape reality, people often turn to fiction. But in a post-election world -- one that in a little over a week has seen protests, hate crimes and complex emotions -- some people may look to their favorite television comedies for perspective on America's new political reality. Following a path paved by Norman Lear's \"All in the Family,\" television sitcoms have historically addressed a range of social issues. And in the last few years, there's been a rise in the number of comedies with more to offer than just laughs.Netflix's \"Master of None\" took on Hollywood's diversity problem. FX's \"You're the Worst\" and the CW's \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" recently featured storylines aimed at destigmatizing abortion. \"Lady Dynamite\" was praised for its handling of mental illness. ABC's \"blackish\" and NBC's \"The Carmichael Show\" used a deft hand in exploring racial justice. In a TV landscape with more than 500 shows, most are unlikely to explore Trump-inspired political themes, simply because it wouldn't be a good fit. But a few comedies will undoubtedly portray life in America with a President Trump.Kenya Barris, creator of \"black-ish,\" told CNN he's still working through his own feelings and emotions about the election results. He was a supporter of Hillary Clinton. But writing scripts that address the aftermath of the election has been \"cathartic,\" he said.Prior to the episode he's working on now, which will reference the election results, Barris was never inclined to use the show to directly respond to an event. \"This will probably be the first time that something has affected us to the point where I want to actually topically write about it,\" he said of the election episode.It is set to be a multi-generational story, according to Barris.Pops (Lawrence Fishburne) will have a certain outlook \"because he's been through the Civil Rights Movement,\" Barris said. Conversely, the Johnson children -- much like Barris' own -- have grown up \"with a black family in the White House.\"RELATED: How 'black-ish' turned 'Hope' into Emmy honors\"This is the first time for them that the rubber is hitting the road for them,\" Barris said. \"And I told my wife, the way you shine a diamond is you have to scratch it ... I think my children are getting their first taste of that.\" Barris had no specific tease for Dre's (Anthony Anderson) reaction, but the Johnson patriarch was seen a few episodes back making a tribute video to the Obama family, set to Boys II Men's \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye To Yesterday.\" (That is probably the only hint anyone needs.) Barris sees a \"silver lining\" in his disappointment. \"One of our writers, Emily, said she feels that there's a lot of people who are feeling a sense of loss in this race for the first time, and because of that, I think there's an opportunity for us to come together,\" he said. \"Let's reach across the aisle and say, '50 million people felt this way, another way.' Let's stop calling them crazy, let's stop calling them wrong, let's stop saying they got deceived and conned. Let's come together on our side and reach across to their side and say, 'What are you feeling? How can we meet in the middle? How can we do what's best for this country as a whole?'\"Constance Wu, star of ABC's \"Fresh Off the Boat,\" thinks the post-election landscape will also shine a new light on existing TV shows.\"I think my show is quite relevant because it takes place in the '90s and that was a time before an outsider could find a group of similarly minded people because there was no internet,\" she told CNN recently at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards. \"I think right now when our country feels very divided, it's that same struggle. It's trying to understand the people around you in order to be more loving and inclusive.\" \"Fresh Off the Boat\" is also a story about how \"immigrants make our country better,\" she said. \"The people who were born here, their acceptance of those immigrants and the curiosity to know their stories, makes them better people, too, because they get to understand stories outside of their sphere of existence, which is a type of education,\" she said. \"And education never hurt anyone.\"Barris sees family comedies particularly well positioned to have a conversation after the election because, he said, \"you can't not talk about anything in a family.\" \"It's sort of less contrived and an organic place to have those conversations than, say, a 'Friends' or a 'Seinfeld,'\" he said. \"Those shows, in their truest forms, when they're at their best, really are about nothing. They're about people having fun and living their lives. But, I think, a family show is about people in a family dealing with life.\" Above all, the show must go on. Even if, as Barris said, the environment in which it exists has inherently transformed.\"I think the world has changed from Tuesday to Wednesday, so I think that has to be reflective in everything we do,\" he said. \"I think the show is still going to be funny and our show, but I think the world has changed.\" ","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/entertainment/tv-comedy-after-trump/index.html"}

{"_id":"Australian zoo celebrates rare puggle birth ","articleText":" (CNN)It took almost 30 years, but the Taronga Zoo in Sydney has finally been graced with some baby puggles.No, we're not talking about the dog breed. Puggles are baby short-beaked echidnas, a species of spiny anteater. The babies debuted last week at the newly completed breeding facility at the zoo, though they were hatched all the way back in August. After they're born, the little puggles cozy up in their mothers' pouch until they grow spines and hair for protection.Besides being fat-bellied handfuls of pure cuteness, echidnas are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity. According to the Taronga Zoo's Paul Fahy, their numbers are decreasing in their native Australia due to loss of habitat. They are shy and elusive in the wild, making reproductive habits nearly impossible to study.   Obviously, this makes the zoo's new puggle trio even more precious. \"All three mothers are doing an amazing job and tending to their puggles as needed. We have one mum, Spike, who is so attentive that she returns to feed her baby every second day,\" said Suzie Lemon, a keeper at Taronga Zoo. \"This is a big step forward for Taronga. By monitoring the puggles so closely we've now got a good broad understanding of their growth cycle and development,\" Lemon explained. \"A day in the puggle world consists of lots of sleeping. They can be buried up to 30cm deep in their burrow, so they'll just sleep and use all their energy to grow and develop.\"Pudgy AND sleepy? Echidnas are officially your new Thanksgiving spirit animal.

{"_id":"Baby simulators not effective in preventing pregnancy, study says","articleText":" (CNN)Baby simulator programs, designed to teach teenage girls how difficult it is to take care of a baby and deter them from getting pregnant, may actually backfire. Girls who went through such programs were more likely to become pregnant or have an abortion, according to a study published in the journal Lancet. Researchers tracked girls in 57 schools in Western Australia, from ages 13 to 15 until 20, through hospital medical and abortion clinic records. Among the 2,800 girls who participated in the study from 2003 to 2006, 1,200 were randomly assigned to participate in baby simulator programs, while the rest underwent the standard pregnancy prevention curriculum. The simulator program, called Virtual Infant Parenting, is an adaptation of the American Baby Think It Over program, created by Realityworks. The VIP program consists of workbooks, documentary viewing, four educational sessions and caring for interactive baby dolls over the weekend, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning. The fake baby cries when it needs be fed, burped, rocked or changed and tracks mishandling and how well the doll is cared for. At the time of the study, each doll cost about $1,200 Australian, equivalent to about $900 US.  The study found that 8% of girls who cared for the model babies had given birth at least once by age 20, compared with only 4% of those who took the standard classes. Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group. This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls' entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist Sally Brinkman of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. 'Clearly, the program doesn't work'The researchers took into account the girls' socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant. \"It is definitely more than just a trend,\" Brinkman said. \"Clearly, the program doesn't work.\" According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States. The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies' adapted versions.The study \"was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers' 'adaptation' and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,\" Boettcher said in a statement. \"The RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.\"Brinkman said that although her study didn't involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks' programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall \"very similar\" to what Realityworks recommends. \"I would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,\" she said. She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer. Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, \"it's generally not a thing for people to say 'oh, they just need more of the drug.' \"Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers' money.'Maybe it wasn't that bad'Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned. Brinkman suspects that a positive experience with taking care of a baby and getting attention from family and friends could be part of the reason. \"It gives them confidence. ... they think, 'maybe it wasn't that bad. I could do this,' \" she said.Dr. Julie Quinlivan, one of the study's reviewers and a professor at the University of Notre Dame Australia, echoed Brinkman's thoughts in a comment in the Lancet (PDF). Leaving the father out of the pregnancy equation and the program not starting early enough are also possible contributing factors, she wrote. The root causes of teenage pregnancy, Quinlivan noted in an email to CNN, include social, psychological and educational disadvantages. Since these factors are similar in developed countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, the study's results are applicable in these countries, she said.\"Future studies need to look at strategies that promote improvements in educational opportunities for vulnerable girls as a strategy to decrease teenage pregnancy,\" Quinlivan said. \"The more educational opportunities you provide vulnerable women with, the greater the likelihood they will find employment and have improved healthcare outcomes for themselves and their children, and the less likely they are to regard premature parenthood as a 'career path.' \"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html"}

{"_id":"Bannon rejects white nationalism: 'I'm an economic nationalist'","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's selection for White House chief strategist, says he's an \"economic nationalist\" but rejects racist and anti-Semitic elements of the nationalist alt-right movement. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive, cast himself as a strident opponent of \"globalism\" -- including free trade deals that Trump has bemoaned. \"I'm an economic nationalist. I am an America first guy,\" Bannon said in the interview. \"And I have admired nationalist movements throughout the world, have said repeatedly strong nations make great neighbors. I've also said repeatedly that the ethno-nationalist movement, prominent in Europe, will change over time. I've never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.\"Bannon said that \"the black working and middle class and the Hispanic working and middle class, just like whites, have been severely hurt by the policies of globalism.\" He said he had urged Trump to reach out to minority communities on the campaign trail. \"I was the one who said we are going to Flint, Michigan, we are going to black churches in Cleveland, because the thrust of this movement is that we are going to bring capitalism to the inner cities,\" Bannon told the newspaper. Bannon has been a target of Democratic criticism since his selection by Trump. Many liberals have pointed to incendiary Breitbart headlines -- items that mock \"trannies,\" labeled Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol a \"renegade Jew\" and more -- in urging Trump to cut ties with Bannon. He dismissed that criticism, casting it as disappointment from Democrats who expected Trump to lose. \"They were ready to coronate Hillary Clinton. That didn't happen, and I'm one of the reasons why. So, by the way, I wear these attacks as an emblem of pride,\" he said. He also cast Breitbart as \"edgy\" but \"vibrant,\" and said, \"Our definition of the alt-right is younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment.\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/steve-bannon-donald-trump-nationalist/index.html"}
{"_id":"Battle over race returns to Capitol with Sessions' bid to become AG","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is preparing to face fresh scrutiny for a decades' old charge he made racially-charged comments while a US Attorney in his home state of Alabama. The allegations cost him a job as a federal judge in 1986 and have the potential to sink his nomination to be attorney general under President-elect Donald Trump. To survive, he will need to carefully distance himself from the damaging charges and deftly manage how his Senate colleagues -- and the public -- react to them.It won't be easy. Many Democrats already are deeply disturbed by the allegations that Sessions may have called an African-American lawyer \"boy\" and accused the NAACP and ACLU of being \"un-American.\" They promise to re-investigate the charges to determine if they are still relevant. But Democrats are equally concerned about fourth-term senator's current views on immigration and border control, which they consider strident and racially-biased. They worry that in the sensitive post as the top law enforcement official in the country, Sessions may not treat all people equally under law and already some Democrats privately want to defeat him.\"While many of us have worked with Senator Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee. While Senator Sessions and I differ on a great many issues, I am committed to a full and fair process,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who will be the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee next year when it holds confirmation hearings for Sessions, who also sits on the committee.In 2009, Sessions told CNN's Dana Bash that his 1986 confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee -- a contentious affair where he clashed repeatedly with Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and other Democrats -- was \"really heartbreaking to me.\"Visibly upset in the television interview, the earnest senator pleaded his case. \"That was not fair. That was not accurate. Those were false charges and distortions of anything that I did, and it really was not. I never had those kinds of views, and I was caricatured in a way that was not me,\" he said. The question is whether Session's heartfelt appeal that he was a victim of wrongful allegations and not the perpetrator of racially-insensitive conduct can convince senators to confirm him. The haze of time and distance from the events may assist Sessions, especially with many of the players of the 1986 drama no longer in the Senate.Political connectionsSessions' political ties to Trump and Senate Republican leaders could help him too. He's a fierce defender of the President-elect and was the first senator to endorse him. Trump said he could have any job he wanted -- and he mulled becoming secretary of defense before settling on AG.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said he \"strongly supports\" the nomination and promised a swift confirmation process for him. Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noting that Sessions was once the top Republican on the committee, said he is \"confident he would be reported favorably out of the committee.\"Also helping Sessions are the new Senate rules that will allow him to be confirmed with the support of just 51 senators, not the supermajority 60 that were required until recently. That means Republicans can confirm Sessions without any Democratic support. Sessions, who will want to be confirmed with bipartisan support, will point Democrats to comments from the late Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who in 1986 was one of only two GOP members of the Judiciary Committee to vote against Sessions' nomination to the federal bench. In 2009, as Specter was leaving the Republican Party and joining the Democratic caucus, he said he \"regretted\" that vote.\"Because I have found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,\" Specter told reporters.Defending Sessions' record on civil rights issues, Trump spokesman Jason Miller noted Friday that Session had voted for a 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act, had voted to confirm Eric Holder -- who is black -- as attorney general, and voted to give civil rights legend Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal.As an example of the Trump team readying for a battle, a public relations firm sent reporters pictures of Sessions attending the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday at the Edmund Pettus Bridge and holding hands with Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia. The release said the photos are 'Worth 1,000 words\" and the Sessions' critics may not want the photos to be seen.Race and the CapitolThe difficult topic of race relations is never far from the surface in the Capitol, where momentous battles over slavery and civil rights were fought out on the House and Senate floors. Today, lawmakers remain divided over questions about police shootings of black Americans, voting rights and even the appropriateness of Confederate imagery in the historic building. Sessions is certainly not the first senator to grapple with racial issues but still advance his career. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan as a young man before serving 51 years in the Senate. Byrd repeatedly apologized for his membership in the group -- calling it the \"greatest mistake of my life\" -- and rose to become majority leader and one of the most respected members of the body. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-South Carolina, ran for president as a segregationist in 1948 and led a record-breaking 24 hour filibuster of a civil rights bill in 1957. Through his 48 years in the Senate, he took steps towards racial reconciliation and today a room in the Capitol is named for him. (Although aides will work to ensure that the bust of the controversial senator is not visible when that room is used for TV interviews.)One man who was unable to escape a racially-based political maelstrom, is former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi. In 2002, at a birthday party for 100-year-old Thurmond, Lott said the country \"wouldn't' have had all these problems over the years\" had Thurmond won the White House in 1948. He was out of a job in a matter of weeks.Lott's former aide, Ron Bonjean, told CNN that his boss really lost his job because he was in a power struggle with President George W. Bush, not because of the off-handed, impolitic comment at a birthday party. \"He stepped into the fray not realizing the grave political situation he was in. Not realizing the Bush administration was out to get him beyond the comments he made about Strom Thurmond, for which he apologized several times,\" Bonjean said. \"It was exacerbated by the Bush administration, which saw an opportunity to put in a new majority leader that would be more responsive to their needs.\"Bonjean, a longtime Capitol Hill aide and now a political strategist, had thoughts on what Sessions should do if Democrats bring up his alleged old remarks.\"He needs to be very clear about what he thinks about race in America today and that everyone is equal under the law in his eyes and disavow anything that could be construed as comments that would showcase otherwise. You have to do that straight away. It's a very dangerous situation when you're trying to parse your comments,\" Bonjean said.

{"_id":"Being a 'superhero': The South African volunteers trialing a HIV vaccine","articleText":"Gugulethu Township, South Africa (CNN)Every day, Luyanda Ngcobo's routine is the same: It starts with a trip to the back cupboard, where safely hidden away is a bottle of nevirapine, an antiretroviral pill he has to take twice a day for the rest of his life. \"Some young people don't want to take the pills because they have that anger like, 'Why me? Why do I have this particular disease and why do I need to take these pills?' \" he said. But Ngcobo has never had the luxury of choice. His HIV was passed on from his mother at birth. He says the \"Why me?\" question often pops up, though it is never followed by finger-pointing. \"I never had that blame feeling in my heart, no,\" he insisted. \"Because I know that my mother wouldn't have purposely given me HIV if she knew. Not my mom. That is how she is.\" The truth about HIV's 'patient zero'Lifesaving treatment Ngcobo's one pill taken twice a day is a far cry from the cocktail of drugs needed to combat the condition just a few years ago.Billions of dollars in funding by the United States through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief means millions of people are now on lifesaving HIV treatment -- and that treatment continues to improve.Ngcobo's medication is also more effective than previous tablets, which he says is important, because the stigma around HIV and AIDS still exists. \"You can't even cough without people feeling sorry for you,\" he said. That stigma is one reason why many young people keep their status hidden and why many more refuse to even get tested. Ngcobo says he doesn't know how many people in this tightly populated township are living with HIV or are on courses of treatment like his.  But the government estimates that more than 3 million South Africans are on antiretrovirals: the highest figure in the world and a tremendous public health burden for this developing nation. The children with a built-in defense against AIDS'People are still dying'No generation suffers from the effects of the disease more than Ngcobo's, but prevention and treatment, especially among teenagers, goes only so far.\"For me, it seems incredible that anyone could still die of AIDS,\" said Linda-Gail Bekker, who runs the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation's Emavundleni Research Centre. \"And people are still dying. I see it in my daily practice, particularly young people.\" Worldwide, it's estimated that one adolescent becomes infected with HIV/AIDS every two minutes.Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the perception that the global HIV/AIDS crisis is over is \"completely unwarranted.\" He points to the United States, where, despite prevention efforts, infection rates have remained stubbornly level for the past 15 years. In South Africa, there are still more teenagers with HIV than are receiving treatment. That, says Bekker, is a lethal combination. \"If we ultimately want to control this epidemic, we are going to need to control the number of people becoming infected, and there is no better way, no sustainable way, than having a prophylactic vaccine,\" she said. \"It is the holy grail of epidemic control.\" New HIV vaccine to be trialled in South AfricaVaccine finally within reach?Recruiting in a mall is usually difficult, says Noro Tshongoyi. Sure, there are plenty of crowds, but people are too busy shopping to pay attention. \"They don't want to just stand there and listen to me talk,\" she said. But it's different with this trial, she says, since she's offering them a chance to be part of history. In the past month, sites in South Africa have begun enrolling more than 5,000 HIV-negative volunteers to take part in the largest vaccine trial in nearly a decade.  The phase III HVTN 702 study builds off a 2009 trial in Thailand, which was the first to show any signs of protection against HIV, with 31% protection against the virus. By amplifying the vaccine, researchers are now hoping for 50% to 60% efficacy in the South African trial. Fauci says that even a moderately effective vaccine would be a \"major advance.\" Tshongoyi approaches two young women who need very little convincing before exchanging details. \"The problem is, they can't negotiate when it comes to sex,\" she said. \"They want to protect themselves, but with a condom, they can't. If their boyfriend doesn't want to use one, that is it.\"Meet the teenager controlling her HIV'The last chapters of HIV'Bekker's Emavundleni Research Centre was built for this moment; it sits in the heart of a township that has felt the full brunt of the epidemic. For years, the facility has carried out trial after trial, though never one like HVTN 702. \"We have written half the book,\" Bekker said. \"This is not the time to put the book down and walk away. We can collectively write the last chapters of HIV.\"But the South African government recently redirected a portion of its research budget, and there are fears that outside funding from the United States and other donors could also dry up. If HVTN 702 doesn't succeed, researchers know, the next trial would be years away. It's early afternoon, and the center is still full of mainly young women, desperate to gain control.Inside one of the examination rooms, Azola Dayeni reads about the pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) study she has enrolled in. \"I have a partner, but I don't trust him,\" she explained. She hopes the PrEP will keep her safe -- but, she said, \"a vaccine is the ultimate protection.\"Time to write last chapter on HIVAn HIV-free generation?No matter how good treatment becomes, the impact of HIV on Titila Mputa's family is permanent.\"I just went out to school, and when I left, (my mother) was fine,\" Mputa recalled. \"When I came back, she was not there, and they told me that she was in hospital, that she had a stroke.\" Four successive strokes, complications of the virus, crippled her mother. The treatment saved her mother's life, but Mputa doesn't want any other families to suffer like they did. She is HIV-negative, so she volunteered to participate in the initial phases of the study that cleared the way for HVTN 702. How HIV spread around the worldShe knows it's too late for her family and for many in her generation but is excited to be able to help ensure that there's hope for the next. \"You get to be the superhero that you want to be,\" Mputa said. \"You doing this can help a thousand people out there. You doing this can help create an HIV-free generation.\"  ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/health/hiv-aids-vaccine-trial-south-africa/index.html"}

{"_id":"Bernie Sanders supporters rally to remake the Democratic Party","articleText":" (CNN)Bernie Sanders is back on the stump.The independent senator from Vermont, who has emerged as a party leader in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's defeat last week, said Thursday that progressives must dedicate themselves to winning over voters who turned to Donald Trump on Election Day.In a speech to hundreds of supporters and activists gathered on a chilly fall afternoon in Washington, Sanders pinned Trump's victory on the Democratic establishment's failure to engage with millions of Americans who feel forgotten by political leaders and hemmed in by stagnant local economies.\"The party has got to recognize some very important realities that Donald Trump, in fact, recognized,\" Sanders said, keeping up a drumbeat he began last week in a New York Times op-ed and has returned to in a round of subsequent appearances. \"And that is, yes, we are better off today economically than we were eight years ago, we've made a lot of progress in a lot of areas. But there are millions and millions of people today, working-class people, middle-class people, who are living in despair. And we have got to recognize that reality.\"Sanders campaigned heartily for Clinton after she clinched the Democratic nomination this summer, but as the American left begins to consider its options in the wake of a slow-building electoral wipeout -- Republicans now control the White House, both chambers of Congress, and dominate state politics -- he and the movement that fueled his campaign are moving quickly to grab hold of the party.\"There is a lot of pain in America,\" Sanders said in a short speech just a few hundred feet from his Senate office. \"Capitol Hill doesn't understand it -- we do. And we are going to reach out to those brothers and sisters (who voted for Trump) and work with them.\"The organizers behind the rally, which was planned months before the election and initially slated as a demonstration against the the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact President Barack Obama has championed but has been rejected by many progressives who are leery of expansive free trade bill. But as if to further underscore the odd, partisan-defying moment, the deal is now all but dead -- thanks in large part to Trump's opposition.Activists in Upper Senate Park on Thursday wrestled with the irony, some by arguing that the President-elect had hijacked the economic populist movement they had resurrected. \"TPP was stopped because of you and Donald Trump had nothing to do with it,\" Tefere Gebre, the executive vice president of the AFL-CIO, told the crowd. \"Working together, we made the TPP toxic for politicians. Then opportunistic politicians tried to jump on the bandwagon and say, 'I was there too.'\"Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat and Sanders ally, congratulated activists on defeating a wide range of \"forces arrayed against us,\" including \"financial institutions, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the president of the United States, pharmaceutical industries, and big agriculture industries.\"\"They thought we couldn't do it,\" she said, \"but we certainly showed them.\" Before former Ohio state senator Nina Turner took the stage to begin emceeing duties, RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, confessed she and the group, which organized the event, had not expected such a swift or politically confounding victory.\"I wasn't anticipating this and I wasn't thinking of this when we planned the rally,\" she said, \"but we're very, very excited about (the turnout). Millions of people want to engage. We're not seeing a falloff in terms of energy.\"On the same afternoon Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan formalized his plans to challenge to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, DeMoro argued that the power center in liberal politics had already shifted -- and that while Sanders stood as progressives' \"fundamental leader,\" it would not rely on him for direction at every step.  \"(Sanders) has has millions looking to him for hope and direction -- he's critical,\" she said. \"Having said that, the movie was there before Bernie. Bernie was able to galvanize the movement. The movement got much, much stronger. So while Bernie is critical, the movement exists, the movement has a life of its own.\"Two hours later, a group of about 25 union nurses walked a half-mile south to the Longworth House Office Building, passed through metal detectors, took elevators to the second floor, and gathered around the entryway to House Speaker Paul Ryan's office.With a letter -- and piece of pie -- in hand, they asked a staffer if Ryan was available to discuss their opposition to his longstanding plans to remake Medicare.\"Paul is not here right now,\" he informed them politely, and then after exchanging contact information, closed the heavy wood door behind him.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-party-protest/index.html"}
{"_id":"Bespoke Bentley: Inside the luxury car manufacturer's billion-dollar turnaround","articleText":"John McIlroy is Deputy Editor of Auto Express and Carbuyer. (CNN)There was a time when British luxury car manufacturer Bentley produced just a few hundred vehicles a year and hoped that would be enough to keep it alive. Had it not been for Bentley's reputation -- garnered through success at the famous Le Mans 24 Hours sports car race -- it could have disappeared altogether.But no more -- now Bentley is buzzing.Its factory in Crewe is bursting at the seams, and being reconfigured to allow the firm additional capacity. And although the company never admits sales targets, it seems inevitable that in the next two years it will break its own annual production record by delivering as many as 12,000 cars.Read: What does it take to restore the finest cars?Revolutionary investmentThe Bentley revolution started in 1998 when its owner, military firm Vickers, offloaded it to the enormous Volkswagen Group (VW).Bentley would deliver just over 400 cars that year, and the German management at VW could have allowed the brand to wither.Instead it invested heavily, and continues to do so. The firm is sinking almost one billion dollars into Bentley's factory as the British brand -- founded by W.O. Bentley in North London in 1919 -- heads towards its centenary celebrations.Read: How one of the last British car brands conquered the worldGenerating the success to support this expansion has taken careful nurturing from VW, and it has nudged Bentley into the 21st century while retaining the craftsmanship and bespoke service that have kept it alive for almost a hundred years. Its first focus has been production, and the site at Crewe in the UK has changed dramatically over the past decade.Buildings which once made Merlin engines for famous World War Two planes like the Lancaster, Hurricane and Spitfire in the 1940s have now been cleaned, painted and equipped with the largest roof-based solar panel set-up in the UK.The entire site is now being used and new buildings include a bodyshell preparation facility and a research and development center -- something unthinkable in the 1980s.Model of accelerationFrom an automotive perspective, the vehicle responsible for driving the current sales charge is the Bentayga, a luxury SUV that split opinion when it was first introduced. Now Bentley's best-selling vehicle, the Bentayga -- which is based on the much cheaper Audi Q7 (and all the more profitable for it) -- has over a two year waiting list in some markets.The vehicle is only a success because Bentley has disguised its origins with the sort of sumptuous quality that made it famous in the first place. Read: Ferrari reveals fastest convertible of all time -- and has already sold outIn perhaps its cleverest move of all, VW has been careful to retain two of the firm's key areas of expertise -- leather and wood. In the leather shop, huge hides from cattle reared in enclosures without any barbed wire (to reduce the risk of imperfections) are inspected by trained specialists. Any areas of the leather that don't pass the test are marked, then a state-of-the-art cutting device uses these squiggles to calculate the most efficient way of cutting out the material required.It's a curious sight, these vastly experienced craftsmen and women working seamlessly with clinical technology. But it's a classic example of enhancement through modernization -- productivity and efficiency have been improved, without impacting on quality.The same goes for the wood shop. Once a shed filled with choking dust, the facility is now more like a science lab. It barely smells of wood at all, in fact, a tribute to the sort of ventilation system that could probably serve as an aircraft wind tunnel. But at its heart are second- or third-generation employees, training up apprentices in skills going back a century or more.Royal 'special forces'They're needed, too, because it takes a skilled workforce like this to deliver the sort of bespoke experience so many Bentley owners crave. What sets this car apart from their other seven could be the fact that its paint color matches that of their client's regular nail varnish -- rumor has it that the client who requested this painted the Bentley rep's nails instead of handing over a bottle as a sample. Or that the leather upholstery is the same hue as their favorite sofa.

Cosby now faces criminal charges in the case.Cosby attorneys said he only answered deposition questions because Bruce Castor, the district attorney at the time, promised to never bring a criminal case based on Constand's allegations. Constand was a former employee at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University. Castor said he made that promise so the entertainer would not be able to use the Fifth Amendment to avoid answering questions in a deposition, according to an email from Castor to his successor, Risa Vetri Ferman. The civil suit was the best chance Constand had for finding justice, the Castor email said.The current district attorney, Kevin Steele, responded in court documents that a formal nonprosecution agreement never existed, just a press release. He also said this kind of immunity can only be extended to a witness, not a defendant.In issuing the order, Judge Steven O'Neill said a promise to not prosecute Cosby in the future did not exist based upon the evidence presented in court.

{"_id":"Bonsai masters: The ancient secrets behind their centuries-old trees","articleText":" (CNN)\"I am always caring for my bonsai trees -- it's as necessary for me as eating every day,\" says award-winning bonsai sensei, Kunio Kobayashi. A cross between horticulture and art, bonsai trees may be tiny, but they have an immense impact on the masters who care for them. Originating from the ancient art of \"penjing\" in China, bonsai was first introduced to Japan in the 6th century by a group of Japanese Zen Buddhism students returning from their overseas travels. They dubbed it \"bonsai\", which literally means \"planted in a container\", and at its most elementary level the art is simply growing a wild tree inside a small vessel. Maintenance and careYears of styling, wiring, watering, repotting and pruning separate amateur bonsai trainers from master sensei. The fragile plants must be monitored every day for signs of deadly insect infestation or disease. Kobayashi, who has spent nearly three decades dedicated to bonsai, says paying careful attention has helped him keep an estimated 1,000-year-old juniper tree, which he bought at auction, alive and thriving. \"No matter how much love and passion you have, you cannot take care of bonsai if you don't know the basics,\" says Kobayashi, who cares for the ancient tree at his Shunkaen Bonsai Museum in Tokyo, Japan. \"It takes six to 10 years of apprenticeship to learn those basics by repeating them over and over.\"On the other side of the world, at the US National Arboretum in Washington DC, bonsai museum curator Jack Sustic looks after a 400-year-old Yamaki white pine that survived the Hiroshima nuclear bombing.\"It's a very humble art,\" Sustic says.  \"When you work on bonsai, we're working on their schedule, not ours. I have to make my schedule based on the time of the year, and when it's best to do certain tasks on certain trees.\"\"Often people say bonsai are like children, and they really are,\" he continues. \"You care for them, you're concerned for them, you worry about them. If they look healthy and beautiful you are proud and want to show them off.\" Read: A crystal universe that actually existsBelow, Kobayashi and Sustic discuss how they care for some of the world's longest living bonsai.A natural touch\"I want to express the tree's inner beauty. So I am watching the way that the trunk and branches move,\" says Kobayashi. \"The goal is to make the tree look natural, as if a human never touched it. The silhouette should resemble a wild tree, with proper proportions.\"Read: Fifty shades of jade: Why Chinese buyers spend millions on this stoneBonsai should be kept outdoors\"I think the biggest mistake that people make when they get a bonsai is they bring it inside,\" says Sustic. \"Indoor bonsai trees exist, but the majority of species have to live outside. They can come inside for three or five days, but need to spend the vast majority of their life outside. If not, they will slowly die.\"Prune to perfection\"When you begin, a bonsai often kind of looks like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree -- but it's like the ugly duckling that becomes a beautiful swan,\" says Sustic. \"You can create a bonsai pretty quickly if you have the right tools. The best tools to have are concave pruners. If you remove a branch, these pruners will create a concave cut in the trunk. It heals over flush, so you will never know there was a branch there. Read: Japanese photographer 'clones' women \"Whereas, if you were to cut with normal pruners, it would create a bump, called a callous\" Sustic warns. \"It's like when you wound your body and it creates a scab.\"Down to the wire\"Wire for the bonsai artist is like a paintbrush for other artists,\" says Sustic. \"We use wire to position the branch where we want the branches to grow. Depending on the species, the wire stays on for a month or over a year. The important thing is that we monitor the trees. We don't want the branches to start growing and become scarred by the wire.\"New roots\"To keep the tree alive, we have to re-pot the trees every two years, depending on the species,\" says Sustic. \"When we do that, we cut off a certain percentage of the roots. What that does, is it causes the tree to generate new roots. That keeps it happy, healthy and vigorous. So it's always growing.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/arts/the-art-of-bonsai/index.html"}
{"_id":"Brazilian jungle hides arresting art","articleText":"Anthony Bourdain visits Inhotim Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on \"Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown\" (CNN)It began with a hum. On a September night in the Brazilian countryside, a chorus of low voices floated through the palm trees, followed by a dozen or so performers wading across a lake; one by one, they emerged from the water and entered a glass-walled gallery, and proceeded, completely naked, to pour vats of translucent red goo into glass vessels hanging from the ceiling. This was the 10th anniversary celebration of Inhotim, a tamed 5,000-acre jungle where extraordinary art takes place. It was a decade ago that Brazilian magnate Bernardo Paz decided to convert his land and iron-mining fortune into a sprawling public contemporary art park. \"I don't know anything about art,\" the white-haired, softspoken millionaire says with a laugh, sipping a box of coconut water -- although this 1,300-piece collection says otherwise. In the spectacular landscape of Minas Gerais, the Brazilian state where Paz was born, art by the likes of Olafur Eliasson and Hélio Oiticica lives largely outside, alongside a luscious physical environment: reflective green ponds, 5,000 different plant species and a landscape design by the late Roberto Burle Marx. A trip to Inhotim can last several days, and the experience completely overturns the typical museum model; rather than simply viewing works, visitors encounter them. Down a narrow trail, you can come upon a glass geodesic dome in which Matthew Barney's monolithic \"De Lama Lâmina,\" a rusty tractor holding a whitewashed tree, roots and all, resides. You can also open a door and step into the seductive mirrored dance floor of Valeska Soares' \"Folly,\" or climb a hill to peer through Olafur Eliasson's \"Viewing Machine,\" an epic, stainless steel kaleidoscope that shatters and distorts the panoramic view of the park below.\"We had the capacity and responsibility to create a different kind of experience,\" says chief curator and creative director Allan Schwartzman, who seeks out works that make the best use of Inhotim's unique situation. 6 reasons to visit Minas Gerais, BrazilThis means cultivating the kind of art that would be impossible or impractical to house in an ordinary museum. His first commission for a permanent installation was in 2008, when he invited American artist Doug Aitken to come and develop whatever he pleased. \"When my taxi arrived, a man with a white beard drinking coconut water hugged me and said that I should look around, and if I had a vision, we would make that vision happen,\" Aitken recalls. \"It was an incredibly liberating scenario.\" Ultimately, the environment inspired \"Sonic Pavilion,\" a circular glass building where viewers ascend a spiraling wooden ramp that leads to a hole in which microphones embedded 700 feet into the ground relay the ongoing reverberations of the Earth. \"I don't know any other institution that would have done that,\" says Aitken. \"It's an amazing scenario in which to make art, and as a result, artists have created a radical spectrum of works.\" Throughout Inhotim, Paz has also built galleries for works that need to be experienced indoors -- photography, films, immersive environments -- devoted to single artists.Many of them are lesser-known installations made more compelling by their unfamiliarity. (In Cildo Meireles' gallery, a trickle of red paint leads visitors down a dark corridor to one sinister surprise.) The very first gallery was built out of necessity, before Paz had even conceived of opening his land to the public; \"True Rouge,\" a hanging sculpture of glass vessels by the late avant-garde Brazilian multimedia performance artist Tunga, was simply too big for his home.Tunga encouraged Paz to build a new space to house it, and a gallery was born. Tunga inaugurated the space with a performance that involved the pouring of translucent red goo onto both the statue and a choreographed group of naked bodies, a performance which, on its 10th anniversary, Inhotim restaged in his memory. Now in its 11th year, Inhotim shows no signs of slowing; Paz, who pours about $70 million of his own money into Inhotim's operations, has his eyes on expansion. His ultimate vision is for his tropical wonderland to include a high street of shops and hotels, one of which is already under construction. And as for the art, he leaves that to Schwartzman, who says he has 12 to 15 new projects  under way: an installation by Robert Irwin, an Infinity Room by Yayoi Kusama, three new projects by Anish Kapoor and a \"major\" new piece by Doris Salcedo. \"Along Inhotim's paths are different experiences that accumulate in their own unique ways,\" Schwartzman says. \"Right now, they can't be fully visited in a day, and soon, a visit will probably take three or four.\" Janelle Zara is a Los Angeles-based architecture, art and design writer.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/travel/inhotim-museum-minas-gerais-brazil/index.html"}

{"_id":"Burger King's menu, as selected by a nutritionist","articleText":"This story is part of a series on finding the healthiest menu options at some of the most popular fast food restaurant chains. (CNN)If you like burgers, hot dogs and crispy chicken, you're in luck if you take a trip to Burger King. But if you are the least bit nutrition-conscious, it's slim pickings when it comes to deciding what to eat at the popular fast food chain. The salads are few and the vegetables fewer. There's not much fruit aside from applesauce, apple juice and apple pie, and you won't find a yogurt cup on the menu, though milk and water are served as beverages. So it's fair to say that the task of finding acceptable healthy options from BK's menu is a bit challenging. Red, fried and processed meats aside, there are a few items that stand out in terms of their healthfulness, so much so that we mentioned those options for more than one category. For example, the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken is one of the healthiest options on BK's menu, along with the protein-rich Tendergrill chicken sandwich. Regardless of meal type, the Tendergrill chicken is always a better choice than the Tendercrisp chicken, which is fried. And then there's the veggie burger, for those who want to avoid meat.We recommend steering clear of bacon, found in many of the chain's cheese-containing burgers, and other processed meats, such as sausage (found in eight of the chain's breakfast sandwiches) and hot dogs. And while the Whopperrito  -- the newest addition to Burger King's menu -- may sound tempting, the mixture of beef and queso sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla offers about half a day's worth of saturated fat and sodium. If you want to splurge on fries or onion rings, choose the value size, which will make a much smaller dent in your daily calorie and sodium limits. For example, a large order of onion rings has 500 calories and 1,310 milligrams of sodium, or more than triple the calories and sodium than the value size portion, which has 150 calories and 400 milligrams of sodium. For a healthier side dish, choose the sodium-free applesauce for just 50 calories.As with other chains, avoid sugar-sweetened beverages. The smallest size, a 16-ounce soft drink, contains about 40 grams or 10 teaspoons of sugar. A 40-ounce cup has more than 100 grams, or more than 25 teaspoons. According to the American Heart Association, women should limit added sugars to no more than 6 teaspoons of sugar per day and men about 9 teaspoons. US dietary guidelines recommend a limit of 10% of calories from added sugars; on a 2,000-calorie diet, that translates to 12½ teaspoons. Below are the best Burger King options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by our picks for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kidsOur picks: Chicken Nuggets King Jr. meal (4 pieces) with ketchup, applesauce and fat-free milk When it comes to kid-specific lunch and dinner, choices at Burger King include chicken nuggets, a hamburger or a cheeseburger. The chicken nuggets are lowest in saturated fat: A four-piece serving has 2 grams of saturated fat, compared with 3 grams for the hamburger and 5 grams for the cheeseburger. A packet of kid-friendly ketchup for dipping is a welcome alternative to some of the higher-sodium sauces and has fewer sugars than the barbecue sauce. We like the fact that the King Jr. meal comes with applesauce and a choice of a beverage, though we highly recommend the fat-free milk over the apple juice, which has 20 grams (5 teaspoons) of sugar. You don't have to deny your child dessert, but be smart: The vanilla soft serve ice cream cone has 140 calories and 3 grams of saturated fat and is a better option than the chocolate fudge sundae, with 270 calories and 5 grams of saturated fat, or the vanilla milkshake, with 580 calories and 10 grams of saturated fat.For vegetariansOur picks: Morningstar Veggie Burger without mayo, ketchup or pickles and garden side salad without croutons and dressingFor those who want a meat-free meal, Burger King offers a Morningstar veggie burger (like the one found in supermarket freezers), topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, ketchup and mayo. But the condiments come at a cost: With all of the fixings, the sodium count registers at 1,060 milligrams. If you take away the mayo, ketchup and pickles, you can slash 240 milligrams of sodium. Add a garden side salad if you desire, but skip the croutons and dressing, which add even more sodium to the meal.For vegansOur picks: Garden side salad without cheese or croutons and with Golden Italian dressing, applesauce and French fries (value size) Aside from French fries, hash browns and French toast sticks, there isn't much to choose from when it comes to vegan options at Burger King. Though the veggie burger may be a welcome option for vegetarians, the same cannot be said for vegans, as the patty contains eggs and milk. You could theoretically fill a bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and romaine, but be prepared to be hungry soon after, as it won't provide much protein. The best we can recommend is a garden side salad (without cheese, croutons or egg-yolk-containing ranch dressing) with a side of applesauce. And if you feel like splurging, go for value size fries. For calorie counters Our picks: Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo; or veggie burger without mayo, ketchup and pickles; or garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, without dressing Believe it or not, there are many low-calorie items at Burger King. Our favorite is the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo. It has only 320 calories, but we really like the fact that it delivers 32 grams of protein and will keep you satisfied long after the meal, which is especially important if you are limiting calories. The veggie burger without mayo, pickles and ketchup is another appealing option, with 300 calories and 21 grams of protein. (Although the ketchup and pickles don't contribute many calories, cutting them brings the sodium count down by 170 milligrams.)And if you are willing to part with salad dressing, the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken has only 320 calories and 36 grams of protein. If part of your enjoyment of salad includes the dressing, use only half a packet. BK's Lite honey balsamic dressing is one of the lowest, at 120 calories per packet. Note: Don't look at calories in isolation, as some of the least healthy items on BK's menu are also some of the lowest-calorie options. A bacon cheeseburger has fewer than 300 calories, but it has less protein and more saturated fat than the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo or the veggie burger. And we don't recommend processed meats like bacon or a grilled hot dog, which has only 310 calories. If you are in the mood for a burger, go for a Whopper Jr., which has about half the calories of a regular Whopper.For the sugar-sensitiveOur picks: Garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, with a half packet of ranch dressing; or chicken nuggets (6 pieces) with ranch dipping sauce The garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken has just 1 teaspoon (or 4 grams) of sugar and is one of the lowest-sugar items on BK's menu. Though it comes with Lite balsamic vinaigrette dressing, the dressing appears to contribute 3 grams of sugar for every 2 tablespoons. We recommend the ranch dressing instead, which has only 1 gram of sugar per packet (use half the packet to limit sodium intake). The chicken nuggets are also sugar-free; however, steer clear of the barbecue dipping sauce, which has 2½ teaspoons (10 grams) of sugar per serving. The ranch, buffalo and zesty onion ring dipping sauces are lowest in sugars. Each has 1 gram per serving, though the ranch is lowest in sodium of the three sauces. We were tempted to include the original chicken sandwich without mayo, as it is also one of the lowest-sugar options on the menu, but it has close to 1,000 milligrams of sodium, even without the creamy condiment.For the salt-sensitive Our picks: Whopper Jr. without mayo, ketchup and pickles; or chicken nuggets (4 pieces), garden side salad without croutons and dressing; and applesauceThere's something to be said about junior sizes. They are guaranteed to have fewer nutrients across the board, compared with their regular-size counterparts. And in the case of sodium, that's a significant savings. A regular Whopper sandwich has 810 milligrams of sodium, but when you order the junior size, the count is cut by more than half, down to 390 milligrams, making it one of the lowest-sodium meals on BK's menu. Taking away the mayo, ketchup and pickles brings the sodium count down further, from 390 to 230 milligrams. Another low-sodium option is the four-piece chicken nuggets, at 310 milligrams, though we recommend skipping the sodium-laden dipping sauces. Pair them with the garden side salad to add some vitamins, but skip the croutons and dressing for a significant sodium savings. Though fries and onion rings are sodium saboteurs, you can enjoy a cup of sodium-free applesauce as a snack. For the gluten-sensitiveOur picks: Garden grilled salad with Tendergrill chicken and without croutons and with Lite honey balsamic dressing; or Whopper Jr. without bunBurger King cautions that although some of its foods may be free of gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, rye and oats, they are not intended for those with celiac disease, due to the risk of contamination. Even French fries, while gluten-free, may be fried along with gluten-containing foods. When it comes to meals without gluten, the options are pretty much limited to burgers without buns and salads without croutons and meat patties. Smoothies are available too, but they will max you out on added sugar for the entire day. We like the garden fresh salad with Tendergrill chicken (minus the croutons). The Lite honey balsamic dressing is one of the lowest-calorie dressings and is gluten-free. For the athleteOur picks: Flame-grilled chicken burger without mayo and pickles, fat-free milk or low-fat chocolate milk For those who make spin classes, jogging or going to the gym a regular part of their weekly routine, the flame-grilled chicken burger is a welcome alternative to a beef burger and offers a balanced combination of carbs and protein to fuel and repair muscles during workouts. We omitted the mayo and pickles to bring down the sodium count, though if you perspire a lot, you can afford more sodium, as some of the mineral is lost in sweat. To drink, choose low-fat milk, which offers even more protein and carbs, along with bone-building calcium. And if you are running long distances, the low-fat chocolate milk will give you even more carbs to replenish muscles. For the road warriorOur picks: Big fish sandwich, without tartar sauce and with half the bun; or Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayoIf you are on a road trip, you might be eating away from home at least for a day or two. Whether you're visiting friends, looking forward to a weekend getaway or even attending an out-of-town business conference, our guess is that you may be surrounded by high-calorie indulgences when it comes to foods and drinks. So we couldn't pass up the fish sandwich at Burger King. After all, it's rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fats and relatively low in calories and saturated fat, especially when you skip the tartar sauce. The sodium is on the higher side, but you can save some milligrams by taking off the top of the brioche bun and eating the sandwich open-faced. For longer trips, choose the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo, with 32 grams of protein to keep you satisfied and focused.For the carb-consciousOur picks: Tendergrill chicken sandwich without bun; or cheeseburger without bun; plus garden side salad with ranch dressing and without croutonsWhen you look beyond burgers, sandwiches, fries and onion rings, you won't find many low-carb options on Burger King's menu. The foods with the fewest carbs include the chicken nuggets -- a six-piece serving has 16 grams (four pieces have 11 grams) -- and the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, which also contains 16 grams of carbs, without the dressing. If you want to keep your carb consumption at a minimum, your best bet is to order the Tendergrill chicken sandwich and toss the bun. You'll save on sodium too, as the brioche bun for the chicken sandwich has more than 300 milligrams. Another low-carb option is the bun-less cheeseburger. Pair either with a garden side salad, minus the croutons, and choose the ranch dressing, which has only 2 grams of carbs per packet. For the breakfast loverOur picks: Original maple-flavored oatmeal; or egg and cheese Croissan'wichOnce you eliminate processed breakfast meats, high-sodium biscuit sandwiches and oversized portions, there isn't a whole lot to choose from on BK's breakfast menu. We like the heart-healthy maple-flavored oatmeal best because it's low in sodium and saturated fat. If you prefer more protein at breakfast, we recommend the egg and cheese Croissan'wich, though avoid adding ham, which brings the sodium count to 1,000 milligrams, as well as sausage or bacon, which boosts sodium and saturated fat. Whatever you do, skip over the ultimate breakfast platter, which appears more appropriate for a group, as it comes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, a biscuit and three pancakes. It has over a full day's worth of sodium. We also recommend avoiding the Egg-normous burrito, which has a whole day's worth of sodium and saturated fat.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/health/burger-king-menu-nutritionist/index.html"}
{"_id":"Buzz Aldrin evacuated from South Pole","articleText":" (CNN)Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the moon in 1969, has landed in Christchurch, New Zealand, after being evacuated from the South Pole when his medical condition deteriorated, according to a release from the National Science Foundation. He is 86 years old. Aldrin landed at 4:25 a.m. December 2. \"Upon arrival in Christchurch, the Antarctic program's logistics hub in New Zealand, Aldrin was transferred to a local medical facility,\" according to the foundation. He \"currently has fluid in his lungs but is responding well to antibiotics and being kept overnight for observation. His condition is stable and his manager, who is currently with him, described him being in good spirits,\" according to an update from luxury tourism company White Desert. His manager, Christina Korp, said Aldrin is recovering. She also tweeted photos showing that Aldrin reached the South Pole, which was his goal.Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station through White Desert. The trip was expected to last through December 12.A White Desert doctor and the US Antarctic Program doctor decided an evacuation would the best precautionary measure, according to a release from the company. The tourism operator made a request for a medical evacuation to the National Science Foundation today, and it agreed.Aldrin was placed on the first available flight to McMurdo Station, on the Antarctic coast. A US Antarctic Program doctor traveled with him. The science foundation uses cargo planes equipped with landing skis, called LC-130s, and they are operated by the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard.From McMurdo, another flight took Aldrin to New Zealand. Aldrin's family was notified. Earlier this week, Aldrin shared updates on his trip to the South Pole on his Instagram account.Aldrin's friend and colleague Scott Parazynski, a five-time shuttle astronaut, has participated in 19 research expeditions to the South Pole, Everest and other locations. He once oversaw healthcare for the US Antarctic Program and has assisted with telemedicine efforts there.\"Many visitors to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station have difficulty with the abrupt change in altitude -- depending on the temperature and atmospheric pressure, it can feel like 11,000 feet above sea level, where there's a dramatic reduction in the amount of oxygen in each breath,\" Parazynski said in a statement to CNN. \"High altitude-related illnesses, including Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) and less commonly High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) have been reported in new arrivals to the station, in some cases requiring medical evacuation to McMurdo Station and points north.\"While I cannot speculate on my friend and colleague Buzz Aldrin's unique situation, given that he flew from sea level to the South Pole and reportedly developed lung issues soon thereafter, moderately severe AMS or even HAPE might be the underlying cause. It sounds like they were able to MEDEVAC him to New Zealand very quickly, which is great news. When Antarctic participants develop serious illness in the middle of horrible weather, or during the long Austral winter when flights are often not possible, telemedicine has made a huge difference in many patients' care.\"White Desert specializes in Antarctic tours and has operated there for 10 years. It is a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which was founded in 1991 with the purpose of advocating private-sector travel to the Antarctic that is safe and environmentally responsible. Amundsen-Scott is one of three year-round stations operated by the National Science Foundation in Antarctica. Researchers there are studying the atmosphere and dark matter using two radio telescopes, as well as an observatory that monitors subatomic particles produced by black holes and other cosmic incidents.  Other medical evacuations have taken place in recent years at Amundsen-Scott and 850 nautical miles away at McMurdo Station. Americans have occupied the South Pole for research purposes since 1956. Amundsen-Scott was built in 1957 but has been updated and redeveloped over the years.

That's what leaders do.\"He was responding to CNN political commentator John Phillips, who supported how Trump denounced \"racism of any kind\" after an alt-right leader urged people at a Trump victory gathering to \"hail Trump\" and \"hail our people!\" Trump did not, however, condemn the alt-right directly.\"We know the political game that his opponents try to use against him, which is they want Trump's name in the same headline as these kooks,\" Phillips said.But Cuomo and CNN political commentator Christine Quinn were not satisfied with that answer.\"You don't think he would come out and denounce them the way he does anybody?\" Cuomo asked. \"He'll denounce The New York Times by name.\"\"Or the cast of 'Hamilton,'\" Quinn added.Quinn also said it isn't okay for Phillips to simply dismiss members of the alt-right as \"kooks.\"\"'Kooks' is like your aunt you're going to see at Thanksgiving... who wears a rain hat inside,\" she said. \"These people aren't kooks. They're a dangerous, racist, anti-Semitic group of people who are attacking the core values of America...

Quinn didn't give a simple yes or no, and Cuomo opted to end things there.\"You want to get a cheap political score by having somebody call him a 'bigot' or a 'racist' because that's going to go crazy in the news cycle,\" Cuomo said.\"You denounce things not just because you're looking for a label,\" he concluded. \"It doesn't matter whether or not he's a bigot.

{"_id":"CNN's Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee shortlist","articleText":"Go inside the election that changed everything: Order your copy of CNN's book \"Unprecedented,\" and explore CNN's coverage of \"A race like no other.\"  (CNN)Judicial conservatives are buzzing about a new Supreme Court justice who could cement a conservative majority on the bench for decades. President-elect Donald Trump has given a firm commitment to Republicans that he will stick to a list of 21 potential conservative nominees released during the campaign. It is a list that dazzles conservatives and includes everyone from a tweeting justice who sits on the Texas Supreme Court to an appellate judge in Alabama who has called Roe v. Wade an \"abomination.\" But conservatives have long memories. They have lived through similar situations when a nominee who might have looked good on paper turned in to a bitter disappointment, such as David Souter or even Chief Justice John Roberts, whose vote upholding Obamacare has overshadowed more conservative rulings. Here's CNN's ongoing list of potential Supreme Court nominees and what they are known for: William Pryor: Roe v. Wade = abomination Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, would be the dream candidate for many conservatives.The 54 year-old is a staunch conservative who once called the 1973 landmark abortion decision, Roe v. Wade, the \"worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\"Indeed, during his confirmation hearing after being nominated by George W. Bush, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer offered Pryor a chance to clarify his position. Pryor didn't shift. He is also no product of the Ivy League. He attended Northeast Louisiana University for his undergrad work and then graduated from Tulane University Law School in 1987. Diane Sykes: Contraceptive MandateSykes, 58, is a breath of fresh air to many conservatives, as was evidenced in her entertaining interview of Justice Clarence Thomas four years ago during a dinner sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society. The interview brought  the audience to its feet as Sykes showcased not only Thomas' commitment to his constitutional principles, but offered a glimpse of his lighter side.She is a Wisconsin native who graduated from Northwestern University in 1980 and attended Marquette University School of Law. A former journalist, Sykes went on to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and was appointed by George W. Bush to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Recently she voted to uphold Wisconsin's voter ID law. She also sided with closely held corporations in a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. Some think she might be too old at 58, others wonder if she might be a better choice for Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat should it become open. Raymond Kethledge: Kennedy clerkKethledge, who turns 50 in mid-December, is a former clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy who currently sits on the 6th Circuit. He served for one year as counsel to the Ford Motor Company.His critics worry about an anti-union opinion he issued in a case brought by public school employees. In another opinion Kethledge rejected a Fourth Amendment claim from two defendants who were convicted of several robberies based on records from their wireless carriers. Kethledge penned an opinion holding that the government's collection of business records containing cell-site data was not a search under the Fourth Amendment. Joan Larsen: Scalia clerkSome see Larsen, 48, as a dark horse, while others consider the former Scalia clerk a shoo-in for her former boss's seat.Unlike many other nominees on the list, she sits on a state court -- the Michigan Supreme Court. She has practiced and taught law, but hasn't served that long on the bench, a strike that might work against her as Republicans look for a consistent track record of conservative rulings.  Steve Colloton: DC insiderIowan Colloton, 53, a George W. Bush appointee, serves on the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.He is a product of Princeton and Yale Law School. He also is a Washington insider who has worked as a special assistant to the Attorney General in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He clerked for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist as well as Judge Laurence Silberman of the DC Circuit, a dear friend of Scalia. He served as an Associate Independent Counsel in the Office of Kenneth W. Starr from 1994-1996.When he was nominated to the federal bench, he was praised by Senator Chuck Grassley who said he would be \"extremely well qualified.\"   Neil Gorsuch: another Ivy Leaguer Gorsuch, 49, serves on the 10th Circuit. He also checks the box in the elite education category, having attended Columbia, Harvard Law and Oxford.He's been critical of judges giving too much deference to federal agencies as well as the issue of over criminalization. He is known for his commitment to originalist principles-- the underlying judicial philosophy championed by Scalia. Amul Thapar: District Court JudgeThapar, 47, serves on the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The fact that he is still a lower court judge may not be enough for those who want an appellate record. He was born in Michigan and served in government as well as private practice. He would bring trial court experience. In 2007, Thapar was the first South Asian American to be named to an Article III federal judgeship. Sen. Mike Lee: Tea party favoriteAlthough Sen. Lee of Utah has never served as a judge, judicial conservatives feel confident that he would not surprise them on the Supreme Court. He is close friends with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and Cruz endorsed Trump just after the GOP presidential nominee added Lee to his list of potential SCOTUS nominees.Lee did not support Trump, but insiders point to his commitment to his conservative principles and the fact that he clerked for Justice Samuel Alito not once but twice. His father, Rex Lee, served as the Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan, and his brother, Thomas, who serves on the Utah Supreme Court, has also been mentioned as a potential nominee.  Don Willett: The tweeting judgeWillett is a bow tie wearing tweeter with strong conservative credentials. He sits on the Texas Supreme Court. Sen. Ted Cruz posed with Willett for a recent tweet with a portrait of Ronald Reagan in the background. \"You know it's a great day when you get the chance to visit with the first official Tweeter Laureate of Texas,\" Cruz wrote. But some of Willett's tweets haven't exactly been in favor of Donald Trump. Like the time he called him \"Darth Trump.\" Willett worked for George W. Bush. David Stras: Thomas clerkStras, 42, is also a state Supreme Court justice who sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court. He is a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas and attended the University of Kansas. Like Scalia, he's served in academia and written extensively about constitutional issues and the lowercase Courts.In one book review essay, Stras weighed in on the confirmation process for federal judges. \"Amidst greater polarization in American politics, the process for nominating and confirming federal judges has become more political than ever,\" he wrote. That opinion is shared by several sitting justices.Thomas Hardiman: Cited Scalia on gun controlHardiman who serves on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has a personal story that might appeal to Trump. The 51-year-old judge was the first in his family to go to college, and for a time he drove a cab. Born in Massachusetts, he attended the University of Notre Dame undergrad and then went to Georgetown University Law Center.His judicial paper trail includes a dissent in a case where the majority upheld a New Jersey law that prohibits handgun possession without a permit. To bolster his opinion, Hardiman cited Scalia's landmark opinion in DC v. Heller. If Trump has questions about Hardiman's personality, he can always ask his own sister who also sits on the 3rd Circuit. Raymond Gruender: Contraception rulingGruender, 53, sits on the Eighth Circuit and has extensive prosecutorial experience after serving as US Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. He served as the Missouri state campaign director for Bob Dole's presidential campaign. The liberal Alliance of Justice argues that Gruender's record \"shows hostility to women's right to access reproductive care.\" They point in part to an opinion he wrote siding against female employees of Union Pacific Railroad Company whose prescription contraception was not covered by the company plan. Gruender wrote that Union Pacific's denial of coverage for contraception for both sexes did not discriminate against its female employees in violation of Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Margaret Ryan: military recordRyan, 52, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. She's a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and a former active duty marine serving as a Communications Officer, Judge Advocate and aide de camp. That gives her a background different from anyone else on the Supreme Court: she served in Desert Shield and Desert Storm.Ted Cruz: Wild cardThere are no former politicians on the court. That could change if Trump decided to ditch his list of 21 and put Cruz on the bench. Conservatives couldn't complain.Cruz is a former clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist and a darling of judicial conservatives. He's well qualified, and argued before the Court when he served as the Solicitor General of Texas. Trump might consider Cruz would kill two potential birds with one stone. He'd appoint a conservative and at the same time clear him out of the political arena. CNN's George T.

{"_id":"CNN/ORC poll: A nation divided, and is it ever","articleText":" (CNN)After a bruising presidential election featuring the two least liked major-party candidates in recent history, more than 8-in-10 Americans say the country is more deeply divided on major issues this year than in the past several years, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. And more than half say they are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in the US.The poll's findings, released Sunday, also suggest a sizable minority personally agree with both parties on at least some issues, and nearly 8-in-10 overall hope to see the GOP-controlled government incorporate some Democratic policies into its agenda. Read the complete CNN/ORC poll resultsThe public is evenly split on whether single-party control of government -- with Republicans at the helm in both the White House and Congress -- is good or bad for the country, with 49% on each side of that question. Almost 8-in-10, however, say the Republicans should make an effort to include Democratic policies in any legislation they pass rather than sticking to a GOP-driven agenda. And most say they would like to see President-elect Donald Trump, who won with an Electoral College majority despite trailing in the popular vote nationwide, pursue policies that could draw in new supporters rather than appeal solely to those who backed him during the campaign. Less than half, 40%, say that Trump's win means he has a mandate to pursue the agenda his supporters favor, while 53% say that since he didn't win the popular vote, he should get behind an agenda that might attract new supporters. The push for bipartisanship is less intense than the last time a single party controlled both houses of Congress and the White House in 2008. The percentage in the CNN/ORC poll saying Republicans ought to incorporate Democratic policies into their agenda is lower than the percentage who thought the Democrats ought to do the same in 2008 when they took control of the White House and both houses of Congress. That's largely because Republicans now are less likely to think their party's leaders ought to work with the Democrats than Democrats were in 2008 to say that their leaders should bring in GOP policies (55% of Republicans say so now vs. 74% of Democrats who said so in '08).In the wake of a surprising election night loss, Democrats express greater dissatisfaction with the way democracy in the US is working than do Republicans (63% of Democrats are dissatisfied vs. 47% of Republicans), but some of the Republican Party's core supporters express deeper dissatisfaction than the GOP as a whole.Among white evangelicals, 60% say they are dissatisfied, 62% of rural Americans say the same, and whites without college degrees, a typically GOP-leaning group which broke heavily for Trump in the recent election, are broadly dissatisfied (61% vs. 52% among whites who hold college degrees).The sense that the country is sharply riven is near universal, with 85% saying so overall, including 86% of independents, 85% of Republicans and 84% of Democrats. It's also sharply higher than it was in 2000 when the nation last elected a president who did not win the popular vote (64% thought the nation more sharply split then).The share who see deeper divides now tops 8-in-10 across gender, racial, age and educational divides. The biggest difference on the question comes across ideological lines, with 91% of liberals saying the country is more divided on top issues compared with 80% of conservatives. Still, majorities of Americans say there are at least some issues where each party, the President-elect and the current president share their views. And there is some overlap in those groups across parties. About a third of Americans (34%) say there are at least some issues where both parties share their views, though only about a quarter say they personally agree with both Trump and President Barack Obama on at least some issues. Shared views with both parties are more common among independents (43% say they share at least some views with both Democrats and Republicans, vs. 28% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans who say they agree with the opposite party on at least some issues), among men (38% say so vs. 30% of women), and among younger Americans (40% under age 45 say so, vs. 28% among older Americans).","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/politics/cnn-poll-division-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"CNN/ORC poll: Most say only turkeys will talk politics at the table","articleText":" (CNN)Americans say that this Thanksgiving they are most thankful for their family, but they really hope that Aunt Ann won't ask about politics as she passes the mashed potatoes.A new CNN/ORC poll finds that 53% of Americans say they dread the thought of talking politics over Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday.Republicans, however, are generally eager to discuss the topic with 58% on board to do so, but 63% of Democrats say they want no part of it. Overall, a minority, 43%, say they are eager to delve into politics with their stuffing.Read the resultsOf those polled, 60% who are celebrating the holiday thought it at least somewhat likely that politics would come up, including 66% of those who plan to dine at the home of a friend or family member. Among those planning to celebrate at home, fewer thought politics likely to be chewed over (54%). And younger Americans are more likely to think it'll be in the conversational mix than are seniors: 69% of those under age 45 said it was likely to come up vs. just 42% of those age 65 or older. The nation's political leaders and outcomes are at the top of very few lists of gratitude this Thanksgiving. Just 5% said they were most thankful for a political outcome or a political leader, including 4% who were most thankful for a President-elect Donald Trump.There's greater thankfulness for the nation and its rights and freedoms, however, with 13% saying they are most thankful to live in America or enjoy its freedoms. One respondent said they were most thankful \"to live in this country even though it's still divided.\"Still, Americans are most thankful for those closest to them, with 64% putting family at the top of their list. Children (9%) and spouses or significant others (6%) were most often named among those who specified a relative they're thankful for. Two percent cited their furry family members and said they were most grateful for their pets.RELATED: A very Trumpsgiving at Mar-a-LagoThe public's patterns in celebrating Thanksgiving haven't changed much in the last 10 years.Many still celebrate with relatives (43%), and though the concept of \"friendsgiving\" has grown in pop culture, there's not been a significant uptick in the share who say a gathering at a friend's place is their main event. Seven percent say they'll spend the holiday at a friend's home, about the same as the 5% who said so in 2006. More than 4 in 10 say they will eat in their own home, and 4% plan to leave the cooking to someone else entirely and dine out. Beyond family, more than a quarter said they were thankful for their health or just to be alive. And one in eight said their career, education or even ability to be retired was tops on their list this year. Friends were top of the list for 8%, as was religion. Seven percent said they were most thankful to be provided for, citing their home, ability to pay bills and support their family, or have ample food. A very grateful 3% said they were thankful for just about everything. And perhaps surprisingly, just one respondent singled out one of 2016's most memorable events: \"I'm thankful for family, friends, good health and the Cubs winning the World Series. Even though I'm not a Cubs fan.\" Interviews were conducted November 17-20, 2016 by telephone with 1,003 adult Americans","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/cnn-thanksgiving-poll/index.html"}
{"_id":"Cafe empowers acid attack survivors","articleText":" (CNN)Photographer Federico Borella was scared last year before visiting a little cafe in the northern Indian city of Agra. Not because of what he would see once he got there, but for how he -- and the people he was about to meet -- would react.But then he saw Rupa. \"When I saw Rupa for the first time, every feeling was gone immediately,\" he said. \"Because I saw in her face and in the face of the other girls -- in Ritu and Dolly -- I saw a very big smile.\"Rupa, Ritu and Dolly are some of the women who work at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe. The three of them, and the others who work there, are all survivors of acid attacks. Borella says it was less than 10 minutes after meeting the women that he found himself sitting with them in front of the cafe singing \"O sole mio\" in Italian.The cafe opened in December 2014 and was founded by Stop Acid Attacks, a New Delhi-based nonprofit. Sheroes aims to create awareness about acid attacks and to foster confidence in acid attack survivors. Borella has made several trips to the cafe for his photo series, \"Sheroes, After the Acid Attacks.\" One of the first pictures he made -- post-singing session -- is of Ritu sitting inside Sheroes. He captured the moment from behind a glass.\"It was a sort of way to start my work with caution,\" Borella said of the photo, No. 14 in the gallery above. \"In this picture, I can see Ritu thinking. She's not aware of my presence.\"Since the Italian photographer doesn't speak Hindi and the women don't speak English, they rely on someone to translate for them. But this language barrier doesn't seem to matter, Borella says, because with simple gestures and behaviors, they've managed to develop strong connections and relationships.Borella hopes his photographs raise awareness about acid attacks in India, and he wants to show survivors from a more positive perspective. One of his favorite pictures is of Rupa dancing with tourists.\"This picture for me represents what is the real mission of the Sheroes Hangout,\" he said of the fifth photo above. \"It was funny because (the tourists) asked for music. They immediately started dancing in less than five minutes. There was a sort of strong feeling between them -- the tourists -- and the rest of the girls on the left -- Dolly, Ritu and Gita.\"Borella says he gets goose bumps every time he thinks about what the women at Sheroes have been through. The reasons and motivations behind acid attacks are especially troubling to him, and they primarily target women. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in India, acid attacks result from a number of situations: family disputes, vengefulness, jealousy, mistaken identity and sex crimes, among others. Gita, for instance, was attacked by her husband out of jealousy, she said. He threw acid at her as well as at her two daughters -- Nitu, who was maimed and blinded, and Krishna, who was killed. And then there's Ritu, who was only 17 when she was attacked in the middle of the street by two men on a motorcycle. \"Every time, I think about the pure evil, in which way the human race can be very bad,\" Borella said. \"Almost every day, I'm trying to understand: Why the acid? Why? Why?\"It's not only men who attack women. Rupa's mother died when she was a child. When Rupa was 17, her stepmother thought she looked too much like her mother, so she threw acid on her face while she was sleeping.Acid attacks happen around the globe, and Borella says that in India, chemicals are pretty cheap to get. Last year, there were 249 reported acid attacks in India, according to the country's Acid Survivors Foundation. In 2013, the country's laws were reformed so that attacking someone with chemicals became punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Borella wonders whether people in the region have become used to acid attacks. He describes how, as an Italian, people always stare at him when he's in India -- yet they never seem to pay much attention when they see someone severely disfigured by an acid attack.\"When I saw that they are probably used to seeing victims of acid attacks ... I said: 'Oh my God, no. This cannot be possible,' \" Borella said. \"It's hard to believe that you are used to seeing tragedy like this.\"What Borella finds interesting is that Sheroes is not too far from the Taj Mahal. In fact, you can see the marble mausoleum in the top left corner of photo No. 2 in the gallery above, while Sheroes is delicately lit toward the bottom center. The Taj Mahal -- commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal -- is one of the reasons Agra is known as the city of love, Borella says.\"In the same area, there is almost the opposite,\" he said, referring to how acid attacks -- acts certainly not born out of love -- are the reason Sheroes came to be in the first place. \"It's something like black and white, night and day.\"Despite this, there seems to be a lot of love at Sheroes -- from the people who created it to the women who work there to the customers who visit it. The cafe has become a place where survivors can be comfortable, a place where they can remove the veils they may have once felt the need to cover themselves with.After an attack, Borella says, many of the women would be afraid to show their faces in public, for fear of people staring at their scars and the discrimination they would face. \"I understood that with the help of the Sheroes Hangout NGO, they are not afraid anymore,\" Borella said. \"They are confident. They are not scared in front of the foreigners, in front of the customers, in front of the local people.\" He recalls one moment in particular that he had with Dolly. At 12 years old, Dolly was attacked while trying to defend her sister from a neighbor's unwanted advances. Borella says he asked her for a picture of her before the attack, which can be seen on the right in photo No. 12. \"When Dolly (gave) me her picture, I was crying,\" Borella said. \"My reaction was immediately very strong, very, very strong. She noticed it, and she said: 'Federico, don't worry. I am happy right now.' \"Federico Borella is an Italian photographer based in Bologna, Italy.

{"_id":"Calf bones help in search for 1620 Plymouth settlement","articleText":" (CNN)The discovery of a calf's remains, 17th-century pottery, musket balls and trade beads has led University of Massachusetts Boston researchers to believe they have located the elusive 1620 Plymouth settlement where the Pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving. The evidence was found at an archaeological site on Burial Hill in Plymouth, which is believed to be the location of the first Pilgrim settlement, according to a report on the university's website. The settlement's exact location has long eluded precise identification.Dr. Kathryn Ness, curator at the Plimoth Plantation museum, told CNN the discovery represents the first physical evidence of the early 400-year-old settlement.\"While there have been different excavations, it's kind of tricky because [the site] is in the middle of downtown Plymouth. So it makes it hard for archaeologists to excavate and where they're digging is right on the edge of a cemetery,\" Ness said.The project is a collaboration of the university's Andrew Fiske Memorial Center for Archaeological Research, the Plimoth Plantation and the Institute for New England Native American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston.David Landon, associate director of the Fiske Center, and his students have spent five weeks every summer since 2013 looking for evidence of the original settlement.Landon's goal was to find evidence before 2020, the 400th anniversary of the founding of the colony, according to UMass Boston statement.\"While we're digging, we're constantly in the process of trying to interpret what we're finding,\" Landon said.  \"It's about much more than the artifacts -- it's about trying to pin down soil color and trying to understand constructed features that are no longer there.\"The researchers could not search for typical building foundations because the structures from the original settlement were not built with bricks, according to the statement.The Pilgrims used \"post and ground construction,\" a system of vertical wooden posts planted directly into the ground. To find the settlement, the team had to locate holes for wood and dirt, the statement said.  It wasn't until the team found the calf, which was named Constance by the students, that Landon said he felt he had definitely found the settlement.Native people did not have domestic cattle, according to Landon. He concluded that the calf lived, died and was buried within the walls of the first settlement.\"Oftentimes success in the colony depended on herds of cattle,\" he said. \"It became a centerpiece of the economy. So the calf does connect us to that story.\"The team will return next summer to continue its research.CNN's Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/us/plymouth-settlement-evidence-found/index.html"}
{"_id":"Can Europe survive the Trump effect?","articleText":" (CNN)As President Obama, comfortably aboard Air Force One, went wheels up from Berlin Friday, he left behind not just a cold and damp Germany, but a gloomy Europe.His departure ends a period where allies have been able to look across the Atlantic at one another and see themselves more or less reflected back.President-elect Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric and subsequent election victory has smashed that mirror.What really draws down the darkening for Europe's leaders, however, is the realization that there are plenty of other European politicians ready to remake their own image in Trump's.They want the mirror effect to work for them, so that their visions can win.They are not just on the right, like Marine Le Pen of France's National Front, who predicts Trump's victory will translate to gains for her in the upcoming French presidential elections, but also leftists like Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece, even though neither rooted for a Trump victory.They all think they can profit from Trump's populist message by similarly tapping into frustrations, anger and nationalist agendas.If Europe's leaders had thought that Brexit was an aberration and dealing with a recalcitrant UK in the form of a determined British Prime Minister Theresa May was a one-off, Obama's somewhat forlorn and chastened farewell tour would have brought the reality of their own vulnerabilities crashing home.Matteo Renzi, Italy's young and charismatic Prime Minister, sat to Obama's right at his farewell roundtable in Berlin, displacing May, who might once have expected to take that prestigious position. The Italian will have been fully aware he faces his own denouement at the hands of populists buoyed by Trump's victory.Renzi has called a referendum to push for needed political reforms. That referendum has since morphed into a vote on him, and he has said that he'll quit should the vote go the wrong way.Presidential elections taking place in Austria in a few weeks -- the same day as Renzi's referendum -- could also point to a \"Trump effect.\" The Austrians currently seem set to hand victory to Norbert Hofer, a nationalist who used Trump-style rhetoric of rigged elections to force the last ballot to be canceled before it was even held. Among other things, he has been trading on fears of migrants.Also at the table with Obama in Berlin was French President François Hollande, who knows his current approval rating is so low that he is now unlikely to be his party's pick to represent them in the French presidential elections next year. Already, pollsters are tipping Le Pen as a favorite in the first round of voting, and will only be defeated if left and center right join forces in the second round.The mood at the table, aside perhaps from May's, must have been stark. Obama is aware that much that he holds dear could be lost.Trump has openly criticized the transatlantic relationship, questioning NATO's relevance, and has praised Britain's decision to leave the EU.For many of Europe's leaders, the fear is that this winter may be a long one. Not perhaps of Shakespearian proportions heralded in the opening lines of \"Richard III,\" but nevertheless, one of significant discontent.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/europe/trump-ripple-effect-europe-nic-robertson/index.html"}
{"_id":"Can forgotten rubella children of the '60s hold clue for Zika babies?","articleText":"Brooklyn, New York (CNN)One side of the bedroom is an explosion of pink, from the hair accessories and dangling trinkets to the stuffed animals and laundry hamper. The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She's 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they've lived together for about 45 years.What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers' wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions. Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who'll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.Hoping for the bestFlorence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the rubella virus helped make abortion legal. But abortion wasn't an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she'd be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced. \"Oh, that's wonderful. That'll be OK. We could fix that,\" Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. \"And then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.\"Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-'60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kim \"looked different,\" Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn't hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she'd never walk or be toilet trained. But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital. Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor's help, she found hope. Desperate for answersCooper was a medical student in the 1950s when Jonas Salk developed the first successful polio vaccine. That discovery ignited a new sort of excitement about the field the aspiring doctor was entering. \"It proved we could keep people healthy,\" he says. He wanted in on that euphoria and, after completing his military service, pursued a fellowship to work on a vaccine for staph infections. But then a friend isolated the rubella virus, not long before the epidemic started in the United States. Cooper turned his focus toward rubella.While scrambling to develop a rubella vaccine, he and others became overwhelmed by what pregnant women were experiencing. Mothers, with heir babies in their arms, began showing up in Cooper's Bellevue Hospital lab, desperate for assistance and answers. \"My temperament is not just to do research on people; you have to serve them,\" Cooper says. \"And so the Rubella Project was created to help these families.\"That's how Cooper, a trained internist, transitioned into becoming a pediatrician. He assembled a core team of 25 people, including doctors, social workers, educators and therapists. With more than 300 congenital rubella syndrome children in their care -- and hundreds of other families looking for guidance -- the team set out to give them a chance in life. A search for independenceThere were schools for the deaf. There were schools for the blind. There were programs for the \"mentally retarded,\" as they were known in the 1960s. But schools for all of the above -- and then some? There was nothing like that.The most severely disabled children with congenital rubella syndrome were often destined for a lifetime of institutionalization. So were those whose parents couldn't bear this kind of child-rearing responsibility or couldn't find an alternative.Cooper and his team believed they could do better by these kids and their families. One of the educators on his team -- whom he'd later marry -- ran the Rubella Project preschool to help children like Kim get started. Cooper also lobbied hard to expand the scope of specialized schools and earn entry and adequate resources for his young patients and the people caring for them. \"You didn't have to say a lot,\" Cooper remembers of his visits to lawmakers, policy leaders and education officials. \"You just had to show them the pictures and describe the disruption to families.\" He watched families fall apart. Kim's family clung together, but still they were tested. Kim is legally blind, completely deaf and nonverbal. A heart defect required surgery in her early years. She's intellectually disabled and has behavior disorders, as well as obsessive compulsive and autistic tendencies. More and more, as she's aged, she suffers from mobility issues and often relies on a walker.At first, teaching Kim seemed impossible. First glints of progress appeared while she was in the Rubella Project preschool. Then when she was almost 6, thanks to Cooper's advocacy, Kim, Darvena and a small group of others headed off to the Bronx to attend what was then the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind. At the state-run school, where she lived Mondays through Fridays for the next 16 years, the instructors managed to do things for Kim her family couldn't accomplish. She began to read, write and sign. She learned to ride a horse, row a boat and use a toilet. She found, in the safety of her school community and living with peers, a sort of peace.The family learned sign language, but still, when Kim was home on weekends or breaks -- by then, the family had moved to Staten Island -- she was enormously difficult. \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody with what she was like,\" her mother says. \"There are not a lot of happy memories.\" Kim could not be disciplined or managed. She was an escape artist who figured out every lock they put on the front door. When she was about 6, police officers showed up in the middle of a winter night with Kim. She'd been spotted walking down the road barefoot, wearing only a nightgown. Another time she strolled into a neighbor's kitchen at 2 a.m., looking for ice cream. A third time she barged into an Orthodox Jewish home in the middle of a religious service. On car rides, she'd throw things out the window, strip naked or try to get out while the car was moving. The family learned to suspend their Christmas tree from the ceiling because otherwise she'd knock it over. If a light was broken in a restaurant, she'd freak out, which meant on the rare occasions when the family dared to eat out, they'd first have to case the place to make sure it was \"safe.\"Her frustrations would sometimes bubble over into rage -- and, at times, violence. Making matters worse, her tolerance for pain was otherworldly. Three times in one month, when she was 8, she crashed her head through a window in the family's home. By the third visit to the ER, Florence feared she and her husband would be accused of abuse.Florence, who had a total of five children, absorbed the brunt of Kim's anger. Kim was smart enough to know she was different from her siblings, and in her limited understanding, mothers were supposed to fix things. Kim would motion to her ears and demand that they work. She blamed Florence when they didn't. Kim pushed, hit and tossed her mother around. She didn't know her own strength. Her three brothers wouldn't invite friends over when Kim was around. They feared she might embarrass them by taking off all her clothes. Jill Taylor, Kim's younger sister by 15 months, shared a room with Kim when she was home. As the older sister, Kim struggled to understand why Jill was taller, had friends and got to drive. A couple of times Kim stole car keys and had to be stopped before trying to take the wheel herself.She, too, wanted to be independent.Jill's heart breaks when she thinks about what her parents went through -- and what Kim's future might have looked like if not for congenital rubella syndrome. As a little girl, Kim used to open up encyclopedias and stare at medical entries. Jill is sure her sister would have been the brains of the bunch.\"You can't help but wonder,\" Jill says through tears. \"What would Kim have been?\"The best life possibleWhile she was in school, Kim's family took solace, knowing she was cared for, calmer and being given the best life possible. As she approached graduation at 22, they worried: What was supposed to happen next? Moving Kim home full-time was a terrifying proposition, and it wasn't what she wanted, either. From the moment Kim donned her blue cap and gown, she sobbed the entire day. She didn't want to leave. The Woodford family was not alone in needing a plan. They banded together with other families whose children were aging out of the system.  Cooper's example, and years of raising children with congenital rubella syndrome, taught them how to fight for services. In 1983, these parent-activists in the New York metro area established Advocates for Services for the Blind Multihandicapped, a private nonprofit agency to develop small group homes where their children could live and age with dignity. Today, the organization runs six residential programs in the Bronx and Brooklyn serving 53 individuals, 22 of them with congenital rubella syndrome.'This is your  home'Kim eats too fast and needs someone to watch her during meals so she won't choke. She clenches her fists and smacks them against her mouth when she becomes agitated. Her cupboard holds cake mixes and frostings, as she loves to bake -- but is less keen on sharing. She can't start her day without a cup of coffee, which she makes scalding hot with heaping spoonfuls of sugar.Darvena loads every game app she can find onto her smartphone, but she only likes to play bowling. Like clockwork, every weekday late afternoon, she can be found on the couch watching her soap operas. No one believes she understands the storylines, but the ritual comforts her. It reminds her of time she used to spend beside her mother, who religiously watched these same shows. When the two play a children's card game, Darvena knows to reach out and wave her hand to remind Kim when it's her turn. Always near in their first-floor Brooklyn home is Michael Blake, who these two have grown up with since the 1960s. He sits before his laptop, playing \"Wheel of Fortune.\" He might guess random letters, but mainly he just likes hitting the button to spin the wheel. Beside him is his growing collection of key chains. He likes to relax on his bed with his headset on; he can't hear the music but enjoys the vibration.Along with a fourth, more recent addition, they are family. They respect each other's space. They vacation together, go to Broadway shows and enjoy the same recreational activities. Bowling is a favorite.Five people who are less independent live on the floor above. Of the nine residents here, seven have congenital rubella syndrome. They have 24/7 help, including staff who are also deaf, to manage residents' schedules and medicines and attend to their needs -- helping them be as independent as possible.\"We come into their home as guests who are here to support them,\" explains Nick Hassan, the coordinator for Advocates for Services for the Blind Multihandicapped in Brooklyn. \"We make sure that they know, 'This is your home, and you decide how it works.'\" Part of their jobs is making sure the residents get where they need to go each day. \"To me, there's nothing wrong with them,\" says Tanya Rodriguez, the residence manager. \"They've overcome what wasn't expected of them. I just want people to see them the way I see them.\" Michael looks at his watch, anxious for his ride to Kohl's department store. He's worked there for years, doing jobs that include tagging jeans. Kim and Darvena aren't employed, but they go to other day programs that keep them busy. What they deserveThe Woodfords visit Kim and her housemates regularly, but not every resident of these group homes is so lucky. Parents who are still alive are in their twilight years. Some have moved away or are otherwise physically unable to visit. Having Kim there means the world to Florence, who, despite the difficulties, says her daughter has been her greatest life teacher. Kim has taught the family perseverance, patience, unconditional love and kindness no matter life's adversities. The journey also has given Florence a mission -- to make sure her daughter, and others like her, get what they deserve.\"It's a tremendous source of comfort,\" she says of Kim's home. \"It means she has a better life, that we have a better life. ... She is always on the move. It's given her a lot of freedom.\"The day will come, though, when Kim and her housemates won't be as active. What will happen when they're not able to spend as much time out in the community? In coming years, how will their needs change?\"It's always a fight to keep funding now,\" says Jill, Kim's sister, who is the vice president of the agency behind these group homes. \"We're just starting to think about when they age.\"What Zika babies needWhat Kim, her peers and their families have been up against the past 50 years may foreshadow what's in store for babies born with the effects of the Zika virus.\"It's not just when they're babies. What's going to be there for them? Do they have a support system in place?\" asks Jill. \"Are there going to be the right kind of people to teach them? How teachable will they be? It's all a big question mark. It's frightening, and it's just so devastatingly sad.\" These are the same questions Cooper, 84, hopes communities and politicians are asking. The fact that US lawmakers are still squabbling over emergency Zika funding frustrates him beyond measure.\"Congress needs to stop fooling around,\" he says. \"Every day we fail to put resources to work means more misery.\" The families he came to know in the New York area found power in numbers, were unique in their activism and benefited from resources available in a big city. He can't imagine what life would have looked like for his former patients if they'd been born in rural America or, say, a remote area of Brazil. \"We're just learning what the Zika babies are going to need, but what's clear is they're going to need a lot and they're going to need it for a long time,\" he says. \"And their families are going to need even more. ... The stress is enormous.\"The clock is ticking to mobilize on behalf of those babies and their families. The best he and those he's helped over the years can do, they say, is sound the alarm: It's time to wake up.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html"}

{"_id":"Cancer immunotherapy trial stopped again after 2 more deaths","articleText":" (CNN)After more patient deaths, Juno Therapeutics announced Wednesday that it is voluntarily putting its \"ROCKET\" trial on hold for the second time this year. The patients enrolled in this Phase II trial are adults with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, according to the biopharmaceutical company's website.\"We took this action after two additional patients in this trial experienced cerebral edema earlier this week,\" Juno CEO Hans Bishop said on a conference call this morning. One patient died Tuesday, and another died earlier Wednesday.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer that can spread quickly through the body and, if left untreated, can be fatal within months. Cerebral edema is brain swelling caused by excess fluid inside the skull.In July, the trial was put on a clinical hold at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration. At that time, the company revealed three patient deaths, also the result of cerebral edema. According to Bishop, investigators pinpointed the likely culprit as the addition of fludarabine to the pre-conditioning regimen. Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used here as a one-time primer for treatment, used in an effort to increase the effectiveness of the experimental therapy.In this particular course of treatment, pre-conditioning consists of a heavy dose of chemotherapy to kill off existing cancer cells in order to give the new cancer-killing T-cells room to grow. It's like hitting a reset button to restart the immune system. But an unforeseen interaction between fludarabine and genetically modified JCAR015 cells proved to be lethal.After petitioning the FDA, Juno was permitted to continue the trial without the use of fludarabine. In August, the trial resumed, and 12 patients have been treated since, said Juno Chief Medical Officer Mark Gilbert on Wednesday. This includes the two patients who died this week after being treated last week.The FDA monitors all US drug trials and says fatal adverse events are \"extremely rare.\"Immunotherapy has been heralded as the new frontier in the war on cancer. It works by harnessing the body's immune system to fight cancer from within. But many of these cutting-edge treatments are still in the experimentation phase. A Phase II clinical trial is designed to test the effectiveness of a new drug or treatment. It typically follows a Phase I trial, which evaluates safety and side effects. Before a new drug or treatment goes to market, it must also pass through a Phase III trial, as outlined by the National Institutes of Health.\"Going forward, all options remain on the table for JCAR015,\" Bishop said Wednesday. \"The options include, among others: moving forward with JCAR015 in the current study under a modified protocol, beginning a new study or terminating the program.\"Juno's other ongoing trials, including JCAR017 cells, are not affected, according to the company.\"Any decision on how to move forward will of course need to be made, taking into account feedback from the FDA and our (Data and Safety Monitoring Board), as well as the treating physicians in the trial,\" Bishop said. He added that the patients in this trial often have no other options.Bishop said the company plans to provide a more thorough update in the next few weeks.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/juno-stops-cancer-immunotherapy-trial-again/index.html"}

But a new class of high-powered superfoods is pushing the envelope even further, making even the healthiest among us stop and do a double take. For starters, there's Gwyneth's pricy morning smoothie ritual (whose ingredient shopping list totals $200 thanks to so-called \"moon dust\"). And then there's something called Blue Majik and ... astrologically farmed eggs?\"We're always looking for a quick fix, miracle ingredient or drug to cure our issues and make us healthier,\" says Isabel Smith, MS, RD, CDN and Founder of Isabel Smith Nutrition. \"When we find something that sounds almost too crazy to be true, we assume it's the next miracle worker and hop on board.\" But not so fast, she says. \"It's always important to understand fully what we're putting into our bodies before we do so.\"Find out if these hot health trends (and often hefty price tags) can live up to their claims.Rainbow Bagels, Ramen Tacos: 2016's Unhealthiest Food Trends5 Crazy New Health Food Trends1. Astrologically Farmed EggsYes, this is a thing, thanks to London's uber cool Hemsley sisters. It's the next step in biodynamic farming, where crops are planted based on the phase of the moon -- and on 100 percent ethical, self-sufficient land. Think organic -- x 100. For eggs, farmers use a moon almanac to birth healthier chickens, which supposedly lay super delicious eggs. But is all the extra hands-on attention worth it (and the extra 15 cents per egg)?\"Not using hormones or antibiotics in the process of growing chickens is definitely beneficial, but it may not differ from other organic methods,\" says Smith. \"No research really exists on this.\" While Smith notes that eggs are a good source of protein and nutrients like lutein, which may prevent age-related macular degeneration, you don't have to pay the astronomical price for these star-crossed eggs.The Dirty Dozen: What to Buy Organic2. Blue MajikBlue wine isn't the only trendy blue food. Blue Majik is making its debut in everything from protein shakes to juice (like Juice Generation's $10 \"Holy Water,\" complete with the blue-green algae) to blue (aka smurf) lattes. It claims to reduce inflammation and support healthy joints.\"This is basically spirulina, which is a source of chlorophyll, energizing B vitamins and iron,\" says Smith. According to Smith, chlorophyll also includes nutrients like vitamins A and C and magnesium. \"[Blue majik] contains a compound called phycocyanin, which may also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but research has been done widely in mice.\" At $60 for 30 single packets, you might be better off sticking with your regular microalgae supplement.The 7 All-Time Worst Iced Coffee Orders3. CordycepsThere are plenty of magic mushrooms on the market, but this fungus that grows on caterpillar larva is the latest 'It' 'shroom (and an ingredient in Gwyneth Paltrow's morning smoothie). Advocates claim the fungus helps with oxygen uptake, stamina (on the field and in the bedroom) and recovery — not to mention boasts anti-cancer properties. Sounds pretty great, right?Aside from its long use in Traditional Chinese Medicine, there isn't really much science to back it up. \"No research in humans has found any improvement in trained athletes,\" says Smith. A study from Brigham Young University found that it did not improve performance in trained cyclists. As for the cancer and libido claims? Most research has been done in animals, not humans. Given its high price tag ($30 for 2.4 ounces), you can probably pass on this one.4. AshwagandhaYes, it's a mouthful, but the adaptogenic herb — aka Indian Ginseng — has been touted for everything from lowering cortisol levels to balancing thyroid hormones to fighting cancer. And yes, it's also an ingredient in Gwyneth's morning elixir. You can take it in capsule form or a bit of the powder or tincture to your daily juice or smoothie.According to Smith, the herb has been used in Ayurveda and in many cultures for many years. \"There has been some research that suggests that Ashwaganda may be beneficial in the areas of boosting immunity, joint health, adrenal gland support and hormone balance,\" she says. \"But more research in humans is needed.\" If you choose to try it, remember it's a powerful herb and may interact with other medications or herbs you may be taking. \"Be sure to be in touch with your medical provider when taking it,\" says Smith.5. CannabisEver since marijuana has gained favor in the medical community, it's been shooting for superherb status. It's been touted to improve athletic performance, relieve pain (including PMS symptoms) and reduce anxiety. Now, MJ is being added to edibles too -- and we're not just talking about pot brownies here. You'll find cannabis-infused into coconut oil, teas and even canna-butter. Proponents also claim that it will help you detox. (Yes, there really is a cannabis cleanse. [PDF])The tales of weed's healing powers just may have some weight. Studies have shown that the herb may reduce inflammation. Smith says that one of the compounds in cannabis closely resembles the body's natural endocannabinoids, which may mediate pain and provide PMS relief while suppressing headaches and helping with insomnia too. Research has also shown that marijuana may improve airflow (PDF) to lungs by acting as a bronchiodialator. (Ironic, we know.) As for those detox claims? More research is needed.

It was well-timed victory for Trump, who also rolled out his economic team, tapping Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary and billionaire Wilbur Ross to head the Department of Commerce. Both Mnuchin and Ross come with public relations warts -- including Mnuchin's time as a Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager and Ross' \"king of bankruptcy\" nickname. But in securing a deal with Carrier, Trump is lending credibility to his claims that he'd put people he'd called \"killers\" -- meant as a compliment -- to help American workers. The details of the Carrier deal remain obscure. Trump's campaign has deflected questions on exactly how the company was convinced to stay in Indiana -- pointing reporters to the company and its much larger parent, United Technologies. The fate of Carrier's plant in Huntington, Indiana, which employed 700, is also unclear.Carrier released a few more details later Wednesday in a statement.\"The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration\" to staying, Carrier said, though the company didn't specify what the incentives were. And while Trump's campaign pledges to lower corporate taxes and ease regulations likely played a role, it was not Trump -- but Vice President-elect Mike Pence -- who was key to Carrier's decision. His status as Indiana's governor positioned him to offer Carrier tax breaks to stay in the state. It's not a new strategy: State and local governments offer companies tax incentives to locate, expand or remain there all the time. In fact, Pence's Indiana Economic Development Corp. has faced sharp criticism for handing millions of dollars to companies that sent jobs overseas even after receiving those tax breaks. Trump himself had even blasted the practice on the campaign trail, including in October remarks in Pennsylvania. \"I've been watching these politicians go through this for years. I've been watching them give low-interest loans. I've been watching them give zero interest loans,\" Trump said in Wilkes Barre, later adding that \"the whole thing is crazy.\" He made a similar case in Erie, Pennsylvania, in August. \"Our states -- I watched. Remember, they'd give the low-interest loans,\" Trump said, mocking state officials for handing out tax incentives. \"'Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania. Here's a zero-interest loan. You don't have to pay. Here's a this. Here's a tax abatement of any kind you want. We'll help your employees,'\" he said. \"It doesn't work, folks.\"In Carrier's case, it does appear to have worked. It's the second time Trump has claimed credit for a company's decision to keep jobs in the United States. But when a Ford plant in Louisville, Kentucky, said it would not produce a sport-utility vehicle in Mexico, the decision was a facade in terms of Trump's involvement: No jobs were on the line, and none were saved.Trump's strategy with Carrier might not be an exact model for his broader trade and manufacturing efforts. For one, it puts states and municipalities at risk of facing threats from other manufacturers that they'd leave unless offered major tax breaks of their own. Subsidizing businesses is also a practice protectionists in the United States have long decried from foreign governments including China, and risks provoking a trade war. Trump's broader strategy appears to be his promise to cut taxes and make it easier for companies to shift profits earned overseas back into the United States. On the campaign trail, he has also threatened companies that manufacture goods in foreign countries with stiff tariffs -- the types eliminated through trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. But his willingness to use government incentives as muscle in negotiations offers a preview of how Trump might handle similar situations in the coming years. \"The President-elect and the Vice President(-elect) picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here. Can't remember the last time a president did that,\" Mnuchin told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby Wednesday.United Technologies -- Carrier's parent company -- earns about 10% of its income through federal contracts for products including engines for F-35 fighter jets. If tax breaks are Trump's carrot, the threat of losing government contracts -- risky as it is when national security-related products are involved -- could be his stick.

{"_id":"Cat yoga: The mewest exercise trend","articleText":" (CNN)Lined up one by one behind a glass door, tiny black fuzzy heads peer out at a forbidden Nirvana. They stare at a privilege only the older and wiser among them get to experience. Just out of reach is a sea of sweet, spongy goodness: fresh, unclawed yoga mats.Typically, the Good Mews cat shelter in Marietta, an Atlanta suburb, with its bright walls and white volunteer-scrubbed floors, is home to 100 or so cats who lounge and chase and bat at the odd toy, all while they wait for humans to come find them and give them a forever home.Tonight, however, they are in for something special. Tonight, their home in the cage-free adult cat room transforms into a studio for the ultimate in challenging exercise fads. Classes have popped up on New York's Lower East Side, in San Francisco, even in Des Moines and in Mobile, Alabama.Tonight, it's yoga with cats.If you've ever tried a hero's pose with your cat around, you know the challenge has nothing to do with your breathing or flexibility. The Herculean task is keeping your yoga mat feline-free. Whatever they make yoga mats out of, the material must come from the catnip family. Turn your back just once to grab your water bottle, and you'll instantly hear the pop, pop, pop of their claws on your pristine $70 Lululemon. On this night, however, a group of about 15 Spandex-clad women have deliberately plunked down their mats in the middle of the cat room. And true to form, the sleeping cats that had been lounging -- furry legs dangling from cat trees around the room -- instantly jolt awake. They start climbing down toward their prey.One of the shelter managers, along with a longtime volunteer who is a certified yoga instructor, got the idea for the class -- where else -- after seeing a cat video on the Internet. Only, in that case, people brought cats to a yoga studio.\"I thought with people with allergies, it might be hard to clean up the studio afterward, so I thought, why not bring the class to the shelter?\" said the instructor, Lisa Bass. The manager of the shelter, Lisa Johns, thought it was a great idea. She'd wanted another way to get people into the shelter to see the adoptable animals. With Bass donating her time, the class participation fee becomes a donation to help support the animals. Besides the usual assortment of cats and kittens, the shelter runs an expensive program that places cats with special medical needs, continuing to pay for their care even after they've left the shelter. The class has been a huge hit. It sells out almost as soon as the times are announced online three times a month. \"I really like the class and really like hanging out with all the cats,\" said Katie Misencik, a volunteer and regular yoga practitioner. Misencik has taken other theme yoga classes, including one that involves beer, but she says the cat class is pretty special. \"It's all about fun and is a little more relaxing,\" she said. \"There's not as much pressure to make my form perfect.\"Studies show that yoga can improve your balance, your breathing, your sense of self and your overall health. It can reduce anxiety and fight off depression. It strengthens your core and can help ease chronic pain.There are no studies about the health benefits of cat yoga, but Bass does see a difference in her students after they've shared their practice with a tiger cat. \"In general, yoga is great for lowering the heart rate, and it's great for flexibility,\" Bass said. \"Cat yoga is good for your soul.\"From the happy looks on the women's faces, the class does seem to be a hit -- even if, collectively, they may suffer a little from what Bass calls CADD, or cat attention deficit disorder. But even the most senior of yogis might struggle in a room with such present creatures. As soon as the soothing music starts, cats do make a beeline for the students and the yoga mats.A calico wanders through a woman's legs as she tries to balance in a low lunge. A white cat sniffs and rubs against a woman in cow pose as she instantly becomes a kind of cat jungle gym. One nestles into the discarded jacket next to a woman's mat.Two tabbies gang up and attack a woman's long dangling ponytail as she attempts downward dog, or \"downward cat,\" as the instructor calls it. A tuxedo perched high in a cat tree looks down at another woman, a little judgy at her attempt at a cat pose. To a person, each woman laughs at these antics. Some even dangle fuzzy toys as they make their complicated moves. The cats seem to like the attention.\"They get stimulation from the humans,\" said Johns, the manager. \"They are very curious about what is going on. They get a lot of loving and affection and get more socialization.\" Johns also thinks the humans benefit from the special kind of happiness you can only feel bonding with a cat. \"You're not just doing something healthy for yourself,\" Johns said. \"You are doing a bit of good too for these shelter cats that will only get even more adoptable with the extra time and attention.\"Namaste.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/cat-yoga/index.html"}

{"_id":"Chandeliers, marble and propaganda: Inside North Korea's metro system","articleText":" (CNN)Buried 100 meters (328 feet) underground, the Pyongyang Metro is one of the deepest commuter systems in the world. It's also one of the world's most mysterious. Only a few thousand tourists enter the Democratic People's Republic of Korea each year. Visits are only granted through specific tour groups, itineraries are heavily planned by tour guides, and certain areas are strictly off limits, so everyday life in North Korea is often hidden from outsiders. Read: World's creepiest underground marvelsBut when 25-year-old photographer Elaine Li made her first trip to the North Korea's capital in October, what struck her most was the sense of familiarity. Born and raised in Hong Kong, Li is no stranger to city life. Her portfolio -- largely filled with images of skyscrapers, traffic jams and amusing commutes -- has built the young photographer a following of over 133,000 on Instagram. While schools, restaurants and city landmarks were all on her itinerary, it was a ride in the subway that felt closest to home. She spoke to CNN Style about the experience. CNN: What were your first impressions of the Pyongyang Metro? Elaine Li: The first thing I noticed was that, although the stations are very dimly lit, the interiors are very fancy. You see chandeliers on the ceilings, marble pillars and paintings of Kim Jong Il. The next thing I noticed was the newspaper stands that are on display across the platform itself -- you'll see people standing around and reading them. Read: Why Pyongyang is the perfect science fiction setThis was all very interesting to me because, in cosmopolitan cities like Hong Kong, we are bombarded with advertising. In Pyongyang, they are bombarded with propaganda. Were you given any restrictions when photographing the subway?In general I had no issues getting permission to take photographs on the trains or stations. The tour guides accompanied us for the whole commute, but on the platform we were free to roam around. As for traveling on the train itself, we were only allowed to travel for a few stops, and only got off at certain stations. The only restriction was that we were not allowed to take photographs from inside the tunnels, I am not sure why.Read: Beneath the surface of North KoreaWhat was it like on the trains? The first thing I noticed was how quiet it was. It seemed so tame -- no one was saying anything -- and perhaps could even be described as a little lifeless. But then I came back to the subway in Hong Kong and I realized ... people here lack communication as well. Even though the Hong Kong trains are louder and it seems more lively at first, the reality is that commuters here do not communicate. They are glued to their smartphones. In Pyongyang I did see some people on their smartphones, but far fewer.Instead they were looking around, seemed almost shy, but not really talking to each other either. I realized that, in a way, this commute was just like commutes in so many other Asian cities. Did you interact with any commuters? At one point I almost missed my train because I was taking a picture of a female conductor while the rest of my tour group was on the train -- and the door slammed shut. The conductor I was photographing then whistled to the train driver, indicating that he should open the door and let me on. Another interaction was with an elderly man. I wanted to give him my seat so patted him on the shoulder, but at first he didn't understand. So another lady communicated to him that I wanted to give him my seat. Read: A look beyond Hong Kong's postcard exteriorThese interactions were definitely the most interesting parts of my journey. They were so small but felt so human. It reminded me that wherever we are, we all have these common human interests, such as taking care of our elderly. What has the response been to your photography? It's been very heavily mixed. Some people say these images are eye opening, and show a side to the country that they don't usually get to see. Others ask why I would ever go to North Korea in the first place, then claim my images are propaganda and that I'm sponsored by North Korea. Read: Take a 3D Tour of North KoreaThe preconceptions that people have were really reflected on the comments I've received. But I just wanted to document what was in front of me, and share what I experienced as honestly as possible.

{"_id":"Chattanooga bus crash: 6 children dead; Titans to help victims' families","articleText":"Chattanooga, Tennessee (CNN)While the rest of the country gives thanks Thursday, six Chattanooga families are grieving the absence of a child from their table. Keonte Wilson. Cor'Dayja Jones. Zyaira Mateen. D'Myunn Brown. Zoie Nash. Zyanna Harris. All six perished after their school bus crashed and flipped over, leading to intense scrutiny over the driver's actions and safety record. Nine-year-old Cor'Dayja Jones' family was looking forward to celebrating not just Thanksgiving with her, but also her upcoming 10th birthday on December 11. \"One of the things that I remember about Cor'Dayja was that she always smiled, and she would always give you a hug,\" her cousin LaFrederick Thirkill told CNN on Thursday. But on this day of grace, both Thirkill and the family of bus driver Johnthony Walker are also heartbroken for one another. \"I pray for his family as well as I do (for) mine and the other families that were involved in this terrible accident,\" Thirkill said.  After Monday's crash, Walker's sister called Thirkill, the principal of a neighboring elementary school.  \"She has students who attend my school as well, and so she called, very emotional and obviously grieving,\" Thirkill recalled. \"She just reassured me that her brother was a good person and she said that he was terribly heartbroken by the accident. She said that he was driving and he hit a curb or something and he tried to overcorrect the bus, and caused it to flip over.\" Sixth child diesEight-year-old Keonte Wilson, who was seriously injured in the crash, \"was a tough little boy\" and put up a valiant fight for two days in the hospital, his brother Kevin McClendon told CNN. But on Wednesday, he became the sixth child to die. \"I know he's in a better place,\" McClendon said.Who were the Chattanooga bus crash victims? More than a dozen other students were injured -- some with severe head or spinal injuries. And because some of the victims were so young, many of them didn't know their parents' names or phone numbers -- leading to massive confusion at the hospital and hours of anxiety for parents waiting to know whether their child was dead or alive. Help from near and far A flood of good Samaritans, ranging from the NFL's Tennessee Titans to strangers in Ohio, have rallied to help families of those killed and wounded. The Titans will donate $25,000 to The Woodmore Fund, benefiting Woodmore Elementary School families affected by the crash. The players will also wear \"W.E.S.\" decals on their helmets when they play the Chicago Bears on Sunday. And in Chattanooga, throngs of residents lined up for hours to donate blood to the wounded victims. Those with desperately needed O-negative blood got fast-tracked. And amid the scramble to save victims at Children's Hospital at Erlanger, pediatric surgeon Dr. Lisa Smith said strangers have donated teddy bears, money and even pizzas ordered by people as far away as Ohio. Bus driver crashed twice in two months As the community mourns, investigators are trying to determine what exactly went wrong. The fatal accident was the second time in two months that Walker crashed a school bus.In September, Walker was driving around a blind curve in a residential area when he failed to yield the right of way and sideswiped another car, according to the accident report.In the earlier crash, which police Sgt. Austin Garrett described as a \"minor wreck,\" Walker \"crossed over into the oncoming traffic lane to maneuver the bus through the curve and struck vehicle #2 in doing so,\" the report states. \"There were no children in the front rows, and no reports of any injuries. The damage (was) minor to both vehicles.\"Now, investigators are trying to determine why Walker, who received his commercial driver's license in April, was driving \"well above\" the speed limit Monday when the bus hit a mailbox, a utility pole and flipped on its side as it struck a tree.Garrett said no traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood. He said investigators had obtained warrants for all data devices on the bus and were reviewing video of front, back and side views of the vehicle.Another unanswered question: Why was the bus not on its designated route at the time of the crash?The bus was heading down a narrow, winding road well above the speed limit of 30 mph, according to an arrest affidavit for Walker.\"Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree,\" the affidavit states.Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher told HLN the \"driving was reckless and unsafe for conditions at the time.\"Walker now faces five counts of vehicular homicide, as well charges of reckless endangerment and reckless driving. A sixth vehicular homicide charge likely will be added, police spokeswoman Elisa Myzal said.Investigating the bus companyDurham School Services CEO David Duke said the company, which runs the bus service, was cooperating with the federal and local investigations.\"My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" he said in a YouTube statement. The bus company in 2007 was given a \"conditional safety rating\" from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It was later upgraded to \"satisfactory\" after the unspecified problems were resolved, Hart said. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015.\"We will be exploring what were the deficiencies,\" Hart said.The first lawsuit stemming from the crash was filed by the family of injured student Jamar Boling, 8. The complaint, which says Boling suffered significant physical and psychological injuries, names the driver and Durham School Services.Grandmother of victim: 'I ain't accept it yet'Of the six children who died, three were fourth-graders, one was a first-grader and one was a kindergartner. Zakiyyah Mateen still can't process the death of her 6-year-old granddaughter, Zyaira Mateen.\"That was my baby,\" she said Wednesday. \"I ain't accept it yet.\"Another victim, 9-year-old Zoie Nash, was \"a little angle here on earth\" who was about to celebrate her 10th birthday, her uncle Antwon McClain said. McClain remembered the fourth-grader as \"a sweet, sweet girl. A little angel here on earth.\"\"The family is still going to have a birthday party for her in her honor,\" he said.Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said the tragedy should remind everyone to not take their families and children for granted. \"We certainly understand on this week of Thanksgiving (that) we all need to be with our families, appreciating them, thinking about our kids,\" he said, \"because there are a lot of families hurting in our city right now.\" CNN's Devon Sayers, Justin Lear, Alisyn Camerota, Catherine E.

Here's what we know about Monday's crash:What happened? What we know: Around 3:30 p.m. Monday, a school bus carrying 37 children slammed into a tree, flipped over and split apart. Families are mourning the five killed, and several children remain hospitalized in intensive care. The driver has been charged with vehicular homicide and reckless driving. Authorities say the bus was exceeding the 30-mph speed limit. What we don't know: How fast was the bus going? Why did the bus crash? What, if anything, affected the driver? What could have prevented the crash? Investigators say they have a great deal of evidence to compile and process, including videos and interviews with the children and other witnesses. Investigators are reviewing videos from the two cameras on the bus -- one rear-facing and one forward-facing -- and an informational box on the bus to determine what caused the crash.The victimsWhat we know: Of the five Woodmore Elementary School students confirmed dead, three were fourth-graders, one was a first-grader and one was a kindergartner. One of them was D'Myunn Brown, 6. His mother told HLN that he was an outgoing boy who loved to dance to the latest YouTube videos. \"He was my only child,\" Diamond Brown said. Another victim was Zyaira Mateen, also 6. \"Everybody loved her. She's a good little girl, so sweet and smart,\" her grandmother Zakiyyah Mateen said. Before the crash, students celebrated Thanksgiving during lunchtime Monday, with one of the teachers taking a picture of one of the children who later did not survive. That photo was used to help identify the victim. A third victim was 9-year-old Zoie Nash, her uncle, Antwon McClain, told CNN.McClain remembered the fourth-grader as \"a sweet, sweet girl. A little angel here on earth.\"Cor'Dayja Jones, 9 also died in the crash, according to a funeral home.\"That smile.

Six remained hospitalized on Wednesday.What we don't know: The identity of one of the victims.The driverWhat we know: Johnthony Walker, 24, has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. He could face more charges as the investigation unfolds.\"Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree,\" according to the arrest affidavit. No traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood, lead police investigator Sgt. Austin Garrett. After the accident, Walker called his mother, Gwenevere Cook. She said her son tried to get the children off the bus. Cook described Walker as a responsible man who took care of his 3-year-old son. A co-worker at his other job at Amazon told CNN affiliate WSMV-TV that Walker worked two jobs to take care of his son. \"The picture that you paint of someone who'd do something like this is not the vibe I got from him,\" Breena Ross told the station. \"He was respectable. Just a very nice person.\" She added that he'd often come to work tired. What we don't know: Were there factors, such as fatigue or distractions, that may have affected his driving? His driving recordWhat we know: Walker received his commercial driving license in April, according to the NTSB.In September, Walker was driving a school bus when he hit another vehicle, causing minor damage. The accident report cited Walker for \"failure to yield right of way.\" The driver in the other vehicle, in an interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press, alleged that the school bus went through a stop sign and scraped her car. Also in 2013, Walker was cited for failure to show proof of insurance. His driver's license was suspended for three weeks. It was reinstated in late March 2014, according to state records.

Have there been prior complaints or issues reported about his driving to the company? The bus What we know: The bus did not have seat belts. But NTSB chairman Christopher Hart said it takes more than seat belts to prevent injuries. What we don't know: Could seat belts on the school bus have prevented the deaths and injuries? The NTSB will be looking into what else could have been done to lessen the extent of the damage and injuries.

{"_id":"Chattanooga crash: How common are outsourced school bus services?","articleText":" (CNN)A crash that killed six children in southern Tennessee this week involved a bus operated by Durham School Services -- an example of a kind of outsourcing that has been increasingly popular with US schools.School boards hire outside companies to handle their transportation needs for numerous reasons, including wanting to cut administrative challenges that come with running their own busing system, says the National School Transportation Association, an advocacy group for bus contractors.These companies hire their own drivers and operate and maintain the buses they drive.Here is a look at the outsourcing of school bus services in the United States, and at Illinois-based Durham School Services.How common is it to outsource bus services?School Bus Fleet, a trade publication for school transportation officials, last year published bus statistics from all 50 states from the 2012-2013 school year. Out of about 472,000 school buses nationwide, 34.7% were owned by contractors, and the rest were owned by school boards or states, the magazine reported.That's up from 2007-08, when 25.6% of the nation's school buses were owned by contractors, according to the magazine.How many students does Durham serve?Durham says it gives rides to more than 1 million students every day in 32 states, using more than 16,300 buses.Durham is a subsidiary of National Express LLC, which says it is the second-largest provider of outsourced school bus services in North America. Durham runs the vast majority of National Express' school bus operations.How does Durham fit into the overall picture?About 26 million students ride school buses -- outsourced or not -- in the United States, says the American School Bus Council, a coalition that includes public and private transportation providers. The largest outsourcing company, First Student Inc., says it transports about 6 million students per day, using 47,000 buses in 39 states and seven Canadian provinces.What training do contract drivers receive?States have varying rules on screening, training and evaluating school bus drivers.Durham says it meets the rules in every state in which it operates. It says that its drivers, before being hired, must pass a criminal background check, an inspection of his or her driving record and a drug screening.Hired drivers get specialized classroom and behind-the-wheel training, and are subject to an annual driving evaluation, the company says.What is Durham's safety record?Durham has a satisfactory safety rating from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.The bus company in 2007 was given a \"conditional safety rating\" from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It was later upgraded to \"satisfactory\" after the unspecified problems were resolved, said Christopher Hart, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. A website lists the most recent satisfactory rating date as July 31, 2015.In the last two years, the company's buses have been involved in 346 crashes before Monday, resulting in four deaths and injuries to about 275 people, the FMCSA says. The FMCSA's information makes no comment on the degree to which the buses were involved in the crashes, who was at fault, or whether the dead or injured were on the buses.The fatal crashes happened in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 7 (one dead); St. Louis, Missouri, on October 5, 2015 (one dead); and Waterbury, Connecticut, on February 17, 2015 (two dead).None of those who died were passengers or drivers of the buses, CNN affiliates reported at the time.Compare that with the record of the larger contractor, First Student Inc., which the FMCSA also gives a satisfactory safety rating.First Student buses were involved in 886 crashes in the last two years, resulting in six deaths and injuries to about 660 people, according to the FMCSA.As for Durham drivers, 53 \"unsafe driving\" violations were reported in the last two years, most of which (30) involved failing to use a seat belt, the administration said. Other of the more frequent violations were failing to obey a traffic control device (eight), using a mobile phone while operating (seven) and following too close (three).First Student had 44 unsafe driving violations in the same period, including 17 for not wearing seat belts, nine for speeding, and four for failing to obey a traffic control device, the FMCSA says.What has Durham said about Monday's wreck?In a YouTube statement, Durham School Services CEO David Duke said that, as a father and grandfather, he has struggled to \"get his mind around what happened\" and that he was filled with pain.  \"I can't fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and it involved one of my company's buses,\" he said. \"Nothing that I can say can take away the pain and the grief for these families. What I can say is that I'm deeply sorry for the children that were taken from their families with so much life before them.\"He said the company was cooperating with National Transportation Safety Board and local investigators.  \"My responsibility now is to look for answers -- answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" he said. \"I don't want to compromise that investigation. I want to know what happened. I'm not able to elaborate on either the accident or the investigation ... . What I can do is promise that I'm determined, that we're determined, to find out what happened. And that we will offer any support that we can to the families.\"  CNN's Devon Sayers and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/us/chattanooga-school-bus-crash-outsourcing-qa/index.html"}
{"_id":"Chattanooga crash: Investigators search for answers","articleText":" (CNN)A school bus packed with children slammed into a tree, flipped over and split apart.Shell-shocked students and parents cried as rescuers worked for hours to pull them from the wreckage.This was the horrifying scene Monday afternoon on a street in Chattanooga, Tennessee. By Tuesday evening, the initial shock had given way to mourning and healing.At least five children were killed in the crash, school officials said, and six others are hospitalized in an intensive care unit. \"Five is a cursed number in our city right now,\" Mayor Andy Berke said. \"The most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child.\"Meanwhile, the investigation continues into the cause of the crash and the driver, 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, who has been arrested on vehicular homicide charges. Community comes togetherCrowds gathered throughout Tuesday at a makeshift memorial in front of the home where the crash occurred on Monday around 3:20 p.m. The bus left Woodmore Elementary School with 37 students and did not make any stops before the crash, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart said in a news conference Tuesday. Families desperate for information began to swarm Erlanger Children's Hospital Monday night, where children were treated for minor injuries, such as bruises and cuts, as well as broken limbs and traumatic head and spinal injuries, Erlanger Health System Senior Vice President Jan Keys said. Staff treated and released 19 patients Monday, most within two hours of their arrival. As of Tuesday afternoon, 12 patients remained, six in critical care and six stable. One child was sent to the adult emergency room and was released from there.Donations of blood, toys and money poured in; well-wishers in Ohio delivered hundreds of boxes of pizza to the hospital. At one point on Tuesday more than 800 people filled waiting rooms and common areas, waiting for their child's name to be called. The task of identifying children was complicated by their school uniforms, age and traumatized condition. Many children were unable to spell their names; some did not know their last names or their parents' names and could only answer \"mama\" when asked. Parents used who had pictures of their children on their cellphones gave them to staff to identify them, Keys said. They were assisted by school staff, pastors and police.One teacher helped staff identify a student who did not survive with a picture she had taken at school Monday during a Thanksgiving lunch celebration. The picture of the smiling child brought a moment of happiness to the grieving family, Keys said. \"I think it was helpful for the family to know what one of [the child's] the last moments might have been like,\" Keys said.At sunset the community filled the New Monumental Baptist Church across from Woodmore Elementary School for a vigil. Hundreds of mourners filled the pews and extra rows of folding chairs and took up every inch of standing space. They cried and raised their hands in prayer as they sang of how God is in control, and that no matter how bleak the situation, things will get better. A survivor of the crash hobbled to the front of the crowd in crutches, bringing the tearful crowd to its feet. \"We love the children of Woodmore with all our hearts. We will grieve together and honor our children's lives,\" Hamilton County Interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly said.'My baby was gone'While some families left the hospital Tuesday reunited with their children, not everyone was so lucky. Diamond Brown waited about seven hours to learn her 6-year-old son's fate on Monday. She went to the scene, and knew D'Myunn would be sitting at the front of the bus. That's where he always sat. She saw him there, day after day, when she picked him up from the bus stop.It wasn't until hours later, Brown said, that authorities at the hospital told her that her son had died.\"There was nothing that they could do for him,\" she said, sobbing. \"It just took so long for me to find out that my baby was gone. He was my only child.\"Of the five children confirmed dead after Monday's crash, three were fourth-graders, one was a first-grader and one was a kindergartner.Police chief: Investigators focusing on speedA National Transportation Safety Board team arrived in Chattanooga on Tuesday morning to investigate the crash.The school bus was heading down a narrow and winding road Monday afternoon well above the speed limit of 30 mph, according to an arrest affidavit. \"Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree,\" the affidavit says.The NTSB plans to speak with a witness who was driving behind the bus, said Hart, the NTSB chairman. Investigators also plan to review video from two cameras on the bus, one rear-facing and one forward-facing.The bus did not have seat belts but it takes more than seat belts to prevent injuries, Hart said. The NTSB will be looking into what else could have been done to contain the scope of damage and injuries. \"We still need to be concerned with the totality of the safety inside the the bus,\" he said.Bus driver's mother: 'He was terrified'The NTSB also plans to speak with the driver, who has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Walker received his commercial driver's license in April, Hart said. Since then, records show he received a traffic citation for side-swiping a car in September while driving a school bus.After the crash, Walker's mother said she got a phone call from her son, who told her he'd been in a \"drastic accident\" and tried to explain what had happened before police took his phone away.\"When he talked to me, he was terrified,\" Gwenevere Cook said.\"He was trying to get them (children) off the bus -- all the bodies were limp. There was blood everywhere. He has been cooperating with the police. He texted me minutes later saying the kids are dead,\" she said. Cook expressed condolences to the victims' families and asked for compassion for her son, describing him as a respected man and a father of a 3-year-old son who worked two jobs and had never been in trouble before. \"It is a horrible nightmare,\" Cook said. \"I feel bad for my son, and I am torn up for the (victims') family members.\"'Unanswered questions'The company that operated the bus and employed Walker has come under scrutiny. Durham School Services, a company that transports more than 1 million students daily at schools across the United States, said it was working with police and school officials to investigate.Neither the city of Chattanooga nor its schools interacts with the company, Chattanooga Mayor  Berke said. Hamilton County runs the bus system.The company's website -- which normally depicts smiling children and bright yellow school buses beside a pledge about getting students to school safely -- was black on Tuesday, greeting visitors with a somber statement about the Chattanooga crash.\"Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students,\" the statement said.

A star on the softball field. Hours after they celebrated Thanksgiving at an elementary school lunch on Monday, their school bus swerved off the road, flipped over and slammed into a tree. Five children died at the scene. One died days later from his injuries.The deadly crash in Chattanooga, Tennessee, left a devastated community mourning the victims and searching for answers. The bus driver is behind bars, charged with vehicular homicide. But authorities are still working to pinpoint exactly what caused the crash.Here's what we've learned so far about five of the victims (CNN has not yet confirmed the identity of one of the victims):Zoie Nash: Softball starZoie Nash played basketball, but softball was her love.Her uncle, Antwon McClain, described her as a \"sweet, sweet girl -- a little angel here on Earth.\"Zoie was just a few weeks away from her 10th birthday, he said.

{"_id":"Chicago officer kills man; police check claim he was armed ","articleText":" (CNN)A Chicago police officer says he shot and killed a black man this week after the man twice pointed a weapon at him, but so far investigators have not found the weapon, authorities say.Police are investigating the death of the man -- identified by his family as Kajuan Raye, 19 -- which comes after months of heavy scrutiny of the department over cases of alleged overreach in officer-involved shootings.\"We were not able to locate a weapon (of Raye's) as of yet,\" police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"There's still many unanswered questions and we are working diligently to find those answers.\"The shootingPolice say a sergeant was called to an intersection near Ogden Park on the city's south side late Wednesday about a report of a \"battery in progress.\"When the sergeant approached a man who he says matched the description of a suspect, the man -- who turned out to be Raye -- ran, and the sergeant chased him, police say.\"The sergeant then told investigators that the offender turned and pointed a weapon in the direction of the sergeant on two separate occasions during the pursuit,\" Johnson said.The sergeant shot the man, killing him, Johnson said.Investigators searched the area overnight, but they have not found the weapon that the man is alleged to have had, the superintendent said. Police have not released the sergeant's name. He will be taken off patrol and placed on administrative duties for at least 30 days, as is routine for officers involved in a shooting while it is reviewed.Video taken by two surveillance cameras outside a church shows Raye running and the officer chasing him out of the cameras' view, CNN affiliate WLS reported. The footage does not show the shooting. Family's lawyers call for prosecution Raye's relatives said he did not own a gun, WLS reported.  Raye, of Dolton, just south of Chicago, was a \"fun-loving and happy kid who had a bright future,\" his relatives said in a statement released by the Montgomery Law Firm, which says it is representing the family in the case.Raye's family is \"heartbroken that their son is dead at the hands of a police officer who does not value the sanctity of life of black males,\" the statement reads. \"As a city we continue to struggle with police who are afraid of and have deep seeded prejudices against black youth. The family has asked its lawyers to \"investigate, get answers and hold accountable this officer and Chicago Police Department,\" the statement reads.A lawyer with the firm, Jay Payne, told CNN the claim that Raye pointed a weapon is absurd, given that police haven't found one after what Johnson said was a grid search of the area.Payne said Raye was waiting with a cousin for a bus when the officer approached him.\"We will be asking the Cook County state's attorney to prosecute this officer,\" Payne said. Chicago police under fire over shootingsRaye's death comes more than two years after the shooting by Chicago police of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, a case that spurred reforms and protests and helped fuel a national conversation about police officers' use of deadly force.McDonald's death in October 2014 went largely unacknowledged until a judge ordered the department to release dashboard-camera footage that contradicted officers' accounts of the shooting. Just before the video was released in November 2015, Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in the McDonald case; he pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He was the first Chicago officer charged with first-degree murder since 1980.  The superintendent of police at the time of the McDonald shooting, Garry McCarthy, was fired by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel this year, and the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency charged with investigating police-involved shootings, is being overhauled.Years of mistrustEmanuel created a Police Accountability Task Force in response to public outcry for accountability and transparency after the release of the McDonald shooting video.In April, a report from the task force said police \"have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color\" and have alienated blacks and Hispanics with the use of force and a longstanding code of silence.During the past eight years, 74% of people killed or injured by Chicago police officers were African-American, the report said.The task force, which included five Chicagoans who have been leaders in the justice system, found that 72% of people stopped by Chicago police in 2014 were African-American, and 17% were Hispanic.To address the slew of systemic issues within the police department, the task force recommended nearly 100 changes. Emanuel has announced the implementation of nearly one-third of those recommendations, including replacing the Independent Police Review Authority with an agency that has \"more independence.\"CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Steve Almasy, Ray Sanchez, Marilia Brocchetto, Emanuella Grinberg and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/us/chicago-police-shooting/index.html"}
{"_id":"Children's bedrooms around the world","articleText":" (CNN)A child's bedroom often expresses their identity. From brightly colored walls filled with posters to toys and books scattered around, it is truly their place of comfort. But for some children around the world, their bedroom is no more than a mat outside or a collection of old sheets, tires and trash on a dirt floor.The inequalities children face are depicted in James Mollison's photo series \"Where Children Sleep,\" which is currently on display at the David J. Sencer CDC Museum in Atlanta.Although it has been nearly six years since Mollison's collection was first published, it still sparks conversation among people of all ages.\"I did not anticipate that 'Where Children Sleep' would be so successful,\" said Mollison, who is based in Venice, Italy. \"I am particularly pleased that it has engaged people in imagining the lives of others in very different circumstances.\"\"Where Children Sleep\" illustrates children's bedrooms alongside a portrait of them against a white background. Mollison chose a neutral background because he wanted to provide a sense of equality for all the kids. The 56 diverse photos depict a world of poverty and privilege. \"From the start, I didn't want it just to be about 'needy children' in the developing world, but rather something more inclusive, about children from all types of situations,\" Mollison wrote on his website.Nine-year-old Jamie lives in a top-floor apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York. Prena, a 14-year-old domestic worker, lives in a cell-like room atop the building where she works in Nepal. Lehlohonolo is a 6-year-old boy who sleeps with his three brothers on the floor of a mud hut in Lesotho. Mollison was introduced to his subjects through friends of friends and organizations like Save the Children. The response from families and children when Mollison entered their homes was varied, and access was sometimes difficult.\"One issue I had with situations where we had set things up beforehand was, the rooms would often be immaculately tidy, certainly not how I kept mine,\" Mollison said. \"Getting parents to keep them as they are was often impossible.\"His photographs were shot in the United States, Japan, the West Bank, Colombia, Cambodia and many other locations. He intended to produce his book for adults, but as his work came together, Mollison thought it was a good idea to write with children in mind. He says he \"didn't sanitize the stories, but they were edited by a schoolteacher for appropriate language.\"Mollison has continued to work on a variety of projects but simultaneously has photographed children and their bedrooms when he comes across them. \"Where Children Sleep\" has been so well-received  that Mollison is aiming to publish another take on the theme. His new book will focus on one of the most important issues of our time, one that is particularly relevant to children: the refugee crisis.  There are nearly 21.3 million refugees around the world, more than half of whom are under the age of 18, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He plans to call this project \"Where Refugee Children Sleep.\"James Mollison is a photographer based in Venice, Italy. You can follow him on Instagram and Twitter.

{"_id":"Chilled by Trump tweets? You should be","articleText":"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM's radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)This weekend we saw President-elect Donald Trump lash out twice at Americans who were exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. His reaction should chill every American with its implication: A President Trump may well try to suppress speech.On Friday night, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the smash hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton,\" where some in the crowd reportedly booed him.  On Sunday, Pence acknowledged this: \"When we arrived we heard a few boos, and we heard some cheers,\" he said, \"I nudged my kids and reminded them that is what freedom sounds like.\" He's right.That wasn't good enough for Trump. News reports of the incident — and the optics that came along with them -- were apparently too much for him, and he took to Twitter to make it clear that Americans should never engage in that type of expression: \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\" Trump's line \"This should not happen!\" could not be more wrong.  Americans have every right to boo our elected officials, who, after all, are employed by the country's citizens. It's a form of expression that is, and must continue to be, protected.But there was more. On Sunday morning Trump stunningly lashed out at \"Saturday Night Live\" because the comedy show featured comedy at his expense, as it long has.  Trump tweeted: \"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" Think about what Trump is saying with this tweet.  The man who will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in January is not just upset that a comedy show is making fun of him but is demanding it make changes to its content to please him. Trump -- a man who hosted \"SNL\" twice -- is undoubtedly aware that mocking our presidents is a tradition that separates our nation from dictatorships, where such speech is not freely allowed. And this is not the first time Trump went after \"SNL,\" a show that for decades has drawn viewers precisely because of its up-to-the-minute satire. Just 24 days before Election Day, Trump was so outraged at \"SNL's\" comically ridiculing him that he called for the show to be canceled, tweeting that \"SNL\" did a \"hit job on me,\" adding, \"Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.\" At the time, concerns over Trump's comments were tempered by the fact that polls showed it was unlikely he would win. But that has changed and so must our response.If a President Trump continues on this path unchallenged, the result could be new limitations on free speech.   For one thing, comedy shows and even other critics of the prospective President may begin to self-censor. Why? Well, as we have seen, a certain sect of Trump's fans has viciously attacked critics on his behalf. For example, some Jewish journalists who have criticized Trump have been subjected to vile, anti-Semitic hate from self-professed Trump fans.  These reporters and writers have not only been sent disgusting Holocaust imagery on social media, but some Trump fans also found the home addresses of these journalists and made death threats. Where is Trump's denunciation of this behavior?  On the contrary, with his own words, he seeks to stifle dissent -- even before he has assumed his new job -- emboldening his followers in their intimidation.  It is easy to see how fear could cause some to muzzle their valid criticism of Trump. There is also anther concern.  Trump's comments on the campaign trial have to make you wonder if he truly values freedom of the press or expression.  During his campaign, Trump defended violent attacks upon those protesters who dared to interrupt him.  And Trump has even vowed to change the libel laws to crack down on the media criticizing him. As Trump told us in February, he wanted the libel laws revised so that if journalists write \"purposely negative\" articles, \"we can sue them and win lots of money.\" Apart from enacting laws, no one can assure us that a President Trump, given his self-professed vindictive nature, would not pressure the Federal Communications Commission or TV executives to cancel comedy shows that mock him \"unfairly.\"  In fact a President has done this kind of thing before: President Richard Nixon reportedly lobbied CBS executives to cancel \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in 1969 because they criticized him comedically. Mike Pence is correct that dissent is the sound of freedom. And if you value freedom of expression, you cannot simply dismiss Trump's tweets this weekend, especially given his track record.  Our nation, of course, will not lose freedom of expression over a few tweets. But it's the job of the President to uphold the Constitution and the values that we hold dear, not threaten to undermine them over petty slights that are, in any case, protected speech.

{"_id":"China lodges complaint over Trump-Taiwan call","articleText":" (CNN)China's foreign ministry said Saturday it has lodged a complaint with the United States over a controversial phone call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan's President that has overturned decades of diplomatic protocol.China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China, with US-China relations governed by a set of protocols known as the \"one China\" policy. This means there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan -- so Trump's decision to take Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's call could risk a major upset.\"We have noticed relevant reports and lodged solemn representation with the relevant side in the United States,\" said a statement Saturday from China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.\"I must point out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory ...

Those who refuse could be barred from leaving the country.Xinjiang is an ethnically divided and resource rich province that is home to around 10 million predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and around eight million Han Chinese.No reason was given for the policy, however the World Uyghur Congress, a Germany-based rights group, said it was deliberate move to restrict the movements of the Uyghur population.\"Although the regulations ostensibly target all residents, Chinese authorities in the past have taken clear steps to limit mobility rights for the Uyghur community in particular,\" the Congress said in a statement.Terror attacks in China China has blamed Uyghur separatists for a number of attacks in recent years, including one on a coalmine in September 2015, in which 50 people were killed.But exiled groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive religious policies and economic marginalization are provoking the unrest.\"Chinese authorities have given no credible reason for taking away people's passports, violating their right to freedom of movement,\" Sophie Richardson, China Director for Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"Doing so across an entire region is a form of collective punishment and fuels resentment toward the government in a region where tensions are high.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/asia/china-xinjiang-passports/index.html"}

{"_id":"China's most explosive artist has built a 1,650-ft tall ladder made of fire","articleText":" (CNN)Cai Guo-Qiang is back, and with his most ambitious project to date: a 1,650-foot ladder in the sky made of -- what else? -- fire. The Chinese artist, who featured in CNN Style's inaugural TV show, is the subject of an upcoming documentary directed by Kevin Macdonald (\"The Last King of Scotland\") and produced by Wendi Murdoch. It was released on Netflix on October 14.\"Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang\", which received its European premier at the London Film Festival, showcases Cai's exquisite gunpowder art, which he says explores Eastern philosophy and contemporary social issues.And with unprecedented access to Cai's studio, Macdonald arrives just in time to see the artist fulfill a career-long ambition.Cai, winner of the Golden Lion at the 48th Venice Biennale in 1999, told CNN earlier this year that \"the most powerful artwork is when there's fear.\" There's plenty of that going around in the lead up to setting fire to his ladder, a delicate structure entwined with gunpowder, suspended by a giant balloon in the waters off Quanzhou, China. Just before 5 a.m. on a summer's morning, with family and friends watching, Cai sets off his creation. It's a surprisingly serene moment and yet a mighty crescendo to a project 21 years in the making, after failed attempts in 1994, 2001 and 2012.Watching from home is his elderly grandmother. It's a poignant milestone; a woman who once saved their living room from ruin when a young Cai accidentally set a canvas on fire in one of his early gunpowder experiments. Even more touching is that after failed attempts in Bath, Shanghai and Los Angeles, Cai succeeds in his hometown.\"Listen to that sound, full of power and grandeur,\" says the artist. \"It's amazing, amazing, amazing.\"His sincere pleasure in his craft is infectious, as well as the relief when all goes to plan. Cai's mother, looking on, wryly concedes that \"these people [his crew] have been through some difficult days.\"\"You can go back to sleep now,\" Cai tells his grandmother afterward. He'd finally done it.\"Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang\" is available on Netflix on October 14.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/arts/cai-guo-qiang-sky-ladder/index.html"}
{"_id":"Chinese scientists use gene-editing techniques in humans for first time","articleText":"Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese scientists have become the first in the world to use the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique in humans. On October 28, genetically modified cells were injected into a patient at the West China Hospital in Chengdu with aggressive lung cancer, according to the scientific journal Nature. The team of scientists, led by Lu You of Sichuan University, extracted immune cells from the patients and edited them using CRISPR-Cas9.The technique knocks out a gene that normally acts as a check on the cell's ability to launch an immune response and prevents it from attacking healthy cells. The modified cells were then multiplied and re-introduced into the patients' bloodstream where, it is hoped, they will home in on the cancer and wipe it out.Liao Zhilin, who handles communications for the team, told CNN \"everything is going as planned,\" but would not go into details. He said information on the results and findings of the study would be released when they are ready.Gene-editingCRISPR stands for clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats -- regular patterns of DNA sequences which can be edited out of genes.Cas9 is a type of modified protein injected into a body to work on the DNA, like a pair of scissors that can snip the genes.The technique is based on a decade-old discovery that certain bacterial cells can identify invading viruses and chop up their DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 adapts that technique to allow us to edit genes, removing harmful diseases and even allowing the creation of hybrid human-animal organs to fill the transplant gap.New space race Lu's team is not the only one working on using the gene-editing technique in humans. A planned US trial is due to start in early 2017, using CRISPR-edited genes to treat various cancers. \"I think this is going to trigger 'Sputnik 2.0', a biomedical duel on progress between China and the United States, which is important since competition usually improves the end product,\" Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, and scientific adviser to the US trial, told Nature. In March 2017, a team at Beijing University hopes to launch three clinical trials using gene-editing against bladder, prostate and renal-cell cancers. \"One of the most important elements of CRISPR development in China is scale,\" Christina Larson, a contributing correspondent for Science magazine, told CNN in April. \"It's being deployed in many different ways, in many different labs.\"SafetyLu's team plans to treat 10 patients, and the main purpose of the trial is to test its safety. Patients will be monitored for six months to determine whether there are any negative side effects from the treatment. While Lu's trial has been welcomed by other medical practitioners, according to Nature, previous Chinese advances in gene-editing have not been so warmly received. Multiple trials on human embryos by Chinese scientists, while providing potentially live-saving insights into the treatment of HIV and other diseases, have raised ethical questions, particularly with regard to the future potential for so-called \"designer babies.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/health/china-human-gene-testing-crispr-cas9/index.html"}
{"_id":"Chipotle's menu, as curated by a nutritionist ","articleText":" (CNN)Considering that so many Americans consume a large percentage of meals outside the home, how do you reach nutrition goals with so many options? We've done the legwork for you at the most popular fast food chains.Chipotle will give you your fill of Mexican food, but because you have free rein to create your own meals from various fillings and toppings, the calories and sodium counts can add up quickly. Note that the nutritional information we provide is based on Chipotle's online calculator. But one nutrient you won't have to worry about at Chipotle is sugar, as most of the menu's options are low in sugar. Just steer clear of the sugar-sweetened beverages on the menu.Here are the best Chipotle options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by good choices for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kidsOur picks: Kids tacos (build your own): Soft corn tortillas with chicken, black beans and tomato salsa; Mandarin oranges and organic milkThis meal provides more protein (30 grams) and less saturated fat (3 grams) than the kids' cheese quesadilla, and it gives kids more than a third of their daily calcium needs, thanks to the milk. The Mandarin orange has only 35 calories and offers a vitamin C boost.  For vegetariansOur pick: Tacos (soft corn tortillas) with black beans, fajita vegetables, cheese and romaine lettuceVegetarians may be tempted to add the \"sofritas\" (a mix of tofu, chilis and poblanos), even though it's included. The black beans alone will take you further nutritionally; they have more fiber (12 grams vs. 3.5 grams), much less sodium (260 milligrams vs. 555 milligrams) and about the same amount of protein (7 grams vs. 8 grams). And the sodium in the sofritas represents almost a quarter of your daily limit.The beans also give you a bigger bang for your bite when compared with the brown rice option, as you get more protein and fiber. And if you really want to give yourself a nutritional upgrade, skip the cheese and grab a container of organic milk to save sodium and saturated fat.For vegansOur pick: Tacos (soft corn tortillas) with black beans, fajita vegetables and romaine lettuceThe best vegan option is the same as the vegetarian one, minus the cheese, which cuts out 100 calories and 5 grams of saturated fat.For calorie countersOur pick: Salad with romaine lettuce, chicken, fajita vegetables and tomatillo green-chili salsaNot only is the tomatillo-green chili salsa lowest in calories out of all the salsas, research shows that the heat it gives off can cut your appetite, too. And skip the salad dressing; half the packet adds another 135 calories, 12.5 grams of fat and 425 milligrams of sodium. Without it, the salad has only 225 calories.For the sugar-sensitiveOur picks: Everything on the menu is low in sugar, except the vinaigrette dressing and most of the drinks.For the salt-sensitiveOur pick: Tacos with soft corn tortillas, chicken and romaine lettuceIt's not easy to go low-sodium at Chipotle, but avoiding salty fillings, toppings and salad dressing is your best bet.These tacos may be plain, but they are one of the lowest-sodium options available (at 385 milligrams, total). If you need a topping, choose the sour cream because (at 30 milligrams, according to Chipotle's website) it won't make a huge sodium dent. It will boost saturated fat, though.Other lower-sodium options include a burrito bowl with chicken and brown rice (505 milligrams) or chicken and fajita vegetables (480 milligrams).For the gluten-sensitiveOur picks: According to Chipotle's website, everything on the menu is wheat- and gluten-free, except soft flour tortillas (used for burritos and tacos). And if corn is an issue for you, choose a salad or burrito bowl.For the athleteOur picks: Burrito (flour tortilla) with steak, brown rice and romaine lettuceThe carbs in this burrito will fuel muscles for exercise. Plus, the steak contributes protein along with iron, which helps deliver oxygen to muscles. It's true that the sodium is on the higher side, but if you're sweating a lot, you can afford some extra milligrams. Just avoid those salsas to keep sodium in check.For the road warriorOur picks: Kids tacos (build your own): soft corn tortillas with chicken, brown rice and fajita vegetables; Mandarin orange and organic milk Yes, it's from the kids' menu, but downsizing your meal while driving will keep you from feeling stuffed and sluggish. This meal is protein-rich and moderate in fat, a winning combo when you need sustained energy. Skip the beans, as they may cause GI discomfort while on the road. And save that Mandarin for a snack when you need it.For the carb-consciousOur pick: Burrito bowl with chicken, fajita vegetables, tomatillo green-chili salsa, guacamole and romaine lettuceYou might not think of this meal as a true \"burrito,\" but by sacrificing the tortilla, you get to enjoy a heaping of guacamole. Yes, the fat numbers are high, but the guacamole is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. If you can do half of the guacamole portion, you skim almost 200 milligrams of sodium.

Aleppo is Syria's second-largest city and was once its commercial hub.\"If the regime retakes the whole of Aleppo, it would be a very symbolic victory,\" Fabrice Balanche, a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute, told CNN.\"It would mean it can take the north of the country and would leave no possibility for a real political or military opposition to the Assad regime.\"Balanche pointed out that with the election of US President-elect Donald Trump, international support for rebel groups opposing the regime would likely wane.But while recapturing Aleppo would mark a turning point, it won't bring the war to an end any time soon.There are between 100,000 and 150,000 rebels in Syria, Balanche said, and they are unlikely to lay down arms in large numbers.\"There will be a reduction of violence, but we will not see any peace in the next few months,\" Balanche said. 500 killed in 2 weeksForces on Saturday broke through rebel defense lines on the ground and by Monday had taken much of the area's north.Russian state media TASS reported that regime forces were now in control of 40% of eastern Aleppo, citing a Russian Defense Ministry \"reconciliation center\" in Syria.Russia has been the Syrian government's closest and most powerful ally in the country's civil war, carrying out regular airstrikes to prop up Assad's regime.More than 500 people have been killed in the past two weeks since the push began, according to the White Helmets. Another 1,800 have been injured, the group said. There's been minimal resistance from rebels, several civilians on the ground said.Among neighborhoods now in regime hands is eastern Aleppo's biggest district, Masaken Hanano, while on Monday forces retook another key district, al-Sakhour, according to Syrian state media.'Worried about reprisals'Eastern Aleppo has become the epicenter of Syria's civil war -- the government has besieged it a number of times. Its most recent siege has cut off both the rebels and civilians from the outside world, leaving communities on the brink of starvation -- without sufficient food, clean water, fuel and medical supplies. Around 10,000 people have fled the area in the past few days, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Monday, adding that 6,000 of them fled to areas controlled by Kurdish forces.And more than 3,000 fled to government-controlled parts of the city in the last 24 hours, according to Russian and Syrian state media, quoting the Russian reconciliation center in Syria located on the Hmeymim military base.An estimated 250,000 people have been trapped in eastern Aleppo since July, when regime forces besieged the area. Among them are 100,000 children, says UNICEF, the UN's child rights organization.Others are too afraid to use the government's \"human corridors,\" fearing reprisal once they escape. But staying to see the regime regain neighborhoods is not an option for many either. \"Shelling, lack of food, lack of treatment and freezing is nothing in comparison with being in hands of Assad and his allies,\" tweeted a resident activist there.Safe passage?Human rights group Amnesty International has called for safe passage for civilians. \"We are calling on all parties to the conflict to allow free and unrestricted movement of civilians ... without threat or constraint,\" said Diana Semaan, a Syria campaigner with Amnesty International. \"Activists I spoke to in eastern Aleppo are worried about reprisals for being outspoken critics of the government if rebels lose control of the entire city,\" she said. Several chemical attacks have also been reported over the past two weeks. The Aleppo Media Center activist group said that barrel bombs laced with chlorine were dropped on two neighborhoods on Monday. CNN has not been able to independently verify the recent alleged chemical attacks, but has seen footage of the aftermath of some. Children have been among victims in these attacks.A UN investigation in late August found that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, both by the national air force and ISIS militants. But barrel bombs are typically dropped by regime forces.CNN's Joe Sterling, Eliza Mackintosh, Nick Paton Walsh, Schams Elwazer and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Clashes over Dakota Access Pipeline escalate","articleText":" (CNN)Police and about 400 people who were protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline clashed Sunday evening as demonstrators set cars on fire and police launched tear gas and water at the crowds.A live stream from the North Dakota location showed a chaotic, loud scene, with people screaming and car horns honking. Protesters were attempting to cross the Backwater Bridge and go north on Highway 1806, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, which described Sunday's events as an \"ongoing riot.\"Protesters set fire to two trucks and several parts of the bridge, police said. On Sunday night, police released a statement saying that the protesters \"attempted to flank and attack the law enforcement line from the west,\" describing their actions as \"very aggressive.\"Officers tried to disperse the crowds with water cannons. Some decried the use of water on the crowd on a cold night when temperatures fell to 28 degrees Fahrenheit. Physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council called for \"the immediate cessation of use of water cannons\" over concerns of hypothermia in the cold weather conditions. They criticized the \"potentially lethal use of these confrontational methods against people peacefully assembled.\"But police say the protesters are not peaceful and that water was used to put out fires as well as to control the crowds. \"There are multiple fires being set by protesters on the bridge and in the area of the bridge,\" said Donnell Hushka, spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff's Department. \"We have fire trucks on the scene they are using their fire hoses to put out the fires, wet the land around so fires don't spread and they are also using water as crowd control.\"One person has been arrested, police said.Protests have simmered for months, spawning bitter clashes over the 1,172-mile oil pipeline that would span from North Dakota to Illinois. Why protests are happeningProtesters say the Dakota Access Pipeline will threaten the environment and destroy Native American burial sites, prayer sites and culturally significant artifacts. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says construction of the pipeline -- which is currently slated to run under the Missouri River -- could affect its drinking water supply and put communities living downstream \"at risk for contamination by crude oil leaks and spills.\"Multiple groups have joined the protests over the months. Protesters appear to be digging their heels in for the winter by building structures in a protest camp without permits, said the Morton County Sheriff's Department. \"Their actions are both illegal and likely insufficient to protect them from the elements,\" said Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. \"We've seen that many of these protestors are not from North Dakota and may not be familiar with the harshness of our winters, and we urge them to leave the camps and seek appropriate shelter for their own health and safety.\"Bernie Sanders tweeted that the president \"must protect the safety of Native Americans and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline.\"Status of the pipelineLast week, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it had delayed construction work on the controversial pipeline to hold further \"discussion and analysis\" with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline slammed the latest decision as \"lacking legal or factual justification.\" Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners took legal action, asking a federal court to allow them to complete the pipeline. Dakota Access is a $3.7-billion project that backers have touted as the safest and most efficient way to transport oil, rather than using rail or trucks.CNN's Joe Sutton and Tony Marco contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Cleaner in Saudi Arabia showered with gifts after social media mockery","articleText":" (CNN)A cleaner in the capital of Saudi Arabia was given a set of gold jewels and promised thousands of riyals after he was ridiculed on social media when a photo of him staring at a jewelry shop display went viral. An Instagram user had mocked the cleaner, who is from Bangladesh but works in Riyadh, by posting the photo with a caption that read \"he looks as though he is seeing trash\". The comment prompted an outpouring of support for the cleaner on social media, and Abdullah al Qahtani, the owner of the Twitter account Ensaniyat (humanitarianism), started a campaign to find the man in the photo. \"I received tons of phone calls and messages in response to my tweet. Some were really helpful, while others were claiming that they were the cleaner,\" al Qahtani said. \"But three hours [after] my tweet, which was shared over 6,000 times, we found him,\" the 38-year-old businessman told CNN over the phone. Twitter users were able to identify the location of the cleaner, Nazer al-Islam Abdul Karim, from the reflection of the shop glass visible in the photo. When al Qahtani posted a new photo of Abdul Karim, people began asking for a way to get in touch with him.\"Some wanted to donate gold sets, others cash, iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones,\" al Qahtani said. \"Even a rice company wanted to donate rice bags to Nazer al-Islam.\"Turki al-Dajam, an executive at a Saudi sports channel, posted videos on Snapchat showing Abdul Karim choosing a gold set. He also posted photos of the cleaner with his new gifts.Abdul Karim, who is 65, told CNN that he was delighted with the gifts. Describing the moment the photo was taken, he said: \"I saw a flash. I didn't know what this was. Then I heard that my photo was in the media.\"\"I was just doing my job as a cleaner in the municipality and found myself in front of the gold shop. I am very happy about the gifts and very thankful.\" Al Qahtani -- who set up the Ensanyat Twitter account to connect social media users with people in need across Riyadh -- said it was very endearing to see the amount of solidarity from people in Saudi Arabia, but also across the Gulf region. \"I really wish we can always stay united like this to help people in need,\" he told CNN.

{"_id":"Climate change worries escalate as Trump elevates top deniers","articleText":" (CNN)As the shape of President-elect Donald Trump's new administration comes into focus, environmental activists and organizations who had found an ally in the Obama White House are preparing for a fight to protect their gains of the past eight years.  Trump's ascendance is threatening not to simply undo a series of already tenuous international agreements, but give a boost to interests opposed to fossil fuel regulation, while amplifying voices who express doubt -- or outright deny -- that climate change is real. It is. Scientists agree people are causing climate change primarily by burning fossil fuels, and the longterm consequences are expected to be disastrous.\"\"The disaster that Donald Trump represents for the climate cannot be understated,\" Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350.org, a leading environmental action group, told CNN on Tuesday. \"He is the only head of state in the world who is an all-out climate denier and he has the most radical, anti-environmental policies of anyone to ever assume the role of the presidency.\"Here are the four centers of concern -- right now:1. Trump plans to resist the Paris climate dealThe Paris Climate Agreement became international law November 4, days before Trump scored his upset defeat of Hillary Clinton. But the non-binding deal is still very much a work in progress. Negotiators are gathered now in Marrakech, Morocco, in an effort to implement its historic framework.While the Trump administration does not have the authority to \"cancel\" the international pact, as the now President-elect pledged during the campaign, it is reportedly looking for ways out and could, because individual countries set their own standards, effectively remove the US from the process. \"If one party decides to withdraw that it doesn't call the agreement into question,\" Moroccan foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar said at a news conference last weekend in an effort to downplay the new administration's potential action -- or inaction.But a US reversal would likely also cause other major carbon emitting nations, like China or India, to at least slow their own efforts. 2. Obama's \"Clean Power Plan\" under threatThe keystone of the US plan to meet its Paris accord commitments is currently tied up in federal courts, with the Environmental Protection Agency fighting a legal challenge from nearly two dozen states, the Chamber of Commerce and coal-mining companies.During the campaign, Trump framed the \"Clean Power Plan,\" which promises a nearly 32% reduction in domestic greenhouse emissions by 2030, as a job-killer he would be quick to scuttle.\"This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plants in America,\" Trump said during a September speech. \"They're shutting down all over the country.\"The crux of the plan, though, should it survive the court challenge, relies on the authority and willingness of the EPA to carry out its mandate. Trump could easily decline that and seek to roll it back during his term.3. Trump picked a leading climate denier to head the EPA transitionTrump's decision to install Myron Ebell as the head of his EPA transition team sent shivers through the activist community.Ebell, though not a scientist, has emerged as one of the world's foremost climate deniers. As the Paris pact entered its final (and successful) stage of negotiations at an international conference in December 2015, his face was one of seven pasted, mug shot-style, outside hotels in the French capital. A few months before that, he wrote in a blog post that Obama's \"Clean Power Plan\" was \"illegal\" and lamented the gains likely to be incurred by \"renewable energy producers\" at the expense of coal and natural gas.Now the man activists call a \"climate criminal,\" and who has said that climate change is \"phony\" and a bogus \"pretext for expanding government,\" has been given the power to staff the federal agency most often tasked with monitoring and enforcing actions to slow or reverse it.4. Trump himself is a climate denier \"He believes that global warming is naturally occurring,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" the morning after the first presidential debate. The issue came up because Hillary Clinton had, the night before, said that her opponent \"thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\"Trump made the claim on Twitter in 2012, almost four years to the day he was elected, writing, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"It is a thread he has kept up for years, often through skeptical tweets. \"It's late in July and it is really cold outside in New York,\" he wrote in July 2014. \"Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING??? We need some fast! It's now CLIMATE CHANGE.\"And on a cold January evening in 2015, he asked, \"Where the hell is global warming when you need it?\"Trump has said he was \"joking\" about the Chinese conspiracy theory, but in multiple public statements has framed policies designed to combat climate change as a threat to American industry.\"I am not a believer in climate change,\" he told CNN in September 2015. \"You have rain, and you have beautiful days. But I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/climate-change-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Clinics help keep people with serious mental illness out of ER","articleText":"San AntonioYolanda Solar has battled a life-threatening disease for more than three decades.The disease nearly killed her last summer, and Solar, a 73-year-old grandmother, was rushed to the hospital by ambulance.When Solar was discharged one week later, she received bad news: She would have to wait until March to see a doctor.Waiting seven months for treatment would be unthinkable if Solar had cancer or heart disease. But Solar suffers from severe depression, and waiting that long for help is typical -- and potentially dangerous.Although San Antonio has earned widespread praise for its success in keeping people with mental illness out of jail, patients here routinely wait months to see psychiatrists, who are in short supply across the country. The number of available psychiatrists who specialize in the care of the elderly or children is even smaller.Without routine medical care, patients like Solar, who tried to kill herself in August with an overdose of pills, can quickly deteriorate. Many return to the emergency room. Some don't survive.But Solar was luckier than most.Emergency room staff made an appointment for her at a transitional care clinic at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, which annually treats up to 1,500 patients with serious mental illness until they can find regular care. The clinic helps the mentally ill avoid winding up in the ER, where round-the-clock activity and confusion is ill-suited to the needs of patients who are already agitated, suicidal or psychotic.Communities like San Antonio are increasingly focused on reducing emergency room use by people with mental illness. In addition to being chaotic, emergency rooms are among the most expensive places in the health system to get urgent care.Patients like Solar end up in the ER because they can't find care in the community, and emergency rooms can't legally turn anyone away. The mentally ill can be stranded in the ER for hours, days or even weeks with minimal treatment, because doctors deem them too disabled to discharge, but can't find them an inpatient psychiatric bed, which would allow patients to get more intensive care.More than half of emergency room physicians said their local mental health system has gotten worse in the past year, according to a survey of 1,716 members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, released in October. Seventy-five percent of ER doctors said on their last shift, they saw at least one psychiatric patient who needed to be hospitalized.\"The emergency department becomes the de facto dumping ground for all mental health patients,\" said Gillian Schmitz, a San Antonio emergency physician.The number of ER patients with a mental illness grew from 4.4 million in 2002 to 6.8 million in 2011, an increase of 55 percent, according to a September study in Health Affairs. About 836,000 Americans a year go to the emergency room after harming themselves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 43,000 Americans committed suicide in 2014 -- more than are killed annually in car accidents.The American College of Emergency Physicians devoted much of its annual meeting in October to patients with psychiatric crises.Everyone suffers when people with mental illness are stuck in limbo in the ER, Schmitz said. Other patients face longer waits for care and hospitals lose money. That's because insurers pay emergency rooms only for their initial encounter with a patient, but not for time spent waiting for an inpatient bed.\"Every hour we are holding a psych patient,\" Schmitz said, \"is lost revenue that hospitals could be earning on other medical patients.\"Personalized careSolar's story also shows the progress that people with mental illness can make when they receive prompt and comprehensive care. She has not returned to the ER since beginning treatment in August.Hospital staff scheduled her appointment at the transitional care clinic through a web-based computer system before she left the hospital. Like most patients, Solar was seen within a few days.Solar now meets regularly with a psychiatrist, who manages her medications, and a counselor to discuss her fears.A therapist visits her at home to help organize her medications, which include pills for high blood pressure and cholesterol. The visits are paid for through a Medicaid pilot program, which allows staff to provide extra services for up to five patients who are considered \"high utilizers\" of health care, or patients who are particularly costly to insurers because of repeat trips to the hospital or ER, said Megan Fredrick, the clinic's program manager.Patients with serious mental illness, which can cause cognitive changes similar to dementia, often need help with day-to-day tasks, said psychologist Dawn Velligan, project director at the transitional care clinic. Therapists help patients set alarms that remind them when to take their medicines. They work with patients on calendars and organizational skills, so that clients don't miss appointments.Through a type of therapy called cognitive adaption training, clinic staff teach basic skills, such as how to shop for groceries or take the bus to a medical appointment, Velligan said.Only 2.5 percent of psychiatric patients seen at the transitional care clinic return to the ER within three months, compared to 10 percent of patients who aren't seen at the clinic, Fredrick said.Without the clinic's help, Solar said, she would probably have considered suicide again.\"Sometimes, I get pretty, pretty, pretty depressed,\" said Solar, who was raised by an alcoholic father. Her depression began, Solar said, during an unhappy marriage.Yet for years, Solar suffered in silence. The first time she saw a psychiatrist was after her August suicide attempt.Nationwide, more than half of people with mental illness go without treatment, according to Mental Health America, an advocacy group. The reasons are complex. Many people with mental illness don't realize they're sick, or that treatment can help.  Some patients lack transportation or money to pay for care. About 17 percent of people with a mental illness in the U.S. are uninsured, according to Mental Health America.\"For many of our elderly Hispanic patients, this is the first time they've seen a therapist,\" said Cynthia Sierra, a clinic counselor. \"You're raised not to talk about your problems with strangers. ... You can carry years of burdens and trauma.\"Unsolved problemsFor all its success, the transitional care clinic can't help everyone.With an annual budget of $3.5 million -- provided by a variety of grants and a fund for Medicaid demonstration projects (PDF) -- the clinic sees just a fraction of those who need help.\"We constantly have to beg for money,\" Velligan said.Although the transitional clinic accepts patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance, it can't accept most uninsured patients.Psychiatrist Harsh Trivedi describes the program as a \"Band-Aid\" that fails to address the larger problem of inadequate care for people with mental illness.\"Unfortunately, creating these programs doesn't actually solve the real access issues,\" said Trivedi, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's council on healthcare systems and financing.Trivedi notes that the national shortage of psychiatrists means that even well-insured patients often have to wait for care. Although the overall number of physicians increased 14 percent from 2003 to 2013, the number of psychiatrists fell by 10 percent when adjusted for population growth, according to a July study in Health Affairs.That shortage is projected to worsen over the next decade as large numbers of psychiatrists reach retirement age, said Trivedi, who is also the president and CEO of Sheppard Pratt Health System in Maryland.Many psychiatrists have stopped taking insurance because health plans pay them too little to sustain a practice, Trivedi said.To really help more patients, the country needs to rebuild the mental health system, investing both in outpatient care, more hospitals beds and supportive services, Schmitz said. Instead, states have been steadily slashing mental health budgets for years.\"As a society, we're OK with the fact that someone with depression isn't able to get care,\" Trivedi said. \"That double standard allows some of our most vulnerable people to end up in harm's way.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/mental-health-care-emergency-room/index.html"}
{"_id":"Colleague, transcripts offer closer look at old allegations of racism against Sen. Jeff Sessions","articleText":" (CNN)As the US attorney in Mobile, Alabama, Jeff Sessions was talking over a case one day in the 1980s with two fellow prosecutors.It had to do with a young black man who had been kidnapped and brutally murdered by two members of the Ku Klux Klan.The Klansmen, Henry Hayes and Tiger Knowles, slit the victim's throat and hung his body from a tree. They carried out the attack in retribution for a jury acquitting a black man in the slaying of a white police officer. As Sessions learned that some members of the Klan had smoked marijuana on the evening of the slaying, he said aloud that he thought the KKK was: \"OK until I found out they smoked pot.\"Sessions insists he was joking. But the damage was done.The comment, and others like it, cost him a federal judgeship in 1986 and have been repeated time and again in summary form in newspaper and magazine articles over the years. They are often cited absent the full context in which they were made.The issue has reemerged and could have magnified importance with President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Sessions to become US attorney general.But a CNN examination of the statements at issue in that hearing three decades ago -- a defining moment in Sessions' life — reveals a more nuanced portrait than has sometimes been conveyed over the years.A former colleague who testified in the hearing said he found it ironic that Sessions was being painted as racist for comments that came out while he was literally helping to take on the Klan.\"The way he was portrayed,\" retired Department of Justice prosecutor Barry Kowalski said, \"was very unfair.\"Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was born in Alabama in 1946. He was a child of the segregated South and came of age during the Civil Rights Movement. He went to college in his home state and attended law school there as well.Sessions worked briefly in private practice before signing on with the US Attorney's office in 1975. Six years later, he was appointed US attorney for the Southern District of Alabama by President Ronald Reagan.In 1986, Reagan nominated him to become a federal judge, a lifetime appointment requiring confirmation by the US Senate. It was during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions' comments about the KKK became an issue.Thomas Figures, an assistant US Attorney who worked under Sessions in Mobile, testified that he was present when Sessions made the remark and said he did not regard it as a joke.Figures, who was African-American and passed away last year, also told committee members that Sessions had called him \"boy\" on several occasions and once cautioned him to \"be careful what you say to white folks\" after Figures had spoken harshly to a secretary who was white.Another federal prosecutor, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had called the ACLU and NAACP \"un-American\" and \"communist-inspired.\" According to Hebert, Sessions said the two groups \"forced civil rights down the throats of people.\"Hebert, a veteran civil rights prosecutor, told the committee he had \"very mixed feelings\" about testifying about the conversations that he said had taken place over a matter of years. He said he and Sessions would engage in \"spirited debate\" about civil rights and that he sometimes wondered if Sessions was baiting him with controversial statements. Sessions, he said, \"has a tendency sometimes to just say something, and I believe these comments were along that vein.\"Asked by a committee member whether he considered Sessions a racist, Hebert responded: \"No, I do not.\"The same committee member, Sen. Jeremiah Denton, an Alabama Republican, asked Hebert: \"If Mr. Sessions says he would be fair as a judge, would you believe him?\"\"He is a man of his word,\" Hebert responded, \"and when he says something, I believe him.\"RELATED: Can Trump actually drain the swamp? The answer is murkySome witnesses at the hearing came to Sessions defense on issues of race, including Larry Thompson, an African-American former US Attorney in neighboring Georgia.Thompson testified that he had known Sessions as a colleague and friend for years and had twice shared a hotel room with him on work trips to cut costs.He told the committee he considered Sessions \"a good and honest man untainted by any form of prejudice.\"Kowalski, a prosecutor in the Justice Department's civil right division in Washington, also heard Sessions make the statement about thinking the Ku Klux Klan was OK until learning that some of its members smoked marijuana.Kowalski testified that he considered the comment a joke.In a recent interview with CNN, Kowalski said Sessions played a pivotal role in getting the case against the Klansmen off the ground.Kowalski said the slaying of the young black man, Michael Donald, was initially seen by local authorities as the result of a drug deal gone bad, even though his body was found hanging in a tree across the street from a member of the Klan's residence.Kowalski said Sessions was supportive of his idea to convene a grand jury to investigate whether the killing was racially motivated and therefore qualified as a federal civil rights crime.\"At a time when many US Attorneys in the South were not always welcoming to the Civil Rights Division, Jeff Sessions was,\" said Kowalski, 72, and now retired from the Justice Department. \"Jeff had the vision and the courage and the desire to do right.\"Kowalski, who went on to prosecute the Los Angeles police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King in 1991, described himself as a liberal Democrat who disagreed with most of Sessions' political views. But he said he witnessed no evidence that Sessions was a racist, either in how he spoke or how he treated people.Kowalski said he could not directly contradict Figures. But he said he has struggled to comprehend how Figures took the comment about the Klan seriously.\"I have trouble understanding how he came to that conclusion,\" he said.Kowalski said the allegation that Sessions called Figures \"boy\" or admonished him for the way he spoke to white people was \"inconsistent with the way he behaved when I was around.\"READ MORE: Trump picks Sessions for attorney generalTestifying on his own behalf at the hearing, Sessions acknowledged that he was \"loose with my tongue on occasion\" and may have made comments about the ACLU and NAACP that could have been misconstrued \"but I really did not mean any harm by it.\"He denounced the KKK as a \"force for hatred and bigotry\" and said he was shocked that Figures or anyone else would suggest he thought otherwise.\"I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,\" Session told the committee. \"I am not a racist.\"Leading the charge against Sessions at the time was the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. He called Sessions \"a throwback to a shameful era that I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past\" and \"a disgrace to the Justice Department.\"The committee voted 10-8 against advancing Sessions' nomination to a hearing before the full Senate.Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama in 1994. Two years later, he was elected to the US Senate, where he is now serving his fourth term.In the Senate, he has earned the reputation as one of the institution's most conservative Republicans, taking reliably right of center stances on social and economic issues alike. He is particularly passionate on issues of immigration. In 2007, he was a key player in the successful effort to defeat President George W. Bush's proposed overhaul of national immigration policy, which would have granted legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants.Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said he's known Sessions as a friend and colleague for two decades and has never seen an indication that he's \"motivated by race or religion.\"\"He's just a very conservative guy,\" Graham said. \"He's very sincere and passionate about his beliefs.\"Sessions' positions on civil rights issues have not won him any fans at the NAACP. He's received consistent \"Fs\" on the group's legislative report cards for the past decade and a half.Cornell William Brooks, the group's president, blasted Sessions' nomination, citing what he called a \"very disturbing and recurring theme of hostility to and toward civil rights\" exhibited over his career.He said Sessions nomination along with a top post being awarded to Stephen Bannon were deeply troubling from a civil rights perspective.\"The campaign has been blowing a racist dog whistle,\" Brooks said. \"Now the campaign rhetoric is becoming transition reality.Hebert, the Justice Department prosecutor who testified about Sessions alleged comments about the NAACP and ACLU, said he has had no contact with his former colleague since the hearing three decades ago.But has followed his career through his public comments and votes in the Senate. He said he noticed \"a pattern\" of behavior that has concerned him, including voting against the nomination of several high profile appointees who were non-white.All things considered, Hebert, said, he found it a frightening prospect that Sessions would be appointed attorney general.\"It's a collection of things from over the years. I think it's frightening for people who believe in fairness and equality for him to be running the Justice Department.\"Sessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump for president, which he did in February. Sessions' past -- or the version that emerged from the Judiciary hearing -- was quick to follow.\"Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions had a lengthy history of making racist statements,\" a headline in The Nation charged at the time.The racial allegations made news again when Trump questioned the impartiality of federal judge Gonzalo Curiel based on his Mexican heritage and Sessions declined comment on the matter.\"'Racist' Senator Sticks With Donald Trump,\" a Daily Beast headline proclaimed in June.The negative coverage of Sessions appears to have had little impact on Trump, which is not surprising given his oft-stated distrust and disdain for the media.\"The President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's Attorney General and US Attorney,\" read a statement following a meeting at Trump Tower. \"It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html"}

Seventy-one people were killed and six survived.On Wednesday, a remembrance will be held for the victims at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium in Medellin, Colombia, where Brazil's Chapecoense soccer team had been due to play Colombia's Atletico Nacional team. \"Tomorrow in a symbol of solidarity, we will head to the stadium at 6:45 p wearing white and with candles for the victims,\" the Medellin mayor's office said in a Twitter post.Among the victims were around 20 journalists on the way to cover what was supposed to be a heartwarming chapter in a Cinderella story for a team of unlikely champions. The soccer club, which has risen the ranks in Brazilian soccer and has a devoted national fan base, was set to play in the first leg of the South American Cup finals Wednesday. On Tuesday, hundreds of heartbroken fans gathered at Arena Conda in the team's hometown of Chapeco, Brazil, to mourn their loss. Flags flew at half-staff at Brazil's Planalto Palace.The news sent shock waves through the sports world. The Liverpool Football Club paid tribute to the team before their Tuesday night game.Jet may have run out of fuelInvestigators found the plane's so-called black boxes Tuesday afternoon. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are in \"perfect condition,\" Colombia's civil aviation authority said on Twitter.As air safety officials begin their investigation, the final resting place of the jet's wreckage may prove to be a central clue in determining why the airplane crashed. The lack of apparent fire damage among the wreckage of the deadly crash of LAMIA flight 2933 is pointing investigators to consider fuel starvation as a contributing factor to Monday's crash, said a person familiar with the early inquiry. Chapecoense is sending a seven-person delegation of doctors and legal experts to Colombia. \"Only after their arrival will we be able to confirm the facts of this tragedy,\" the team said on Twitter.'We are praying for everyone'Three soccer players, two crew members and one journalist survived, Colombian authorities said. Among them: defender Alan Luciano Ruschel.In an Instagram post, Ruschel's wife said he was hospitalized in stable condition.\"We are praying for everyone who has not yet been rescued, and for their families,\" Amanda Ruschel wrote. \"It is a complicated and difficult situation. Only God can give us strength.\"What happened?The charter flight took off from Bolivia's Viru Viru International Airport at 6:18 p.m. local time, according to air controller Manuel Palamas.The plane declared an emergency between the municipalities of La Ceja and La Union, according to Colombian aviation officials. The crash occurred in an area called Cerro El Gordo near Medellin, officials said. The Red Cross said they arrived at the scene at 10:30 p.m.Images of the crash show what appear to be damaged parts of the plane. Tattered debris emblazoned with the Chapecoense club's logo was photographed at the crash site.Weather and windSatellite images show that scattered showers and thunderstorms had moved across the region over the previous 12 hours -- though no big storms were nearby, according to CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. There likely would have been turbulence in the region due to intermittent thunderstorms and winds from around the mountains in the region, Guy said.A statement from nearby Jose Maria Cordova airport said the accident site could only be accessed by land because of weather conditions. The Colombian air force had to abort a mission to the accident site due to inclement weather, according to Colombian officials.From Cinderella story to nightmareChapecoense was set to play the Colombian club team Atletico Nacional in the first leg of the South American Cup finals Wednesday.The team, which is ninth in Brazil's Serie A league, has surprised many with its performance in the tournament this year -- ESPNFC billed its semifinal contest as a David versus Goliath match.\"It's a Cinderella football story. They've only been in the top division in Brazil for the last couple of years, and they've reached the Copa Sudamericana final,\" Keir Radnedge of World Soccer magazine told CNN. \"What they have achieved in the last couple of years was just amazing.\"Chapecoense had dreamed of winning the prestigious cup, Plinio David de Nes Filho, the chairman of the team's board, told Brazil's TV Globo on Tuesday.\"The dream was over this morning,\" he said, tearing up as he told the network of the last time he saw the players.\"Yesterday morning I was saying goodbye to them,\" he said. \"They told me they were going in search of the dream, to make this dream a reality.\"Six journalists from Fox Sports Brazil were among the 20 people aboard the aircraft on their way to cover the game, the network said.\"We express our solidarity and stand with the families of our colleagues from Fox Sports Brazil and of the players for the Chapecoense Club who perished in this tragedy,\" Fox Sports said.The lesser-known Chapecoense club was founded in 1973 and had steadily risen up the ranks in recent years.Team officials liked to say that it succeeded due to good management and a strategic vision, said Plus55, a Brazilian news site.\"Few remembered the name of this forgotten team,\" CONMEBOL, the governing body for soccer in South America, said of Chapecoense. \"Now the whole continent knows it.\"The team, whose stadium wasn't even big enough to host a final by CONMEBOL regulations, was vying to become the first Brazilian club to win the South American Cup final since 2008.As word of the crash spread, Brazilian soccer great Pele was among the many athletes and fans expressing their condolences Tuesday.\"The Brazilian football family is in mourning,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"This is a tragedy. I send my condolences to the families of the deceased. Rest in peace.\"CNN en Español's Fernando Ramos reported from Colombia, CNN's Marilia Brocchetto and Catherine E.

{"_id":"Colombia plane crash: Jet ran out of fuel, pilot said","articleText":" (CNN)[Breaking news, posted 3:12 p.m. ET] The pilot of LAMIA Flight 2933, which crashed near Medellin, Colombia, said, \"The plane is in total electric failure and without fuel,\" according to two sources familiar with the investigation who heard audio recordings of conversations between the flight crew and air traffic control. The audio was published in Colombian media. Seventy-one people were killed in the crash, including members of a Brazilian soccer team.[Previous story, posted 1:04 p.m. ET]As air safety officials begin their investigation into the deadly crash of LAMIA flight 2933 near Medellin, Colombia, the final resting place of the jet's wreckage may prove to be a central clue in determining why the airplane crashed.The crash killed at least 71 people during a charter flight to Medellin, including members of the Brazilian Chapecoense soccer squad on its way to the Copa Sudamericana finals. Three players, two crew members and one journalist survived, Colombian authorities said.The lack of apparent fire damage among the wreckage of the British Aerospace Avro RJ85 is pointing investigators to consider fuel starvation as one of the contributing factors to Monday's crash, a person familiar with the early inquiry said.Fuel starvation occurs when fuel is cut off from the engines, causing them to stop running. It can be caused by a number of factors including a fuel leak, internal icing, failure of the fuel pumps or gauges, or crew error.Alfredo Bocanegra, director of the Colombia Civil Aviation Authority, said even though a preliminary investigation pointed to an electrical problem, the possibility the plane ran out of fuel has not been ruled out, CNN Italian affiliate ANSA reported.  However, Bocanegra said investigators would have to ascertain why the aircraft didn't have enough fuel, because it was just 5 miles away from the airport.The Colombian Civil Aviation Authority declined to comment further on technical details. Photos released by Civil Aviation Authorities showed debris from the four-engine Avro RJ85 strewn across a hillside with no apparent charring amongst the wreckage.\"We do know there was no fire when the plane impacted the ground, which may be one of the reasons why there are survivors from this terrible tragedy,\" said Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of Airlineratings.com.Such a wreckage pattern in past investigations has suggested there was little or no fuel remaining on the aircraft. Starvation of fuel is \"very, very rare in commercial aviation terms because there are so many checks and balances to make sure you have enough fuel on board,\" said Grant Brophy, an air safety investigator.Brophy cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from footage and photos from the scene.Investigators will reconstruct the flight's final hours using data collected from the flight data and voice recorder, as well as maintenance and manufacturing records. The so-called \"black boxes\" were recovered early Tuesday and were in excellent condition, according to Colombian aviation officials.The charter flight took off from Bolivia's Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz at 6:18 p.m. local time, according to air controller Manuel Palamas.According to tracking data from FlightRadar24, the aircraft entered a racetrack-shaped holding pattern at around 20,000 feet before it crashed. Reports suggested the crew had previously communicated with air traffic control a problem with the jet's electrical system. Air accident investigators in the United Kingdom, where the plane was manufactured, are dispatching to the crash site to aid Colombian authorities in determining what happened.The Avro series of regional jets were once a mainstay of the regional operations of small US and European airlines, but were retired in favor of more efficient two-engine jets and propeller planes. The jet that crashed Monday flew with US regional carrier Mesaba Airlines when it was first delivered in 1999, according to the Aviation Safety Network.According to a July 2016 report by Boeing, the Avro family of aircraft has suffered 14 accidents in which the aircraft was a total loss, including seven with fatalities. Monday's crash is the eighth due to noncriminal acts.The crash marred what has been an otherwise exemplary year for aviation safety. Fatalities due to air crashes in 2016 are at less than half the 10-year average.

{"_id":"Colombia, FARC rebels sign revised peace deal","articleText":" (CNN)The rebel leader waved his arms in the air as the crowd cheered. The President smiled at the audience, clenching in his hand a pen made from bullets.Both men signed a historic peace agreement, then shook hands. It was a moment of diplomatic deja-vu. Thursday marked the second time this year that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño have signed a peace deal aimed at ending Latin America's longest war.In October, Colombian voters rejected the first version of the agreement in a national referendum, sending negotiators back to the table.This time, the revised peace agreement will go to Congress for approval. And it's likely to pass, since Santos' coalition holds the balance of power in the legislative body.\"This new accord is better than the one we signed in Cartagena,\" Santos said after signing the deal Thursday. \"It is better because we picked the hopes and observations of the majority of the people.\"A somber ceremonyIn Thursday's ceremony, the leaders used the same pen they had used to sign the deal the last time around -- made from recycled bullets once used in the conflict.But the ceremony was more somber than the celebration in September, when a choir sang \"Ode to Joy\" as officials from around the world watched, dressed in white, to symbolize peace.On Thursday, the crowd chanted, \"Yes, it was possible!\" after the deal was signed.Londoño, better known by his alias, Timochenko, began a speech Thursday with a declaration of peace: \"Let words be the only weapons of Colombians.\"He went on to thank the Roman Catholic Church, the countries that were involved in years of peace talks and even US President-elect Donald Trump.\"The people of this country are tired of violence, intolerance and stigmas,\" he said. \"They want and demand profound change from the political customs that are corruption, lies, and deceit.\"How is this deal different?The conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the government has gone on for more than half a century and claimed more than 220,000 lives.Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year for \"his resolute efforts\" to end the civil war, which is the longest running conflict in the region.But critics are already slamming the new deal, arguing that the changes are largely cosmetic. Some have also criticized the government for sending the deal to Congress rather than holding another referendum.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/americas/colombia-farc-peace-deal-signed/index.html"}
{"_id":"Colombian government, FARC reach new peace agreement","articleText":" (CNN)Colombia's government and the FARC rebel group will sign a peace deal on Thursday, President Juan Manuel Santos has announced, following the collapse in October of a previous agreement to end the five-decade insurgency.Santos, who announced the new deal in a televised address late Tuesday, said the signed pact would need to go to Congress for approval. Santos' coalition holds the balance of power in Congress so the deal is likely to pass.A peace deal negotiated earlier this year with FARC rebels was narrowly defeated by Colombian voters. Many voters were angered by what they saw as insufficient punishment for those who perpetrated a litany of crimes against their people.Santos met on Monday with former president Alvaro Uribe Velez, who took a leading role in the campaign against the previous deal. The two spent six hours discussing the agreement. \"Lives have been lost and many more lives are at risk. We couldn't forgive ourselves if we hadn't acted promptly and firmly to correct that situation. We need to act. There's no time to waste,\" Santos said in a televised statement, adding the deal would be signed at the Teatro Colon in Bogota. No referendumSantos made clear that the government wanted to avoid another plebiscite.\"The immense majority of the sectors of civil society, the youth, the church and political sectors have indicated their concern of a new plebiscite. A new campaign would polarize the country in a dangerous way, and this is a moment for union and not division. I am in agreement with them. My job as President is to promote union, not polarization,\" Santos said. Uribe had argued the previous deal offered impunity to FARC fighters, accusing Santos of conceding to FARC demands.\"Although the President of the republic calls us radicals, we have accepted that in other areas there were modifications which we have thought convenient and we have said that there is a third category of issues that could be adjusted here in Congress,\" Uribe told Colombian news network RCN.\"The serious thing is that the government does not give in to impunity to drug trafficking.\"The civil conflict that has carried on for half a century has brought terror, misery and death to generations of Colombians, claiming more than 220,000 lives.More than 5 million people in a country of 47 million have been displaced.Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year for \"his resolute efforts\" to end the country's civil war.CNN's Marilia Brocchetto and Angela Dewan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/americas/colombia-farc-peace-agreement/index.html"}
{"_id":"Comedian with cerebral palsy talks humor, Oprah and giving back","articleText":" (CNN)For Zach Anner, humor was the key to dealing with his cerebral palsy when he was growing up. \"My childhood was great because my family has an amazing sense of humor, and it was just all making videos and jokes and doing skits and things,\" said Anner, who credits his parents with not allowing his disability to get in his way. \"My parents instilled in me a sense of self that I was more than just a diagnosis or a condition,\" he said. \"For me, cerebral palsy wasn't the biggest deal, because I always had it. You know, you always work with what you got.\"Doctors diagnosed Anner's cerebral palsy when he was about a year old. \"My eyes were crossed as a baby, and they're like, 'We'll just correct those,' and ... it was botched. I like to joke the doctor had previously only performed eye surgeries on giraffes and stuff, and I was his first human, and it just didn't go so well.\"The Texas comedian, 32, first realized that he loved making people laugh during a telethon as a child. He had a short speech he was supposed to deliver, but instead he just repeated \"ladies and gentlemen\" over and over, and the crowd started laughing. \"I was this adorable little 4-year-old in a wheelchair, and they didn't expect me to go up there and just do something like that,\" he said. \"I realized that people's expectations of me could also be used as a tool to disarm them and sort of catch people off guard. And that was a valuable lesson.\"I decided pretty early that I wanted to do some stuff with film and to make people laugh because I had tried other jobs and failed miserably,\" Anner said.Those early jobs included working at a bookstore and at a theme park, where he said he was probably the worst employee they ever had. \"I was basically the person at Disney World that was in charge of clearing the park when it was closed. ... I was the guy ... telling them to 'get the hell out and have a magical day.' \"Then, in 2010, Anner's mom persuaded him to try out for a reality show to win his own TV program. \"She was like, 'Oprah (Winfrey) is launching a new network, and she's gonna give away a TV show, and you should totally audition for it.' \" So he submitted an audition video. \"The whole video is me telling Oprah how I would suck at hosting most shows. I'm a terrible cook, I'm a terrible fashion show host ... and I wouldn't be good at doing a fitness show (that) shows me basically trying to do yoga in my underwear.\"\"And that video ended up being seen by millions of people. So I guess the lesson there is that me in my underwear is very appealing to most people.\"Anner became a contestant on the reality show, \"Your OWN Show: Oprah's Search for the Next TV Star.\" As part of the competition, he was interviewed by the media mogul herself. \"I guess I stood out during that process because I actually asked Oprah questions instead. I sort of turned the tables. Since Oprah Winfrey is sitting in front of you, you better ask some damn questions.\"He won the competition and got his own program, called \"Rollin' with Zach.\" It lasted only  six episodes before it was canceled. But Anner sees it all as a positive. \"I think Oprah was definitely a huge turning point in my life, because that was the first time I realized that I could do this as a career, and I could actually have an impact on people's lives.\"These days, Anner spends a lot of time with his YouTube channel. One of his series is called \"Workout Wednesday.\" \"(It's) a fitness show where I try and tell people how to try to achieve a body like mine.\"He produces his videos with a lot of help from family and friends. \"Any success that I've had in my career is a direct result of the people that work with me and believe in what I'm doing, and it's a real collaborative effort. So my friends, my brother, they are all helping make these videos possible. I'm not a one-man show, obviously.\"This year, Anner released his first book, \"If At Birth You Don't Succeed.\" \"Basically, (it's) my memoir, which is a collection of really embarrassing stories that have life lessons to them.\"Anner's goals now include giving back to the less fortunate. He recently returned from a trip to Nicaragua. \"We were doing some work with a charity called Wheels for Humanity over there that gives wheelchairs to people in third world countries who wouldn't normally have access to them,\" he said.And he's an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation. \"I'm helping educate people about CP and have a fun conversation about it and normalize it in a way that I don't think we've seen before.\"Anner says he is now becoming more comfortable as a role model. \"I used to be very afraid of being an advocate and being pigeonholed as this guy with CP, because there is a lot more to me than my condition. But I also realize that there's a lot of people out there that don't have the platform that I have.\" He believes he's making a difference. \"I've gotten so many notes from parents who say 'My kid has CP, and you give us hope,' which is great.\" But Anner's main focus is still being a funny guy. \"I hope to make people laugh and maybe make them think a little bit,\" he said. \"If they are inspired by what I do, then that's great, but that's never the focus.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/turning-points-zach-anner/index.html"}

{"_id":"Complaints preceded fatal school bus crash, records show","articleText":" (CNN)The driver in a Chattanooga school bus crash that killed six children had previously alarmed students, parents and faculty with his driving, according to complaints obtained by CNN.A principal expressed concern about Johnthony Walker's driving twice in the weeks before the crash, students claimed he was trying to injure them and a parent, responding to complaints he had cursed at children and tried to hurt them with his driving, threatened to beat Walker up, the records allege.Last week, the 24-year-old Walker was driving students home from school when his bus slammed into a tree at such a speed that the vehicle split in half on impact.Thirty-seven children were on the bus. Six of them, ages 6 to 10, died. Dozens were injured. A city mourned. Walker faces multiple vehicular homicide charges, as well as charges of reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Investigators have said that while no traces of alcohol or drugs were found in Walker's blood, he was driving down an unapproved bus route at well over the speed limit. School documents show that Walker, who had been in an accident two months prior, had drawn a series of complaints that raise questions about whether the children riding the bus were safe in the driver's care. Principal: Walker was 'driving way too fast'Going back to at least September, parents and students had complained to Hamilton County Department of Education employees about the driver's alleged disregard for children's safety, records show.One parent, in a letter to school officials, accused Walker of cursing at children and intentionally slamming his brakes to make them hit their heads and fall out of their seats, according to records. The parent pledged to \"beat his ass my damn self\" if his driving didn't improve, records show.Earlier this month, school officials received reports that the driver had argued with students and cursed at them. After Walker grew frustrated one day, the driver stated that \"he did not care about the students and proceeded to tell the students he did not care about them,\" a school system staffer recalled.On November 8, Woodmore Elementary School principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said Walker was \"driving way too fast when he pulled out of our school.\" The next week, five days before the fatal crash, she again expressed concerns in an email with school officials. Six students had told school employees the driver was swerving and \"purposely trying to cause them to fall,\" the principal said.According to school records, at least two students wrote letters to officials expressing concerns for their safety. One student claimed the driver \"was doing sharp turns and he made me fly over to the next seat.\" A second student said the bus felt like it would \"flip over\" given how fast it traveled. \"He makes (people) hit their head,\" the second student wrote.At a press conference Monday, Hamilton County Interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly said officials could not make any further comments about Walker, citing the ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and Chattanooga police. Driver filed complaints against studentsThe daily route for the No. 366 bus had become a struggle for Walker, records show.He complained to officials that throughout the fall, students failed to heed his safety instructions and treated him with disrespect. He said he tried to reason with some students, but to no avail.It led him in November to file nearly a dozen reports about his treatment. All in one day.Walker reported some student misconduct to school officials, saying students were facing the wrong way on the bus, stood on their seats and goofed around, all while the bus was in motion. He threatened them with writeups, but his threats to report them seemed to do little to stop their behavior, he claimed.In another episode, Walker also cautioned another group of children who stood up on the bus that they could get hurt if he needed to brake. When they didn't listen, he vowed to write them up once he obtained the necessary forms, which were not with him at the time. School officials ended up pulling surveillance tapes to review his driving on the days in question.Criminal charges, civil lawsuit pendingWalker still sits behind bars. He's slated to go before a judge for an initial hearing Tuesday.It isn't clear if he has obtained a defense attorney or if the court will appoint one. In addition, Walker faces a lawsuit filed by the family of 8-year-old Jamar Boling, one of the children injured in the accident. Durham School Services, a company that transports more than 1 million students daily at schools across the United States, including the students at Woodmore Elementary, was also named in the lawsuit.The company's CEO issued a brief statement via YouTube saying that his employees are cooperating with all investigations. \"My responsibility now is to look for answers, answers about why this tragedy occurred and answers for how we can make sure that this never, ever happens again,\" David A. Duke said. Duke said he could not comment further because he did not want to compromise the investigations. A representative for National Express, the parent company for Durham School Services, told CNN on Monday that the company does not comment on pending litigation. CNN's Lechelle Benken, Eliott C.

Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, told the Clinton campaign they believe there is a questionable trend of Clinton performing worse in counties that relied on electronic voting machines compared to paper ballots and optical scanners, according to the source.The group informed John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, and Marc Elias, the campaign's general counsel, that Clinton received 7% fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic voting machines, which the group said could have been hacked.  Their group told Podesta and Elias that while they had not found any evidence of hacking, the pattern needs to be looked at by an independent review.Neither Halderman nor John Bonifaz, an attorney also pressing the case, responded to requests for comment on Tuesday evening. Their urging was first reported by New York magazine.A message left with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team also was not immediately returned.There were widespread concerns about hacking ahead of this month's election, including the Obama administration accusing Russia of attempting to breach voter registration data.

The problem: Some of the children were too young to know their parents' names and phone numbers, adding to the anxiety of parents who weren't sure if their children were dead or hospitalized. The children aboard the bus ranged from kindergartners to fifth graders.\"They had no IDs with them when they arrived. None of the parents were present when they arrived. And they were all wearing uniforms when they arrived,\" said Dr. Darvey Koller, medical director of the hospital's emergency room. \"Many of them were scared or too dazed to talk to us. And because of their young age, many of them were unable to spell their names, did not know their birth dates, or even their parents' names.\" When asked for their parents' names, several of the children replied, \"Mama.\" Outside the operating rooms, dozens of panicked parents flooded the scene, uncertain what happened to their children.\"At one point, we think we had a hundred family members in our hospital,\" pediatric surgeon Dr. Lisa Smith said. So how did the hospital match families with their children? In some cases, staff members took photos of the children and showed them to teachers from Woodmore Elementary School to help identify the wounded.In other cases, parents showed cell phone pictures of their children to the hospital staff. That worked well until one poignant moment, when parents started showing photos of children not found at the hospital. That's when their hope descended to grief. Five children died Monday. One died two days later. Mother of school bus crash victim: 'He was my only child'But one teacher stepped forward to share one last happy photo with the family of a child who died, said Jan Keys, chief nursing executive at Erlanger Health System. Earlier in the day, students were enjoying holiday festivities during lunch. The teacher took a photo of that child.\"It was a very happy situation. They were celebrating Thanksgiving,\" Keys said. \"So it's very touching to see that, and I think it was helpful for the family to know what the last moments (at school) might have been.\" CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta, and CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Chattanooga.

{"_id":"Conjoined Twins Fast Facts","articleText":" (CNN)Here's some background information about conjoined twins.Conjoined twins are physically connected to one another at some point on their bodies.Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.About 70% of conjoined twins are female. Conjoined twins are identical - they are the same sex.The form of conjoined twinning refers to the point where the twins are joined. The top five, starting with the most frequent: thoracopagus (heart, liver, intestine), omphalopagus (liver, biliary tree, intestine), pygopagus (spine, rectum, genitourinary tract), ischiopagus (pelvis, liver, intestine, genitourinary tract), and craniopagus (brain, meninges). (American Pediatric Surgical Association)Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.   The term \"Siamese twins\" originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, a set of conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. They lived to age 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.In 1955, neurosurgeon Dr. Harold Voris of Mercy Hospital in Chicago performs the first successful procedure separating conjoined twins joined at the head.

{"_id":"Conservatives let themselves dream big about Scalia's replacement","articleText":"Washington (CNN)As President-elect Donald Trump considers the current Supreme Court vacancy, Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and other legal giants kicked off a conference bringing together judicial conservatives from all over the country. What a difference a few weeks makes. The subject of the conference, sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society, was the jurisprudence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But the talk in the hallways was devoted to the unexpected election results and the pending Supreme Court nomination -- expected to be a conservative who would continue Scalia's legacy. Indeed, several of the judges Trump is considering for the Supreme Court were milling about in the hallways, dodging journalists and moderating various panels. \"It's not the wake we thought it was going to be,\" said Randy Barnett, a professor of Georgetown law who was an architect of the first legal challenge against the Affordable Care Act.The Republican blueprint for Supreme Court nominations John Malcolm of the conservative Heritage Foundation said that when he was planning to come to the conference a few weeks ago, he thought the lawyers might join together to \"commiserate\" Clinton's win. Instead, he said, \"we are here to celebrate.\" Luther Strange III, the attorney general of Alabama spoke about the dozens of lawsuits he and other Republican state attorneys general filed against the Obama administration in areas such as immigration, transgender rights and the Clean Power Plan. \"We are no longer the last line of defense,\" Strange said. \"We are now the spear.\" The annual event, always popular, held several panels with standing room only crowds. Malcolm pointed to attendees wearing lanyards attached to event ID cards and joked that some of the people populating the rooms should have their resumes attached to the lanyard. \"Many are surprised that they have a shot at a position in government,\" he said. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, met with Trump in New York on Wednesday. After that meeting, Leo offered few clues to the gathered journalists outside of Trump Tower. \"I would say that he's looking for someone who is independent, courageous, smart, very high quality,\" Leo said. He added that he thought Trump would move forward \"as swiftly as he can to make sure that the court's full 9-member bench is restored.\" The Republican blueprint for Supreme Court nominationsTrump has often repeated that he will seek a nominee in Scalia's mold to take the seat. He's released a list of 21 potential successors -- all of whom are very conservative. Of that list, a short list is already being circulating in judicial circles emphasizing two qualities: a commitment to principles of limited government and experience outside of Washington. \"All the people who I know on the short list are going to be sympathetic to interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning,\" said Barnett. Ilya Shapiro, who works for the libertarian Cato Institute noted that the event would have been very different had Clinton won. \"It's cautious optimism now,\" he said. \"We dodged one bullet, and things should go in the right direction now.\" Judges Diane Sykes, William Pryor, Thomas Hardiman, David Stras and Joan Larsen moderated panels but they kept their comments to Scalia's jurisprudence. In his remarks Thursday morning, Alito highlighted his late colleague's contributions, not only in the areas of constitutional interpretation and the structure of government, but also Scalia's impact on hot button issues such as the Second Amendment and freedom of religion. \"We've had 26 argument days\" since Scalia's death, Alito said. \"On every single one of them there has been a palpable emptiness.\" Thomas was more forward-looking in a speech Thursday evening. Reading through some of Scalia's most well-known opinions, Thomas suggested that his late colleague's words should carry on.\"Justice Scalia has done his part,\" Thomas said. And then he charged the audience with the responsibility of ensuring \"that these words spoken and written by Justice Scalia\" not be \"the final words.\"\"Rather, they ought to be a prologue,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/conservative-lawyers-cheer-trump-scalia-replacement/index.html"}

{"_id":"Convicted London serial killer sought his victims on gay dating sites","articleText":"London (CNN)Even by the grim standards of serial killings, the details of the crimes are appalling. A chef met a series of younger men on gay dating sites and lured them with the promise of romance or sex to his east London apartment, where he poisoned their drinks and then raped them as they lay unconscious and dying.He then dumped their bodies around his neighborhood, planting drugs and even suicide notes on them to make it appear as if they had overdosed, police and prosecutors said.On Wednesday a London jury found Stephen Port, 41, guilty of the murders of four young men over a 15-month span between June 2014 and September 2015. Port also was convicted of drugging or sexually assaulting seven other victims who survived.\"He bought drugs on a regular basis and used them to stupefy his victims without their knowledge so he could rape or sexually assault them,\" said Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan Police after the verdict. \"Four families have been left devastated by the loss of their loved ones in such awful circumstances and seven more men have suffered horrific sexual assaults, the trauma of which will stay with them for a long time.\"Prosecutors said Port targeted victims on Grindr and other gay dating sites and apps, then plied them with drinks laced with fatal amounts of the drug GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, otherwise known as liquid ecstasy.He then raped them while they were unconscious and before they died, according to testimony at the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, more commonly known as Old Bailey. Port, who worked as a chef in a bus garage, then dragged the bodies of his victims out into the street and left them slumped against walls not far from his flat in the Barking neighborhood of east London, police said. He denied all the charges against him but was found guilty of the murders of fashion student Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; fellow chef Daniel Whitworth, 21; and forklift truck driver Jack Taylor, 25. The Old Bailey court also heard testimony on how Port embarked on an elaborate cover-up of the murders, disposing of victims' mobile phones and repeatedly lying to police. He planted a fake suicide note in Whitworth's hand and tried to frame him for the death of Kovari. The jury ultimately convicted Port of a total of 22 charges against 11 male victims, including four additional rapes, four sex assaults and 10 counts of administering a substance with the intent to stupefy. He was acquitted of three additional counts of rape.\"We can't rule out the fact there may be other victims out there who suffered at Port's hands and have yet to come forward,\" Cundy said. \"We would appeal for them to contact us as soon as possible.\"Port is scheduled to be sentenced Friday and faces up to life in prison.\"We are bereft at the loss of such a clever, talented and much loved boy,\" said Mandy Pearson, Whitworth's stepmother, in a statement read outside the courthouse. \"The fight goes on until all our questions are answered. It has been difficult to say the least and has had a huge impact on our lives, which will never be the same again. We are emotionally and physically exhausted.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/europe/gay-serial-killer-stephen-port-conviction/index.html"}

{"_id":"Conway: Trump backers feel 'betrayed' by Romney consideration","articleText":"Washington (CNN)One of President-elect Donald Trump's top advisers said Sunday that his loyal supporters across the country feel \"betrayed\" that he is considering one of his most vicious critics, Mitt Romney, for secretary of state. \"I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position,\" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\" She added: \"It's just breathtaking in scope and intensity the type of messages I've received from all over the country ... the number of people who feel betrayed to think that Gov. Romney would get the most prominent Cabinet post after he went so far out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.\"Conway first opened a window on the infighting in Trump's transition over who should win the powerful role as the nation's top diplomat, when she tweeted on Thanksgiving about concerns with Romney. \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state,\" she tweeted, including a link to a Politico story.Romney has been scrapping behind the scenes with Rudy Giuliani for the post, although alternative options have emerged, including former Gen. David Petraeus and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker.Conway said Sunday that much of the anger, which has boiled over in public, stems from the personal attacks Romney lobbed at him. \"There was the Never Trump movement and then there was Mitt Romney he gave speeches against Donald Trump, he attacked his character,\" Conway said. Ana Navarro, a Republican Trump critic and CNN political commentator, registered her surprise at the interview on Twitter, saying: \"Astounding to hear K. Conway, who has the ability to tell Trump privately, trash possibility of Romney as Sec of State publicly on @CNNSotu.\"But Conway fired back: \"I did tell him privately. And I'll respect his decision. Point is the volume & intensity of grassroots resistance to Romney is breathtaking.\"The fight between Romney, the Republican Party's 2012 nominee, and Trump was nasty and personal.After Romney said he didn't expect Trump to win the GOP nomination and called some of the real estate mogul's past comments \"childish in some respects,\" Trump tweeted: \".@MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible \"choke\" loss to Obama!\" A few months later, Romney unloaded on Trump, calling him a \"phony, a fraud\" and asking Republicans to unite against him. Trump fired back, saying that he could have forced Romney to his knees in 2012 when Romney sought his endorsement. \"He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees' -- he would have dropped to his knees,\" Trump said.Romney's speech sparked a furious back-and-forth that only ended after the election when, in a stunning turn, the two met to discuss Romney becoming secretary of state. Since that meeting, conservative backers of Trump have been openly bashing Romney, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Reince Preibus, Trump's incoming chief of staff, downplayed any fighting behind the scenes, suggesting that picking Romney would make for a good \"team of rivals\" for Trump.\"He's going to be making the best decision for the American people. It isn't a matter of warfare. I mean, there's a lot of opinions about this and, yes, it is sort of a 'team of rivals' concept if you were to go towards the Gov. Romney concept,\" Priebus said on Fox News' \"Fox News Sunday.\"Priebus declined to say whether Romney should publicly apologize for his attacks on Trump. He also spoke highly of Petraeus, as a possible third option. \"I don't think anyone could say that David Petraeus isn't a very bright, calculated, smart person, and these are the types of conversations that I think the American people would expect of an incoming president that's trying to make the best decisions possible for everyone out there across the country,\" Priebus said.Petraeus was sentenced to two years probation last year after he revealed he had provided top secret information to his biographer, whom he was having an affair with. Trump often held out Petraeus on the campaign trail as evidence that Hillary Clinton should face prosecution for her use of a private email server.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/politics/conway-trump-romney-betrayed/index.html"}

{"_id":"Could you pass China's grueling, 5-hour civil service exam?","articleText":"Beijing (CNN)Imagine taking a five-hour exam just to get a job interview. That's what nearly 1.5 million people did in China Sunday, taking the country's grueling civil service entrance exam, or Guokao. Test-takers had two hours to answer 135 multiple-choice questions on topics covering language, mathematics, logic, politics, law and culture. That was followed by 3 hours of essay questions. The exam is only held once a year, so for those taking part, it's do or die. They are competing for 27,000 jobs. The odds of getting one -- after the exam and a subsequent interview -- are about 55 to 1. Preparations Wang Caizhen, 23, is one of those people. A graduate of Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University, she took the exam in hopes of an entry-level job with China's Ministry of Commerce. She spent nearly four months studying for the test, reviewing old questions, taking mock exams and attending preparatory classes on the weekend.\"The questions on the test were different from the exercises I did to prepare for it,\" Wang said, adding that the timing of the exam was \"very tight.\" In order to complete the aptitude test in the time limit, \"you have to train to answer each question within 50 seconds,\" she said. \"One of the (essay) questions was about modern governance based on the ancient Chinese understanding and metaphor of water.\" Career opportunities Civil service jobs in China are known as the \"golden rice bowl\" due to their stable pay and generous benefits. The jobs can also lead to membership in the ruling Communist Party, which brings additional prestige. Those hoping to take the exam must have at least a junior college degree, and be between the ages of 18 and 35. They have to choose the jobs they're interested in when they register. Wang's desired role pays only 6,000 yuan ($870) a month, but includes benefits such as Beijing housing registration, free accommodation and free food at the office canteen. Such jobs are especially appealing at a time when economic growth in China has been steadily slowing. \"The civil service is a good career option because it's stable,\" she said. For now, Wang and other applicants will have to wait. Results of the exam won't come out until January, and if they've scored high enough, the actual job interviews will take place in February or March.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/asia/china-civil-service-exam/index.html"}
{"_id":"Court documents show signs of trouble at Ghost Ship before fire ","articleText":"Oakland, California (CNN)As investigators sift through the debris of the charred Oakland warehouse that became a mass grave for at least 36 people, court documents obtained by CNN provide an unsettling glimpse of life in the facility before it caught fire Friday evening.The documents are requests for restraining orders filed by and against Derick Ion Almena, the leaseholder of the cavernous structure known as the Ghost Ship.They contain allegations of theft, assault and intimidation in which Almena is in one case the alleged aggressor and, in the other, a victim. The accounts, while unproven, add to a chaotic portrait of the way the building was allegedly maintained and managed prior to the deadly blaze. Attempts to reach Almena were unsuccessful. In a brief interview aired on NBC's \"Today Show\" Tuesday, he said he was \"incredibly sorry\" for what had happened at the warehouse.At the time of the fire, the site was the subject of a pending investigation by Oakland's Building and Planning Department. Officials were looking into complaints that the property had piles of garbage and had been improperly remodeled for residential use. Officials also said the dance party going on at the facility when the fire broke out was held without a permit.The blaze is now under criminal investigation. Officials have not determined its cause or origin, but conditions at the site prior to the fire -- and how it was being used -- could be factors in determining culpability.2 men asked for restraining orderOne of the restraining order requests was filed by a man who said he rented space from Almena for a New Year's Eve event hosted at the warehouse two years ago. Phillipe Lewis wrote that he was accosted by Almena when he returned to the warehouse to clean up on January 2, 2015. He said Almena demanded additional money, stole his sound system, physically assaulted him and threatened to go get a gun. Lewis' friend, Matthew Elvey, began to record the alleged assault on his iPhone, according to his own request for a restraining order against Almena.Elvey said his phone was taken from him and that he was \"beaten by Derick's staff at his direction.\"\"My shoulder was pulled from the socket. I was kicked in the forehead, shoulder and jaw,\" Elvey wrote. Oakland police arrived at the scene in the aftermath of the disturbance. Elvey declined medical treatment and no one was arrested, according to a police report. The request for a restraining order was dismissed, according to court records. Neither Lewis nor Almena appeared in court,  records show. It's unclear whether Elvey failed to appear or if he did show up but asked that the matter be dismissed.Elvey declined comment on the case. Lewis did not return a phone call seeking comment. Almena asks for restraining orderAbout a month after that incident, Almena filed a request for a restraining order against a woman who had once rented an art space in the warehouse but who had since begun \"attempting to illegally squat\" there, according to the documents filed. He accused the woman of trying to provoke him by pushing him, slandering him, and making false accusations to child protective services about the way he cared for his kids.  Almena referred to the woman in court papers by two different last names. CNN is not identifying her, pending confirmation of her identity.  Almena said the woman threatened to have her sons \"come over and blow my [expletive] head off.\" At one point, he alleged, he was chased by the woman and her son, who was armed with a gun. Another time, he alleged, the woman's son kicked out the window of a car Almena's wife and young son were in. The broken glass cut his son, he said.The woman, Almena wrote, is \"extorting me with fear tactics to avoid past due rental fees and legal eviction.\" He sought a restraining order for himself, his wife and three children, then ages 11, 6 and 4.\"My family is in fear,\" Almena wrote. The request for a restraining order was denied when neither party showed up in court, records show.CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/us/oakland-fire-derick-almena-ghost-ship-life/index.html"}

So they sent him a special message during the broadcast at the start of the games.\"We wish you were here, man. We're gonna try to win this gold for you ... you know you're a part of our family,\" said star forward Kevin Durant. \"Keep the faith, and we gonna do this for you,\" added teammate Carmelo Anthony.The upbeat sportscaster has inspired players, coaches and fans with his \"never give up\" attitude during a grueling two-and-a-half year battle with cancer.Known for his lively interviews and colorful outfits at NBA games, the 65-year-old Sager said he realized something was amiss at a game in April 2014.\"I ran into the doctor for the [Dallas Mavericks], and he looked at me and said, 'Sager, what's wrong?' I go, 'Doc, I don't know.' He says, 'You've got to go to the emergency room.'\"When Sager arrived at the hospital his red-blood cell count was so low he was near death. The veteran reporter for TBS and TNT (both networks, like CNN, are part of Turner Broadcasting), who had never missed a day of work in his life, was suddenly sidelined. The diagnosis was grim: acute myeloid leukemia.\"Your world just comes crumbling down. It's devastating,\" said his wife, Stacy Sager. \"What he needed to do was just be strong and know that he and I can fight this together.\"A son steps upSager went through chemo and needed a bone marrow transplant. As it turned out, his son Craig was a perfect match. \"It's a bond that you can't talk about or describe with a son,\" Sager said. \"Now I was relying on him, and I needed him.\"The transplant was successful, and Sager couldn't wait to return to the court. He received a standing ovation from fans at his first game back in March of 2015. \"It was just an incredible night,\" he said. \"I thought that was it. I'd beat cancer, and I'd never have to worry about it again.\"But the cancer came back.Sager's only option this time was a grueling clinical trial of 14 days of chemo at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

{"_id":"Crawling has some fitness experts going gaga","articleText":" (CNN)On any given morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, Danielle Johnson can be found crawling down the hallways of her Rochester, Minnesota, home. It may sound bizarre, but Johnson crawls every day to strengthen her core muscle groups.\"You can crawl in many ways. You can crawl on your hands and knees. You can also prop up on your toes and just hover, one or two inches above the ground, which is really going to pull in those core muscles and work those muscles effectively,\" said Johnson, a physical therapist at the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program.\"Then, as you start to move, you're working on your shoulder girdle, you're working on your hips,\" she said. \"If I could give one exercise to almost everybody, this would be it.\"Crawling has been used as a physical therapy tool, Johnson said, and now it has been adopted for strengthening and fitness.The idea of turning crawling like a baby into exercise has been championed by the training system Original Strength, which repurposes fundamental movements into a fitness regimen.According to Original Strength, when you crawl, you're \"pressing reset\" on your central nervous system and revisiting the mobility patterns you learned as a baby. Patterns such as crawling not only require motor skills, they involve the vestibular system, a sensory system associated with balance and spatial orientation, said Justin Klein, a chiropractor and CEO of Got Your Back Total Health in Washington, who has incorporated crawling into his practice.\"It's like resetting the central loop in the nervous system to bring all of the parts involved in coordination, movement and reflexive stability into synchronization,\" Klein said.\"You have to really work to be able to breathe, keep your head up and crawl at the same time, all while keeping your pattern,\" he said. \"That's the kind of thing where, if you are being really mindful within your crawl, it is harder than it looks.\" Klein always recommends crawling as exercise to his patients, he said, from professional athletes to those injured in car accidents.Denard Span, a center fielder for the San Francisco Giants, has included crawling in his strength and conditioning training, Klein said. When Span was with the Washington Nationals, he was Klein's patient and learned how crawling translates directly with movements used in baseball, such as a certain cross-crawl pattern seen in throwing and batting.To spread the word, Klein hosted a Crawl on the Mall event this month in which participants crawled the National Mall.But as Klein, Johnson and other enthusiasts insist that the crawling movement will help your body regain the strength, mobility and stability you had in your youth, other experts remain skeptical.Questioning the crawlMore research is needed to scientifically support the argument that crawling \"resets\" your central nervous system, at least within the physician community, said Dr. Scott Simpson, a faculty member at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine, who specializes in sports medicine at Stony Brook Orthopaedic Associates.\"To me, the benefit is that it's an efficient exercise,\" Simpson said of crawling, adding that he hadn't heard of the exercise before now.\"Based on the position you are in when you're crawling, you have to contract your abdominal muscles, and you also have to use your back muscles and your other core muscles to maintain that position and propel yourself,\" he said. \"My one word of caution would be for anyone with knee pain. Crawling on your hands and knees is rough on the knees, but there are some types of crawling exercises where you are up on your feet rather than your knees, which would be safer for the knees.\"Crawling also should be avoided if you have wrist, shoulder or neck issues, said Jacque Crockford, an exercise physiologist at the American Council on Exercise. She added that crawling on all fours, with the knees off the floor, further activates the core muscles and the body's ability to balance.Learning how to crawlTo crawl on all fours, with your knees off the floor, experts recommend to follow these three simple steps:When on your hands and knees, place your wrists under shoulders and knees under hipsNext, keep your back flat and straight, as you lift your knees about 2 inches off of the groundFinally, start crawling by moving your opposite hand and foot just 2-3 inches forward all while keeping your knees off of the ground and your back level -- repeat with your other hand and foot \"Crawling, we've all done it, but just like when babies and toddlers squat with perfect form, over time, our adult bodies begin to resist these primal and very effective movement patterns,\" Crockford said.\"As the fitness industry evolves, we are seeing more and more trainers, coaches and teams go back to these primal roots by implementing movement patterns like crawling, bending, lunging, rotating into their programming,\" she said. \"Crawling can be helpful to those seeking to challenge their body in a way they may have not tried since before they could walk, literally.\"As Johnson, the physical therapist at the Mayo Clinic, put it, \"Crawling and other natural movement patterns are not a fad or fitness craze but a return to the fundamentals of movement.\"Yet, will crawling catch on in popularity among gym-goers? Experts aren't so sure -- but if it does, don't be surprised if its name changes.What's old becomes new againThough crawling might seem new, Shape magazine fitness director Jaclyn Emerick said she has seen exercise enthusiasts crawling before -- but it was called something else.In 2012, Equinox fitness clubs offered a class called Animal Flow, in which participants crawled around the gym animal-style, she said.\"Fitness can be like something in fashion where it was trendy or in style at one point, and then it goes away for a while, and then it comes back,\" Emerick said.\"Crawling is super accessible; it's body weight. To a lot of people, it feels new, so anything that feels new is exciting, and they're more willing to try it, and it's not something that requires you to do for a very long amount of time. You can maybe do some intervals with it,\" she said. \"Crawling doesn't have to eliminate other good things that exist -- you're seeing people compare this, like 'it's the better plank' -- there's room for lots of good things. It's just another cool move, another cool exercise to add to your arsenal.\"Certain exercise movements that require you to focus on your balance can improve your working memory, according to a small study published last year in the journal Perceptual and Motor Skills.Balance may help your brawn and brainThe study involved 65 adults between the ages of 18 and 59 who were separated into three groups. One group required the participants to complete various dynamic exercises -- such as crawling and climbing trees -- for two hours. The exercises also required participants to balance and be aware of their movements and the positioning of their bodies, which is called being proprioceptively aware.\"If you think of crawling or balancing, you have to plan where you're putting your feet. You have to plan where you're putting your hands so you don't lose your balance. It's this idea of us being aware, proprioceptively aware, but also being dynamic in that awareness. We have dynamic movement involved,\" said Tracy Packiam Alloway, a psychologist at the University of North Florida who conducted the study with her husband, Ross Alloway. Another group in the study participated in a yoga class, and the third group sat in a two-hour classroom-style lecture in which they learned new information. Before and after the groups participated in these tasks, they completed a working memory test.After comparing the test scores, the researchers discovered that the adults in the exercise group had improved working memory scores compared with those in the classroom and yoga groups.\"It was only that combination of being proprioceptively dynamic that led to that improvement in working memory,\" Alloway said. \"What we found was that it was only this kind of physically moving, this movement activity, that was improving working memory up to 50%. We were actually very surprised about it.\"Overall, any such dynamic movement that you can do at home is beneficial for your health, said Simpson, the physician at Stony Brook.\"I'm a big fan of anything that gets people exercising more, and easy-to-do exercises that you can do at home without specialized equipment certainly tend to do that more than other types of exercise,\" he said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/health/crawling-exercise-fitness/index.html"}
{"_id":"Critical Counties: How Trump seized the map and Clinton lost it","articleText":"Throughout the fall, we ran a series called Critical Counties, exploring 11 counties around the country that chief national correspondent John King identified as key in the 2016 election. Here's a look back.Washington (CNN)Donald Trump overcame long odds to win the election in part because of Hillary Clinton's failure to seize the structural advantages she had entering the general election.Trump managed to walk away with Ohio and even took Pennsylvania, a state no Republican presidential nominee had won in decades. And the margins were close in some places like Michigan, a state most thought was comfortably in the blue column. The stunning result was the culmination of a lot of factors but, simply put, Trump outperformed his polls in some key areas while Clinton failed to turn her map into a reality.Over the course of the 2016 campaign, CNN analyzed a series of counties that could help explain the election. From these critical counties in Michigan, Colorado, Pennsylvania and other states, we see how Trump's win came together. We also see where Clinton lived up to expectations and where she fell short.So as the dust continues to settle around the Republican upset, here's how Trump and Clinton fared in 11 counties that helped decide the election. Data from Google Trends from the week following Election Day offers a glimpse at what residents of these counties searched following Trump's victory.Genesee County, MichiganClinton won the home county of Flint, Michigan, but as with many places in this state, she severely underperformed compared to President Barack Obama in 2012. Her failure to turn out the vote heavily in this safely Democratic area left her vulnerable to Trump's unexpected performance elsewhere.PollsTop searchesAllegheny County, PennsylvaniaClinton and Trump performed about as well in this Pittsburgh-led blue spot in Pennsylvania on election night as one might have expected. However, the story in Pennsylvania is less about the critical counties but the renewed energy in the state's rural areas. Trump's strength in rural Pennsylvania ultimately helped him carry the state.PollsTop searchesVigo County, IndianaVigo County, the ultimate bellwether county, retains its bellwether status.All the way back to 1956, Vigo County has voted for the candidate that went on to win the election. 2016 was no exception.PollTop searchesTrending searchesWake County, North CarolinaWake County, a sign of a changing North Carolina with its increasingly educated and new residents, swung even harder for Democrats than it had the past few cycles. However, it wasn't enough to bring Clinton a southern victory.PollTop searchesTrending searchesStark County, OhioWe said Stark County was a swing county in a swing state -- and a sign of Trump's potential strength there. It very much was, pulling sharply for the now President-elect.Trump's margin of victory in Ohio ended up being relatively wide, especially considering the state backed Obama in 2008 and 2012.PollTop searchesTrending searchesCuyahoga County, OhioDespite a last-minute star-studded concert in Cleveland, Clinton did not manage to come close to a win in Ohio. However, she did manage to do about as well as Obama in Cuyahoga County's vote breakdown.PollTop searchesTrending searchesPrince William County, VirginiaOne of the few predictions the polls bore out clearly was the DC area never swinging for Trump. Prince William County was rigidly blue and stopped Trump from notching another swing-state upset.PollTop searchesTrending searchesJefferson County, ColoradoThis suburb of Detroit, like much of Colorado, went for Clinton about as strongly as it did for Obama. Despite the help from the Coors family, Trump didn't manage to outperform expectations there.PollTop searchesTrending searchesEl Paso, ColoradoColorado was one of the few battlegrounds that went about how polls expected. El Paso County, a GOP stronghold in this increasingly Democratic state, went out for Trump -- but it was still not enough for a Rocky Mountain surprise.PollTop searchesTrending searchesMacomb County, MichiganMacomb County is the story of Michigan laid plain. Once the home of \"Reagan Democrats,\" this county helped crush the GOP's chances in Michigan the past few cycles, even against one of its own: Mitt Romney. But Macomb County's wide swing for Trump underscored his surprising Rust Belt victories. It's early to say, but Macomb County is the kind of place that demonstrates exactly how Trump pulled off his out-of-left-field strength in this region.In our preview of this county, we called it a \"moonshot\" for the Trump campaign. Well, he managed to pull it off.PollTop searchesTrending searchesBucks County, PennsylvaniaAs with Allegheny County, Clinton's strength in Pennsylvania was thought to come from the deep blue cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as well as their outlying suburbs. Although Clinton did almost as well as Obama in this purple zone, Trump clearly brought Pennsylvania's rural areas out to vote in a way Republicans hadn't for years.PollTop searchesTrending searches","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/politics/critical-counties-election-results/index.html"}
{"_id":"Crowds flood streets of Miami's Little Havana to cheer Castro's death ","articleText":"Miami (CNN)News of Fidel Castro's death was quick to reach Miami, the center of the Cuban exile community, where an outpouring of emotion brought jubilant crowds onto the streets of Little Havana.Some popped champagne corks, others clanged pots and waved the Cuban flag as they cheered the death of a man who defined the lives of so many Cubans through decades in exile in the United States.Hundreds gathered outside the neighborhood's Versailles restaurant, a longtime haunt of the exile community, spilling out on to the street from the sidewalk as they chanted, sang, danced and took smartphone videos of a historic moment.Others shouted \"libertad\" or \"freedom,\" an expression of hope for their compatriots in Cuba.The party was still going strong at 4 a.m. local time, more than five hours after the news of Castro's death was first announced on Cuban TV.Passing motorists added to the cacophony, honking their horns and flashing their headlights in a show of support as they drove down Calle Ocho in the heart of Little Havana.Fidel Castro, Cuba's longtime revolutionary'Everybody here hopes for a free Cuba soon'\"This is a celebration but in a way, not a celebration of a death but it's a celebration hopefully of a beginning of liberty that we are all waiting for, for many years,\" one reveler born in Cuba told CNN.\"The hope is that not just because Fidel died, but also hopefully it opens up the people in Cuba a little bit more to go against what's happening there.\"Many families have suffered decades of separation, he said, with those who left unable to return.Another Cuban-American, born in Miami, told CNN he saw this as a \"great moment, not to celebrate the death of somebody but to celebrate freedom,\" particularly for the many political prisoners still held in Cuba.\"I would love to go to Cuba, a free Cuba. Right now Cuba is not free. And so the hope is -- and I think the celebrations here show -- everybody here hopes for a free Cuba soon and for human rights on the island to come to pass.\"As Saturday morning wore on, Little Havana still buzzed with excitement over the news, with cars honking and music blaring, CNN's Chris Moody tweeted from Miami.Some Cuban exiles have waited years to mark this moment, with many false alarms along the way.Miami-Dade County's mayor, Carlos A. Gimenez, said Castro's death \"closes a very painful chapter\" for Cubans and Cuban-Americans \"affected by his cruel and brutal dictatorship.\" He said he hoped a \"free and democratic Cuba\" would emerge but cautioned that Fidel's younger brother, President Raul Castro, remained in charge of \"one of the world's most repressive governments.\"Gimenez urged those who chose to demonstrate to do so peacefully. Painful decades of exileThose out on the streets included Cuban-Americans of all ages, including some who first came from Cuba in 1959 after Castro's revolutionaries ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista.Others left in the following decades, many joining their fellow exiles in Miami and elsewhere in the United States.More than 260,000 Cubans left in a US-organized airlift between 1965 and 1973.  In 1980, Castro let another 125,000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. Among them were criminals released from Cuban jails who brought a violent crime wave to Florida. At other times, desperate Cubans fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun.Few who left back in 1959 would have believed Fidel Castro would hang on to power for so long, only ceding the presidency to his brother Raul in recent years.Fidel Castro lived long enough to see a historic thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States. The two nations re-established diplomatic relations in July 2015, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year.That thaw was welcomed particularly by younger Cuban-Americans but was more problematic for many of the older generation, who have supported strict US sanctions for decades as a means to pressure the repressive Cuban government.CNN en Español's Jose Manuel Rodríguez reported from Miami, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/us/miami-fidel-castro-death-reaction/index.html"}

He is the author of the work '120 great Nigerians we never knew', 'The Lagos-Hamburg line.' (CNN)Thousands of colorfully dressed people marched through the ancient streets of the proud city of Benin. Streets that had for almost a millennium been trodden by illustrious ancestors and unwelcome intruders alike. Warriors clad in black, royalty, chiefs and noblemen, clad in red and white, and ordinary citizens, in all colors, joined a teeming, powerful procession. At the front of the throng was the man previously referred to as Prince Eheneden Erediauwa, the Edaiken n'Uselu. At either side of him stood two chiefs, who gently led him along by his arms to the sacred site of his coronation, across the Omi River.Tradition, 700 years oldFor the people of Benin this ceremony is of the utmost importance, as they see the king or \"oba,\" as next only to the creator. Kingship as an institution is much more than a ceremony hence the kingdom's strict and largely uncompromising adherence to ancient customs and traditions.This is symbolized by the fact that many of these ancient ceremonies have been passed down from generation to generations of kings for almost 700 years. Although there have been minor changes the coronation of Prince Ehenden Erediauwa could have taken place 500 years ago.The prince's journey to the throne started several months earlier, when he started 'emwin n'ekhua'- the traditional process of ascension after hearing of his father's passing, but the final phase began twelve days prior at the prince's palace.Performing sacred ritesDuring a series of both ceremonies spanning twelve days, ancient sacred rites were performed as the prince journeyed across the kingdom, mostly on foot. One of the most important stops on this journey was to Use village, where one of the most important ceremonies took place-- the choosing of the name or title of the new king. After this, the coronation ceremony was performed by the High Chief Oliha, the head of the Benin chiefs.The final part of the journey led the prince to the ancient town of Isekhere, the procession crossed the Omi River Bridge, sacred rituals were performed and the prince made the short journey to the final station at the the Urho-okpota Hall. It was here that Oba Ewuare II, ascended to the throne of Benin.As is customary with coronations there was a glittering array of dignitaries ranging from the Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, to traditional rulers such as the Ooni of Ife, but  for the thousands of fiercely loyal and proud citizens of the ancient city, there was only one focus- their newly crowned king.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/africa/oba-of-benin-coronation/index.html"}

Ted Cruz warned President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican leaders they may face a popular revolt if they don't carry through on some of their biggest campaign promises, including repealing Obamacare.\"If we're given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don't deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets,\" Cruz said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And I think quite rightly. I think people are so fed up with Washington, this election was a mandate with change and the most catastrophic thing Republicans could do is go back to business as usual.\"Cruz was responding to a question about some Trump's flips on campaign promises, just weeks after winning the election, including saying he would not pursue a prosecution of Hillary Clinton and that he would like to keep pieces of Obamacare. Republican leaders in Congress have promised to help Trump push through top priorities, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has cautioned against Republicans going too far, lest they face a backlash at the ballot box. Democrats, who similarly swept into power in 2008, were sharply rebuked by voters in 2010.Cruz, who was an ardent opponent of Trump until the final months of the campaign, was asked about his charges that Trump was a \"pathological liar\" and \"utterly amoral.\" \"You know, I'm not going to relitigate the past.

{"_id":"Cuba's underground window into American baseball","articleText":"Havana, Cuba (CNN)On a sun-beaten suburban ballpark in Havana, young Little Leaguers line up to bat in front of a chain-link backstop missing its chain-links. Home plate is a beat-up piece of plywood and no two players wear matching shirts, let alone uniforms.The lack of resources doesn't mean lack of ambition. Some dream of playing Major League Baseball -- following in the footsteps of Cuban defectors like Orlando Hernandez or Yasiel Puig.But in a country where television is state-run, and Internet is expensive and slow, actually watching those Cuban stars in the Major Leagues is tough.On Cuban TV, it's still rare to see a Cuban player in the weekly MLB broadcast, but in the past year it has happened a few times. Before then, Cuban players would literally be edited out of the games before they went to air. Short supply has created high demand for MLB coverage -- especially games involving Cuban players.Enter \"el paquete,\" -- bought, sold and traded in Cuba's underground market for American media. Paquete is the word Cubans use to describe the USB sticks, hard drives, DVDs or sometimes even VHS tapes loaded up with American TV shows, movies and baseball games and sent to the island nation.Cubans will pay a few convertible pesos (on par with the US dollar) to get what's on the latest paquete. Those baseball games, movies and TV shows are sometimes copied and re-sold several times. Often, by the time they trickle down to the masses, they're out of date.\"They don't care [that the games are old], they just want to see the stars,\" said baseball writer Ray Otero who runs the website BaseballdeCuba.com.Otero says the influx of American media isn't something the Cuban government likes, but there isn't much it can do about it.Jorge Ramirez, a Cuban taxi driver who lives in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba buys a new paquete every week. \"You can see things on [American] TV that you can't see here,\" he said.He's never been to the United States, but thanks to the paquete, he watches American baseball -- proudly keeping track of the Cuban stars. \"I feel good because they have progressed. I can see how they have progressed,\" he said. Cuba, does have its own baseball league. Tickets cost just 3 National Pesos (about 12 cents US), and some players freely mingle with fans after the game, before heading home on their bicycles. \"The line between the players and the fans is so thin,\" said Peter Bjarkman, an American baseball historian and author who has written extensively about Cuban baseball.The problem is that the Cuban league only pays players about $125 per month -- so it's not surprising that so many are leaving. Their departure is partially what's fueling the \"paquete\" trade -- a chance for Cubans to watch homegrown talent succeeding on the highest level.As beloved as the underground tape-swap is on the island, most fans would trade it in an instant for the opportunity to simply turn on their TV and watch their national heroes live -- or better yet, see them in person. If glacial deep freeze between the US and Cuba continues to thaw out, that might not be so far off.

He refuses to sip from anything else even after it resulted in more than one trip to the hospital due to dehydration. So when Ben's father Marc Carter found the crucial sippy cup was wearing out, he launched a global plea.  \"These cups are not made anymore, the replacements are all new and fancy, we've tried them, Ben throws them at us,\" Carter said in a tweet, shared thousands of times.\"Maybe you have one stuck at the back of a cupboard?\" he asked. Such was his son's reliance on drinking from the cup that he'd twice been admitted to hospital with severe dehydration when without it, Carter said.\"In all honesty we're really worried what will happen if it falls apart completely,\" said the concerned father from Devon, in the south west of England. Global reactionPeople around the world responded, offering blue sippy cups that looked similar. But unless it was \"99.9% identical,\" Ben would refuse to drink from it explained Carter.The plea caught the attention of the cup's manufacturer Tommee Tippee. The company said its staff in the US, Australia, France and Hong Kong searched for the cup. It eventually found the original mold design and has offered to produce 500 cups for the teenager.\"Our factory team discovered that the tools to make the original cups were still stored away and, crucially, they were in a usable condition,\" said the company in a statement on its website. \"We are delighted to confirm that we are able to start production on a run of the original cup, ensuring that Ben has a lifetime supply and that his family won't ever have to worry about finding another cup,\" it added.\"You've been incredible,\" said Carter in a video message to all the people who had helped his search.\"We have more cups than we could have dreamt of.\" Read more: Autism study shows benefits when parents get involved","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/health/tommee-tippee-sippy-cup-autistic-boy-trnd/index.html"}
{"_id":"Dakota Access Pipeline could be rerouted ","articleText":"Near Cannon Ball, North Dakota (CNN)Celebrations, tears of joy, chanting and drumming rang out among thousands of protesters after the US Army announced it will not -- for now -- allow developers to build a portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe here.The Army will not let the pipeline cross the federally administered reservoir on the Missouri River \"based on the current record,\" because the decision requires more analysis, including a deeper consideration of alternative routes, Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy wrote in a letter Sunday.\"A more robust analysis of alternatives can be done and should be done ... before an easement is granted for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River on Corps land,\" Darcy wrote.The news has been cheered by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members and their supporters who argue that the pipeline, if it were to rupture at the lake, would endanger the tribe's water supply. The tribe's reservation lies a half-mile south of the proposed crossing location.But tribal leaders warn their fight isn't over, as the Army's statement does not rule out approval for the current plan in the future. \"We are asking our supporters to keep up the pressure, because while President Obama has granted us a victory today, that victory isn't guaranteed in the next administration,\" said Dallas Goldtooth, lead organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network.The pipeline's builders, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners, said late Sunday that they still would press for the project's completion \"without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe.\"The companies alleged the Army's move was an attempt to delay a decision on the crossing \"until President Obama is out of office.\" The companies received permission from the Corps to cross the lake in July, but they need a second form of permission -- the easement from the Army under the Mineral Leasing Act.\"The White House's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency,\" the developers said in a news release.Protesters 'ready to keep going'The $3.7 billion pipeline project would move about 470,000 barrels of crude oil daily from two North Dakota oil fields to an existing crude oil market near Patoka, Illinois. The pipeline would stretch across 1,172 miles through four states. The North Dakota oil fields are said to contain an estimated 7.4 billion barrels of undiscovered oil.The Army's decision comes after protesters spent months camping out in the area. The tribe, besides voicing concerns about water, also has said the construction would cut through sacred land and destroy burial sites.The protests were largely peaceful but sometimes devolved into chaos, as law officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas and sprayed water at some activists they say were unruly. Authorities say some protesters set fires, vandalized construction equipment and threw objects at officers.North Dakota's governor had ordered protesters to leave their campsite by Monday, citing harsh weather conditions. The Army Corps of Engineers had warned that activists could be arrested if they hadn't left by Monday, but the agency later said it had no plans to forcibly remove those who stay.Military veterans arriving to support Dakota pipeline protestersInstead of backing away, the protesters have recently come out in full force, even inviting US military veterans to join their already robust presence. \"I'm really happy that I'm here to witness it and celebrate with a lot of my elders and the youth, but I think that we also need to keep in mind that we need to be ready to keep going,\" protester Morning Star Angeline Chippewa-Freeland said.  Army: Look for alternative routesThe tribe sued the Army in an attempt to stop the crossing after the Army Corps of Engineers granted permits in July. Darcy's decision Sunday comes three weeks after her office announced it was delaying a decision about whether to grant the easement amid protests from the tribe and its supporters.Since that time, she wrote, representatives of the Army, the pipeline backers and tribal officials discussed additional measures that \"could further reduce the risk of a spill or pipeline rupture,\" including pipeline safety enhancements.These proposals, as well as alternative routes and a deeper examination of the risk of a spill, need to be discussed further, Darcy said.She called for the drafting of an official environmental impact statement, a months-long process that would require further study and allow the public to weigh in. She did not announce a timetable or propose alternate routes for the pipeline.Her letter noted that one previously proposed alternative -- having the pipeline cross the Missouri River about 10 miles north of Bismarck, which itself is well north of Lake Oahe -- was eliminated early in the planning phase.Pipeline supporters speak outEnergy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners said Sunday night that they believe the Army's decision was a politically motivated move triggered by the White House.Since the studying proposed by Darcy would take months, it remains to be seen how Obama's departure from the presidency on January 20 will affect events.Jason Miller, spokesman for the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump, said Monday that the pipeline is generally \"something that we support construction of.\" The Trump administration will review the matter after the inauguration, Miller said.House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted his criticism of the Army's announcement, calling the intervention \"big-government decision-making at its worst.\"\"I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us,\" Ryan tweeted.North Dakota's sole member in the House of Representatives, Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, slammed Obama.\"It was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road,\" Cramer wrote in a statement. \"Today's unfortunate decision sends a very chilling signal to others who want to build infrastructure in this country.\"Opponents ready for next fightThe Army's decision may be useful in a court challenge, according to Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice staff attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.\"If the incoming administration tries to undo this and jam the pipeline through despite the need for an analysis of alternatives, we will certainly be prepared to challenge that in court,\" he said.  \"It's not so simple for one government administration to simply reverse the decisions of the former one.\" May Boeve, the executive director leading environmental action group 350.org, celebrated the decision but also sounded a warning against any future plans to reverse it.\"The fight against Dakota Access has fired up a resistance movement that is ready to take on any fossil fuel project the Trump administration tries to approve,\" she said. \"On Dakota Access and every other pipeline: If he tries to build it, we will come.\"CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Cannon Ball, North Dakota; Jason Hanna and Max Blau reported and wrote from Atlanta.

{"_id":"Dakota Access Pipeline: Protester nearly loses arm after explosion","articleText":" (CNN)Protesters have tried to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline since late last summer. They've voiced environmental concerns. They've performed sacred rituals. They've stood in solidarity with a Native American group seeking to be heard.On Sunday night, 400 protesters clashed with police, leading to the hospitalization of more than two dozen.One protester, a 21-year-old New York resident named Sophia Wilansky, nearly lost her arm after an explosion. How did it happen? Both sides have blamed each since the weekend clashes. Billion-dollar brouhahaThe proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which is set to cost $3.7 billion, would start in North Dakota, stretch across parts of South Dakota and Iowa and end in southern Illinois. If completed, the pipeline would allow crude oil to be transported to oil refineries along the Eastern Seaboard.Wilansky was among the protesters Sunday who rallied in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Members of the tribe, whose reservation is near the project's path, believe the pipeline would affect its supply of drinking water and place downstream communities at risk of contamination from potential oil spills. The US Army Corps of Engineers granted the project final permits in July -- to the dismay of environmentalists and tribe members.Michael Knudsen, medical logistics coordinator for the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, told CNN that demonstrators on Sunday had attempted to pull a truck off of the Backwater Bridge to clear a roadblock that \"prevented people from being evacuated in an emergency.\"Knudsen said he saw police unleash water cannons on protesters even though temperatures were below freezing. They also shot rubber bullets and tear gas toward the crowd. \"It was horrific,\" one protester told CNN. \"It was a horrific scene.\"Frightening explosion, fears of amputationAs the protest stretched into Monday morning, police started to fire concussion grenades at protesters, Knudsen said.Wilansky had been handing out bottles of water to protesters when a grenade landed near her forearm. Suddenly, it detonated, according to witnesses.\"She was air lifted to County Medical Center in Minneapolis were she's currently undergoing extensive, hours-long surgery from injuries sustained from the blast,\" said a GoFundMe page raising money for her medical costs.Initially, protesters feared the worst: Doctors would have to amputate her arm due to the explosion.But Wayne Wilansky, Sophia's father, told CNN affiliate KFYR that amputation wouldn't be necessary even though the explosion \"blew the bone out of her arm.\"Wilansky noted his daughter, who might need as many as 20 surgeries to repair her forearm, still remained focused on the pipeline fight. \"Even though she's lying there with her arm pretty much blown off, she's focused on the fact that it's not about her, it's about what we're doing to our country, what we're doing to our native peoples, what we're doing to our environment,\" Wayne Wilansky said.Police: We didn't fire grenades at protestersOn Tuesday, North Dakota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Tom Iverson told CNN affiliate KFYR that state troopers had not deployed a grenade or any other explosive against protesters on Sunday.\"There is no merit to that,\" Iverson said.\"But I assure the citizens of North Dakota ... that law enforcement is investigating this. All the facts will be out there.\"The North Dakota Joint Information Center also released photos of improvised weapons that law enforcement said protesters used against them during the confrontation at Backwater Bridge. Authorities said they recovered a punctured propane cylinder, rocks and glass jars, which they said are commonly used to make Molotov cocktails.According to KFYR, police say protesters were seen running to the area where the explosion had happened. The group pulled a female from under a burned vehicle on the bridge, then fled, authorities said.'There are many witnesses'However, Wayne Wilansky questioned Iverson's contention that police refrained from using grenades.\"There are many witnesses,\" Wilansky said. \"They have scrap metal, and the sheriff's office says they did it to themselves -- that they blew up their own bombs or something. That's ridiculous.\"Despite the gruesome injury to Sophia Wilansky, protesters vowed to move ahead with further protests.As for the pipeline, construction has stalled as the Corps of Engineers engages in talks with Native American leaders.CNN's Dani Stewart contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/us/north-dakota-pipeline-conflict/index.html"}
{"_id":"Dakota Pipeline: Army Corps orders protesters out","articleText":" (CNN)A new confrontation is brewing over the Dakota Access Pipeline.Protesters fighting pipeline construction must vacate property near the Cannonball River in North Dakota -- the location of a large campsite for demonstrators -- by December 5 or face arrest, the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday.\"This decision is necessary to protect the general public from the violent confrontation between protestors and law enforcement officials that have occurred in this area, and to prevent death, illness, or serious injury to inhabitants of encampments due to the harsh North Dakota winter conditions,\" Col. John Henderson of the Corps said in a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe leader.Tribal Chairman Cave Archambault II issued a statement blasting the Corps, but didn't say exactly how the tribe would respond.\"Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever,\" he said. \"The best way to protect people during the winter, and reduce the risk of conflict between water protectors and militarized police, is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing, and deny it now.\"The order comes five days after a violent protest flared as protesters tried to cross the Backwater Bridge and go north on Highway 1806, authorities said. The Morton County Sheriff's Office said protesters set fires while officers tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas, rubber bullets and water sprayed from hoses attached to fire engines. Temperatures were below freezing that night.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/us/dakota-pipeline-access-army-corps/index.html"}

{"_id":"David Petraeus shared classified info. Now can he be secretary of state?","articleText":"Washington  (CNN)David Petraeus on Monday became the latest secretary of state candidate to interview with Donald Trump.He's a decorated military leader lauded by Democrats and Republicans alike for revolutionizing the military's approach to fighting terrorism and insurgencies, and credited with turning the tide in Iraq. Crucially, he could also allow for a compromise amid reports of divisions within the Trump team, with some backing Mitt Romney and others supporting Rudy Giuliani.Trump tweeted about the meeting immediately afterwards, saying he \"was very impressed\" with the retired general.Petraeus also briefly addressed the meeting, telling reporters it was a \"very good conversation,\" and added that, \"We'll see where it goes from here.\"But Petraeus could still face a difficult path to the top diplomatic post.For one thing, he would potentially be the third general to hold a Trump Cabinet position, a pile up of former military officers in civilian roles that the new White House could well want to avoid.For another, there's the matter of his misdemeanor for sharing classified information. It's a record that raises questions about his ability to get a security clearance and to be confirmed -- particularly as the GOP painted Hillary Clinton as unfit for the presidency for her own handling of classified material.Petraeus' past a problem?Petraeus resigned as CIA direct in November 2012, was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2015, and is currently on probation for sharing classified information with his biographer and mistress, former Army intelligence officer Paula Broadwell.Petraeus agreed to a plea deal that saw him sentenced to two years' probation and forced him to pay a $100,000 fine for sharing classified information.According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to Broadwell.Prosecutors agreed not to send Petraeus to jail because the classified information was never released to the public or published in the biography that Broadwell wrote.However, during the campaign Trump largely dismissed Petraeus' issues, saying they were significantly less grave than those of his former rival Hillary Clinton.Echos of Clinton criticismThe director of the FBI, James Comey, said Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified material and her use of a personal email server for official business while she was secretary of state.Trump said during the campaign that the FBI erred in not prosecuting Clinton, and at the second presidential debate he pledged to set up a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton if elected. Trump has since downplayed that prospect.\"The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair!,\" Trump tweeted in July.Because he admitted to a misdemeanor and not a more serious felony charge, his conviction does not necessarily prevent him from receiving a security clearance.His being on probation similarly does not bar him from receiving security clearance, according to experts, though they note that it is unusual as investigators typically prefer to wait until such a legal supervisory period is over before granting clearance.A president's prerogativeAnd in any case, experts point out, the President has broad authority to grant security clearances -- even to those with legal challenges.\"Ultimately the President has the final say,\" Sean Bigley, a security clearance lawyer and former government background investigator told CNN.He noted that the Supreme Court determined in 1988 that the final authority to bestow security clearances lies with the President.\"This court has recognized the government's 'compelling interest' in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons in the course of executive business ... The authority to protect such information falls on the President as head of the executive branch and as commander in chief,\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in the court's decision.But while Trump has the legal authority to grant a clearance, it remains to be seen if he will be willing to do so.\"I think Trump will have to make a strategic decision whether the optics of the appointment would be something he is willing to accept,\" Bigley added.General continues to be sought outPetraeus, though, has already received an endorsement of sorts from the Obama administration and Congress.Petraeus' advice and counsel continue to have been sought by both Capitol Hill and the White House.\"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in March of 2015, right around the time of Petraeus' court appearance.\"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to,  on occasion, consult for him advice,\" Earnest added, saying that he was not aware of any special precautions taken amid Petraeus' legal issues.RELATED: Source: Trump 'irritated' by Conway attacks on RomneyPetraeus also testified on Capitol Hill, appearing before the Senate Armed Services committee in 2015 to discuss the fight against ISIS.\"Gen. Petraeus, we are very interested in your views,\" Ranking Democrat Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said at the hearing.A graduate of West Point, Petraeus holds a PhD from Princeton University and is currently serving as the chairman of the Global Institute at the New York-based private equity firm KKR.Having commanded the international NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan and overseen US military forces in the Middle East, experts note Petraeus has had ample exposure to key relationships with US allies and critical countries in the region.One former colleague of his described him as a \"diplomat in uniform,\" noting that Petraeus would be more interested in the secretary of state role as opposed to running the Pentagon.CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/petraeus-secretary-of-state-trump/index.html"}

{"_id":"Deaf-blind twins share special relationship","articleText":" (CNN)Deutsches Taubblindenwerk Fischbeck is a quiet place, a German facility where more than 100 deaf-blind people live together. Before photographer Marlena Waldthausen even lifted her camera there, she spent a few days observing the residents, trying to find a way to tell their stories without knowing how to talk to them.Deaf-blindness can be isolating. For many people in Fischbeck, communication is difficult. Most of the deaf-blind people there have \"little or no 'real' relationships,\" Waldthausen said, and she was afraid that she couldn't say what she wanted to tell them.Spending time with residents, she wondered, what would be left of her own life is she could neither see nor hear?But on the second day of her visit, she crossed paths with a set of twin brothers. Rolf was guiding Jörg, she remembers, and they were laughing and joking. \"I just really liked them from the first moment I saw them,\" said Waldthausen, who is based in Berlin. \"What I found so special about them was their almost symbiotic relationship, this 'blind' understanding.\"Jörg and Rolf Fischer were born deaf, and Jörg lost his eyesight due to diabetes. Rolf, who also has diabetes, can still see a little out of one eye. At 49, they live together in Fischbeck and travel home on weekends to spend time with their parents. They love their routine, Waldthausen said, and handle many parts of their lives independently -- dressing, making their beds and having meals on their own. Caretakers accompany them to activities like swimming or horseback riding. In the afternoons and evenings, they might drink coffee, play with dogs, rest or watch TV -- Rolf will get close so he can watch, then report back to Jörg.They communicate through tactile sign language; they take each other's hands and form signs with the hands and arms of the other. Although they struggle with sensation in their hands because of diabetes, they also use the Lorm alphabet, where every letter corresponds with a point on the palm. A series of strokes and taps can share a thought.Their sign language is their own, though. Even their caretakers can't follow conversations between them, Waldthausen said. They might make loving gestures, or seem to hit each other, or pull their arms and fingers.And they are funny -- \"amazing\" humor, Waldthausen said. They give each other funny hairstyles, push each other around in a wheelchair or pretend to bite each other.\"I think they might forget a little about their situation when they are fooling around,\" Waldthausen said.Waldthausen struggled at first, feeling insecure about how to communicate with them. \"I couldn't smile, gesture or apologize in the way I am used to when I have to communicate with people that speak a language I don't understand,\" she said. So Waldthausen learned the Lorm alphabet and started a course in sign language. She spent months with the twins in 2015 and 2016, staying in rooms nearby and going on vacation with the family. Now, she can joke with them or talk about their trip to the zoo, or the sausages they ate for dinner.In one of her favorite moments, the twins attended a photojournalism exhibition that featured Waldthausen's images. She and their mother explained each one. \"They were so proud when people came and shook their hands,\" she said. \"That was a really nice moment for me after spending so many months with them, being able to make them experience the outcome of the project.\"People tell her the images moved them, she said, or made them feel warmly toward the twins just by seeing them together. She knows the feeling. \"It makes me happy (that) I could show something through the pictures that I myself experienced being with them,\" she said, \"and that I could make something visible that is usually not so visible.\"Marlena Waldthausen is a German photographer based in Berlin.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/cnnphotos-deaf-blind-twins-jorg-rolf/index.html"}
{"_id":"Dear journalists: Stop taking Trump literally","articleText":"Brad Todd is a founding partner at OnMessage, Inc., an advertising agency where he has produced ads for Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Bobby Jindal, and many others. He was formerly a partner in the Todd & Castellanos Creative Group and founded Coach to Cure MD, a charity project involving America's college football coaches to raise awareness and research dollars for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The views expressed here are his own. (CNN)Just before the dawn of the Trump administration, journalism in Washington, DC, faces an existential crisis -- but virtually no one in the profession is willing to diagnose it. Here it is: For the first time, words don't matter. In August, as a guest on MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily, I noted that voters take Donald Trump seriously but not literally, while journalists take him literally, but not seriously. The rubric got traction on social media, became the headline of a widely read piece for The Atlantic by savvy columnist Salena Zito, and has been oft-repeated by other commentators, including tech pioneer and Trump backer Peter Thiel in a much-watched National Press Club address.Months later and on the far side of the election, the press is still taking Trump more literally and less seriously than voters do.  The most recent case in point is the furor over his baseless claim on Twitter about voter fraud, that \"millions of people who voted illegally\" cost him the popular vote. It's the latest instance of the media buying into Trump's outrage-tweeting strategy. And journalists keep falling for it because they, like politicians, over-value words -- and they are now covering a politician who does not. President-elect Trump still takes the same cavalier approach to verbal description as he would in hawking a condo tower that's yet to be designed. And more than enough voters don't seem to mind.Trump has spent a career interacting with journalists, but as the first president never to serve in the military, the cabinet, or another public office before his election to the White House, he's never been immersed in the word culture that drives political journalism.Journalists are conditioned to believe that words are the ultimate product, to be curated, sweated, grinded and polished. The profession slavishly follows the Associated Press Style Manual, which is hotly debated on every revision, to achieve industry-wide consensus on exactly which words are forbidden and which verbal shortcuts are allowed. Any exceptions to that manual come in the form of a style manual unique to each publication or network, a supplemental set of inviolable stone tablets.This devotion to words as product breeds a detailed process. At every newspaper in America, the beat reporter submits his or her story to a department editor, then a copy editor, then sometimes to a managing editor -- with specific words parsed and pored and debated at each stop. Many politicians have similar processes, with each speech, letter, and even tweet reviewed and wordsmithed by teams of people whose careers are dedicated to the craft of words. These teams are made up of many who came through the exact same journalism school training as the reporters who now critique their words.But real estate developer Donald Trump's training on words is entirely different -- and the press has yet to adapt to it. It seems that not a day now passes in which Washington reporters don't dig up an old statement or tweet of Trump's and discover a contradiction with a fresher statement or tweet from the President-elect. Most recently, when Trump announced he had chosen South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to be his ambassador to the United Nations, journalists raced to re-tweet a March rant from Trump in which he said the people of South Carolina should be embarrassed by her. The task for journalists covering Trump should be to get into the mindset of their readers, and out of the mindset of their own newsroom bureaucracies. Writing endless columns on this or that flip-flop based on Trump's conflicting rhetoric is wasting the time of the readers and viewers who have decided that's not what matters with this particular President-elect.The public -- also known as \"customers\" of for-profit news outlets -- sees Trump's words differently than journalists do. They, or at least the members of his winning electoral coalition, see Trump not as a politician but as a businessman. They know, and even value, the fact that his words have not passed through a gauntlet of spinners, prose smoothers, and fact-checkers. They may have met other real estate professionals in their own lives and they know better than to take the words of ad hoc marketing seriously. These supporters are not giving Trump a benefit of the doubt. They recognize his professional DNA, and journalists are overdue to recognize this discernment by their own audiences.Trump has spent a career being judged by the monetary value of his transactions and the certainty with which he can turn dirt into concrete and steel. Those are the metrics he expects to be judged by as President as well. If the economy and the federal budget are better off after his term, he'll be re-elected in spite of his words. If the dollars and the concrete in America are in worse shape, he'll lose. He won this year in spite of his words and he can succeed as President in spite of them, too -- so long as voters continue to take him seriously but not literally.Donald Trump's electoral coalition has shaken up American politics in ways few expected. Smart operatives in both parties are already trying to adapt practices and metrics to better suit the wave of change Trump rode. The Washington press corps, already suffering through a decade-long decline in viewer trust and consumption, would be foolish to not adapt as well. If the press covers Trump the way it covered prior presidents -- too literally -- it may find its own customers take journalism itself a lot less seriously.

{"_id":"Deep space: Are we smart enough to beat the physics?","articleText":"CNN Inspirations: Out of This World explores mankind's dream of living beyond planet Earth. (CNN)Imagine something so distant that with our current technology it would take 2,400 generations to reach there -- and that's just our nearest star.Even moving at 10 miles a second, like the Voyager spacecraft launched in the 1970s, it would take around 80,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri -- which is 4.2 light years away.If we want to explore anything in the wider galaxy, the challenges are enormous ... and we don't even know how to keep astronauts safe. Is there any hope of overcoming things which today seem impossible?Radiation shieldsBuilding a ship that can travel at enormous speeds is vital but there's one rather large elephant occupying the bridge of our vessel. The Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field protect us from lethal radiation from the sun. Without similar protection from the hostile space environment we are not going anywhere very far -- at least, not alive. Even the relatively short hop to Mars puts explorers at serious risk. NASA says a Mars voyager would receive a radiation dose around 100 times the average yearly exposure on Earth. Cladding for a spacecraft would have to be meters thick to give full protection, and too heavy to be viable. Lining the spacecraft with water or even the astronauts' own waste have been suggested as possible solutions. Perhaps there's another way. Scientists at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) have been working on an idea to protect space travelers, taking inspiration from the \"Star Trek\" shield. The plan is to make a mini magnetosphere -- a tiny version of the magnetic field that shields the Earth -- to protect people and spacecraft components. \"It's got to be solved,\" said Ruth Bamford, lead researcher for the deflector shield project at RAL, telling CNN that the problem was a \"potential show stopper for manned exploration.\"As a next step, Bamford would like to see the project tested in space. \"I would like us to come up with some designs for making a test on a space craft or to piggy back on someone else's.\"I would like to have a small shield on a spacecraft to discover when we switch it on or off we can see the radiation radically reduce or disappear,\" she said.  In the meantime, private companies are pressing ahead with their Mars missions. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, is aiming for a manned mission in the mid-2020s. NASA too has turned its attention to the problem, studying a shielding technique using carbon, boron, nitrogen and hydrogen in tiny tubes. \"Some of the solutions are technology we have already, like hydrogen-rich materials, but some of it will necessarily be cutting edge concepts that we haven't even thought of yet,\" space radiation engineer Jonathan Pellish says on the NASA website  Propulsion So let's assume we can find a way to keep our space explorers safe. How are we going to get them anywhere in a hurry? One form of propulsion that has been suggested is an anti-matter drive. It sounds like something from science fiction but the principle sounds simple enough. You mix matter with anti-matter, they annihilate each other and there's an enormous release of energy that could be harnessed. As RAL astronomer and space scientist Barry Kellett puts it: \"The engine is simple. The problem is getting the fuel.\" The particle accelerator at the CERN complex in Switzerland can make anti-matter but only creates extremely small amounts. With current technology it estimates that it would take about a billion years to make a gram ... and at huge cost. You can't store anti-matter in a can -- it would destroy the can -- so it would have to be captured and held in a magnetic field. Then you have to get it into space, and safely. If those seemingly impossible barriers could be crossed then RAL scientist Bob Bingham estimates that a spacecraft might be able to reach half the speed of light. \"In other words, it would take eight years to get to the nearest star which is four light years away and then another four years for a signal to get back,\" he said. The problem can be eased slightly by sending tiny robotic probes, which does away with the cost and complexity of looking after humans in space for considerable periods. \"If it costs $1billion for a robot camera why spend $100 billion to get someone to press the button for you?\" said Kellett. What other ways are there of powering a spaceship? Many have been proposed, including solar sails and photon laser thrusters.NASA is encouraging new technologies with its Innovative Advanced Concepts program.One of those studies focuses on PuFF -- pulsed fission-fusion propulsion system -- which NASA says aims to make a \"radical improvement in our ability to explore destinations across the solar system and beyond.\" TelescopesIf we can't go there ourselves, perhaps we can explore remotely from the comfort of home. The Gaia space telescope, with its billion-pixel camera, is already helping with this. The mission's aim is to build a three-dimensional picture of our galaxy, measuring precise distances to a billion stars. The European Space Agency (ESA) says Gaia has already mapped the precise position of 1,142 million stars, hinting at \"treasures to come.\" The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a successor to Hubble, is due to launch in 2018. Instead of studying visible and ultraviolet light like Hubble, the JWST will work in the infra-red spectrum, allowing scientists to detect more distant targets. Perhaps these telescopes and future missions will help to build a bigger and more detailed picture of the hundreds of exoplanets that have already been discovered by NASA's Kepler space telescope. A NASA team has been investigating the possibilities of a future telescope they've called the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) that would be able to resolve stars in galaxies more than 10 million light-years away. \"One of the killer apps currently planned for ATLAST is the ability to detect signatures of life in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets in the solar neighborhood,\" said ATLAST study scientist Mark Clampin on the NASA website. It is possible that we may one day be able to detect seasons on other worlds -- something Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides thought possible in an interview with CNN in 2013. \"I think there's a very good chance that we're alive when we actually find another 'Earth' in another solar system -- how profound is that?\"It's a confidence shared by RAL's Bob Bingham. \" I envisage that we will see the signs of life on an exoplanet very soon,\" he told CNN. Impossible ....or is it?Imagine going back in time and meeting the first Europeans who arrived in what is now the United States. How would you explain satellite TV to them?We routinely watch video on our cell phones and can travel to the other side of the planet in 24 hours. Some of these things weren't possible even a few decades ago.So what else that we consider impossible now might be feasible in years to come?Is there a way to separate space and time to allow us to reach places instantaneously? Could we warp space time to make a short cut like the characters in the \"Star Trek\" series? In 2014, CNN reported that NASA's Harold White had been working to develop a warp drive that will allow spacecraft to travel at speeds faster than light.More recently, and a century after Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves, they were finally proved to exist. Could they be harnessed in some way to allow cosmic travel? The answers to all the things -- including time travel -- might be ones we can't even imagine right now.Or perhaps the person who invents the time machine is you ... then you'll have some explaining to do.

Gabbard, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, is being considered for jobs at the Defense Department, State Department and the United Nations, a source told CNN. Gabbard stepped down from her post as a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee earlier in the year to support Sanders -- and fight Hillary Clinton -- in the primaries. She stood by Sanders through the Democratic convention, only announcing she would vote for Clinton days after the convention ended.\"President-elect Trump asked me to meet with him about our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as other foreign policy challenges we face,\" Gabbard said in a  statement. \"I felt it important to take the opportunity to meet with the President-elect now before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government -- a war which has already cost hundreds of thousands of lives and forced millions of refugees to flee their homes in search of safety for themselves and their families.She added, \"While the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump, I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives.\"Gabbard is not the first Democrat to meet with Trump. Trump met last week with corporate education reformer Michelle Rhee, the former schools chief of Washington, who is being considered for education secretary. If Trump picks Gabbard or Rhee for his administration, it would mark an about-face for the incoming president, who promised in October that Democrats would not serve in his Cabinet.Also expected to meet with Trump today at Trump Tower are former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown and Newt Gingrich.

{"_id":"Democrats hope Trump meets his match in Schumer","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The battle for America's political soul could come down to a street brawl between two boys from Queens and Brooklyn.Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer are spoiling for a clash once the President-elect takes office next year and the new Democratic Senate minority leader gets his hands on his caucus after winning election on Wednesday.Schumer had hoped to be directing a Senate majority to implement Hillary Clinton's agenda, but the stunning upset in last week's election means he is the lone hope for Democrats as they resist an unexpected Republican presidency and GOP dominance on Capitol Hill.\"Chuck Schumer is going to be the single most influential Democrat in Washington,\" said Jim Manley, a former top aide to retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. \"He is, as leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, the only thing standing between the Trump-Ryan legislative agenda and those who are opposed.\"Trump and Schumer -- both flamboyant, media savvy, outspoken, deal-making larger-than-life New York personalities have history. In fact, Schumer is one of the few political figures in Washington who Trump actually knows well, and the billionaire contributed to several of his new rival's election campaigns. Schumer even rode to Trump's defense when he got embroiled in a primary spat earlier this year with Ted Cruz over \"New York values.\" Schumer (Brooklyn) and Trump (Queens, then Manhattan), had common cause against the Texas senator.Schumer could never have expected he would be matching wits against Trump in the White House -- but the next stage of their political relationship promises to be one of the most intriguing stories of 2017.Given their common experience in the New York fishbowl, where business and politics mix, both probably have an idea of what makes the other tick. That alone contrasts with the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who lacked a common political language. McConnell would prefer to work with Vice President Joe Biden instead.Skirmishes between Trump and Schumer will also reflect the ironic influence of the elite East Coast haven of New York on top-level politics in Washington -- after an election decided in the industrial heartlands of the Rust Belt.Expect fireworksTrump, with his reality television background, promises to dominate the conversation once he moves to Washington in January.But in Schumer, Democrats also possess a megaphone, and a contrast to the soft-spoken Machiavellian Reid, who was more of an inside player.Schumer's facility with the media led to the Washington cliche that the most dangerous place in the city was between him and a camera, but in recent years he has refashioned his image and spent less time in television green rooms.He's promoted other Democrats from his spot on the party's Senate Democratic leadership team and become a more rounded political figure.\"He has become a much more serious legislator and I think Republicans understand that,\" Manley said.Still, Schumer's capacity to drive a sharp political message and sense of shifting political winds will be vital to Democrats as they climb off the canvas.Schumer the politician is known as a schmoozer, who is willing to engage the other side but to also fight tenaciously.Schumer \"has generally worked well with Republicans even though he can be a fierce partisan,\" said Jim Kessler, who was a senior aide to Schumer on Capitol Hill for eight years and now is senior vice president for policy at Third Way.\"He has a belief that politics is a rough sport but it can be played fairly and cleanly. If you play the game that way even if you take a shot at him he feels that it is fair and doesn't ruin the relationship,\" Kessler said.If it comes to a knife fight with Trump, Schumer is unlikely to shirk from a confrontation and will marshall his Democrats behind him.\"This is a guy -- he wants to win,\" said Jim Battista, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, New York, where Schumer is a fixture at commencement ceremonies.\"It's not much use being the minority leader, if ... he is not winning.\"Dealmaking possible?Still, if common ground does emerge in the new Washington, Schumer is likely to explore it.In recent years, he has built relationships with Republicans like Sen John Cornyn of Texas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. And it's likely his interactions with McConnell will not be as publicly acidic as those between Reid and the Republican leader in recent years.The Democratic leader in waiting's first task is to restore equilibrium to his traumatized party. By January, he must chart a strategy for their efforts next year to emerge as a roadblock to Trump and to salvage as much as they can of Obama's legacy by wielding the Senate filibuster.Then, Schumer must steel his party for a tough set of re-election races in the mid-terms in 2018.Fresh from his uncontested election on Wednesday, the product of years of behind-the-scenes maneuvering that speaks to Schumer's political shrewdness, the New York senator vowed to stand firm against Trump but to also seek areas where the next president and Democrats can work together.\"When we can agree on issues, then we're going to work with them,\" Schumer said. \"But I've also said to the President-elect on issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight.\"Possible common ground includes Trump's proposals for a massive infrastructure building program and a plan to censure China for what critics says is currency manipulation.But hopes for cooperation hit a reality check this week, with the appointment to a top White House job of Stephen Bannon, a Trump ally who has links to the white nationalist movement.The move alarmed some Democrats because it appeared to suggest that the Trump administration would embrace some of the darker aspects of the Republican's campaign — but it also energized a party that had spent the days since the election wallowing in grief.\"We're going to keep a really careful eye on the president and on him. If they do anything from this day forward -- they've done so much awful from this day back -- and we're going to go after them in terms of bigotry,\" Schumer said.Rebuilding the Democratic brandOne of Schumer's most important duties -- as the effective leader of his party in Washington, will be to repair Democratic links to blue collar and middle class Midwestern voters who defected to Trump.With that in mind, he expanded the Senate Democratic leadership team to include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose populist primary campaign tapped into the sense of economic malaise and anti-establishment fervor exploited by Trump. Schumer's critics have long pointed to his ties to Wall Street finance and big money donors to question his fealty to working class Democratic values.But Kessler said no one in American politics has a better understanding of the economic challenges facing voters.\"He has the best intuitive sense of the middle class of any politician I have ever met,\" said Kessler.\"He comes from the middle class, he still lives in a middle class area, and he obsesses about them and their well being. If there was ideology called middle class it would be his.\"As he reaches out to disaffected Democratic voters, Schumer might be influenced by his own dealings with economically challenged areas of his own state, where he won a thumping 70% of votes in his re-election race.\"He's a broadly seen as a Manhattan guy who is working at not appearing so much of a Manhattan guy,\" said Battista, who said Schumer had taken pains to understand the concerns of Western New York, including campaigns to keep the Buffalo Bills from relocating. \"He's somebody who has always seemed to be comfortable sitting down and talking to the Rust Beltier parts of New York.\"CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/chuck-schumer-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Democrats, the party who cried racist ","articleText":"Brett J. Talley is a lawyer, author, one-time writer for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and former speechwriter for Sen. Rob Portman. He is deputy solicitor general at the office of Alabama's attorney general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Blaming racism for a lost election is nothing new for some on the left. The tea party wave in 2010 was ascribed to racism, even as Republicans captured Senate seats in a number of states President Obama won. And President Obama's re-election in 2012 didn't stop Democrats from blaming racism for their defeat two years later. So it's no surprise that as the results came in for Donald Trump, charges of racism followed. CNN contributor Van Jones called Trump's victory a \"whitelash,\" while CNN's Fareed Zakaria argued racism was a pillar of Trump's electoral success. But although some Democrats have seldom faced a defeat they couldn't attribute to the personal failings of the voters, the 2016 election may be unique to the extent in which the left weaponized charges of racism. In 2016, in their view, racism wasn't just an amorphous problem, but an inherent flaw in the American body politic that prevented liberal politicians from marching to victory. The left alleged that the candidate himself was a racist, leveling the same charge against his advisers and campaign staff. Hillary Clinton's infamous \"basket of deplorables\" speech labeled half of Trump's supporters — more than 30 million Americans — as \"irredeemable\" racists. That Trump won states and voters that had twice gone to President Obama hasn't stopped Democrats from doubling down. As Trump has laid out his Cabinet, new charges of racism have emerged, with little evidence to support them. Steve Bannon was deemed a white nationalist and an anti-Semite based on disputed allegations made by his ex-wife during divorce proceedings and the content and comments found on Breitbart, the far-right website he was executive chairman of before working for the Trump campaign. Democrats attacked Gen. Michael Flynn, calling him a racist and an Islamophobe after taking his comments -- which stated that he believes radical Islamic terrorism is an existential threat to America -- out of context.  Similar allegations focused on crying Islamophobe have also been made against Rep. Mike Pompeo in the days after Trump's announcement that he intends to name him director of the CIA. But few have endured the kind of personal attacks Sen. Jeff Sessions has faced since Trump announced his plans to nominate him to be our nation's next attorney general. Sessions, a senator for 20 years, former Alabama attorney general, and United States attorney for the Southern District of Alabama during the Reagan administration, would seem to be the perfect nominee. But Sessions is also a vocal opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants, a position that is anathema to the progressive movement. Sessions' opponents immediately raised the specter of racism to oppose him, and the press played along. Chris Cuomo asked Kellyanne Conway on CNN's \"New Day\" whether Sessions was a racist. Others were less circumspect. Salon referred to Sessions and Trump as \"two peas in a racist pod,\" while Slate lamented that \"Jeff Sessions' racism sadly doesn't matter.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called stopping Sessions' nomination \"a moral question.\"One might expect that those leveling these charges against a distinguished US senator would have powerful evidence. But you'd be wrong. Instead, Sessions' name has been dragged through the mud on the basis of 30-year-old accusations of racism made after his 1986 nomination for a federal district judgeship. These charges consisted of largely unsubstantiated, half-remembered statements from private conversations. DOJ lawyers, including one of the witnesses whose statements were used against Sessions, testified that Sessions was not only not a racist, but had doggedly pursued civil rights cases even when they were unpopular. But it didn't matter. It was one of the first times the race card was played, and it worked. Sessions was blindsided by the allegations, and his nomination failed in committee. But even if these accusations of racism — which Sessions has long disputed — were fair game in 1986, it borders on absurd that they are the basis for opposing Sessions now. Sessions' detractors have presented not a shred of evidence from the past three decades that Sessions is a racist. Never mind that Sessions pressed for the death penalty against a Ku Klux Klan leader during his time as Alabama attorney general. Never mind that Sessions filled perhaps the most important position in his office, chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary, with an African-American lawyer who worked with him for nearly a decade. Never mind that Sessions voted to confirm Eric Holder, spearheaded an effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, and joined civil rights leaders in Selma to honor the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Either those leveling charges of racism against Sessions don't know these things or they don't care. That's the price of weaponizing racism. It transforms what should be a serious accusation made only on the basis of irrefutable evidence into little more than a tool in the left's political bag of tricks, a way to undermine their opponents with the ultimate smear. The irony is that in using race in this manner, the charge of racism has lost much of its potency. The left has played that card so long on so many people in so many instances that today it is met with little more than an eye roll. But that the attack usually fails makes it no less contemptible. They may be your political enemies, but they are people, too. One of Sessions' chief antagonists during his 1986 confirmation hearings was then-Republican Sen. Arlen Spector, whose vote helped scuttle Session's nomination. But in his later years, Spector began to regret that decision and all that it implied, calling it the one vote he had made as senator that was a mistake. \"I have since found,\" he remarked candidly, \"that Sen. Sessions is an egalitarian.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/opinions/democrats-the-party-who-cried-racist-talley/index.html"}
{"_id":"Denver on track to allow marijuana use at designated businesses","articleText":" (CNN)Getting high in Denver is about to get more social. The city is on track to approving a groundbreaking new measure that would allow people to use marijuana at designated businesses such as restaurants and bars. Although the results are not yet finalized, the tally as of Tuesday night showed 53.4% voted in favor and 46.5% opposed. Opponents of the measure conceded Tuesday, CNN affiliate KDVR reported. The Denver vote appears to mark another victory for the pot legalization movement. Colorado and Washington became the first states to approve recreational marijuana use in 2012. California, Massachusetts and Nevada also joined that club by legalizing recreational marijuana use last week.The Denver measure, called Initiative 300, would allow marijuana use in private businesses that receive a permit from the city. Business owners could set up an area inside or outside for smoking, but they must also get approval from their neighborhood organization to do so. While people in Colorado have been able to buy pot, they haven't had many options where they could use it legally. It's not allowed in public such as parks, sidewalks or near places where kids gather. \"We have millions of people visiting the state of Colorado,\" Emmett Reistroffer, who advocated for the measure, said in a Tuesday press conference. \"Many of them are trying cannabis and have nowhere to go. I also think it's important they have somewhere to go where staff is trained because we want to promote responsible use.\" Critics of the initiative had argued that the measure would expand public use of marijuana and expose bystanders to secondhand smoke.Initiative 300 is a pilot program that would expire in 2020 unless the city council passes a new law or Denver voters push another ballot initiative.

{"_id":"Despite reassurance, Obama warns Europe of a 'meaner world'","articleText":"Berlin (CNN)President Barack Obama, returning to Berlin Thursday, intended to reassure his most stalwart global ally, Chancellor Angela Merkel, about her prospects under Donald Trump.Instead, Obama found himself warning of an impending shift in the global order, one he advised could lead to a \"meaner, harsher, more troubled world\" if not stopped.\"Whoever is president and whoever is the chancellor of Germany and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world, they need to recognize that,\" Obama said. \"There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism. For looking the other way with somebody else's problems. That are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient.\"\"If we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worst world,\" he said. \"We will go backwards instead of forwards. So whoever the US president is, whoever the chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that. And our citizenry who decide who our presidents and chancellors are need to remember that.\"It was a dire prediction that barely matched the upbeat attitude Obama has attempted to put forward as he works to facilitate a peaceful transition to Trump's presidency. In his appearances in Europe, Obama has made a point of hailing the NATO alliance, insisting that Trump remains committed to upholding the group's commitment to mutual defense. And he expressed cautious optimism Thursday that Trump would moderate his tone once he assumes office.But as his final foreign swing wears on, Obama's alerts about the wave of nationalist politics spreading in the US and Europe have grown more dire. He bemoaned the way information flows in a digital age, and decried an echo-chamber of falsities masquerading as facts.\"In an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in sound bites and snippets off their phones, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,\" he said. \"If people, whether they're conservative, liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.\"He issued a warning to Trump in his dealings with Russia, cautioning that on issues like Ukraine and Syria, Moscow must be confronted head-on. \"I don't expect the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest we cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable,\" he said.And he said he advised Trump to tone down his campaign rhetoric during their Oval Office meeting last week.\"He ran an extraordinarily unconventional campaign and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history,\" Obama said. \"What I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him.\"This is Obama's final visit as President to Berlin, the city where he introduced himself to the world in 2008 but where he now faces persistent questions about the future of transatlantic ties and liberal progress.Obama spent most of his time huddling with Merkel, his closest counterpart who is now Europe's most powerful leader as the continent prepares for Trump's presidency. She expressed guarded optimism about Trump Thursday, her controlled demeanor barely reflecting an iota of worry about the man who lambasted her as a candidate. She praised Obama for facilitating a smooth transition, and said she was approaching Trump with an \"open mind.\"As her European counterparts face political challenges at home, Merkel has assumed a critical role in transatlantic ties, voicing strong support for Obama's priorities on climate change, Russian sanctions and economic reform.The personal chemistry between the leaders was on display Thursday, Obama winking as he sat for talks in Merkel's chancellery, and Merkel grinning as she anticipated a visit from Obama in his post-presidency.\"I'm game!\" she said.The German leader has not yet said whether she'll run for a fourth term next year, though her political allies have signaled she will. Like leaders in France, Britain, the US and elsewhere, she'll face challenges from far-right politicians who are running on an agenda of populist nationalism.Obama declined to push her to run Thursday, but suggested he would vote for her if he was German.Obama finds himself in Germany in a vastly different political environment than when he first spoke here as a candidate in 2008. Back then, a crowd of 200,000 gathered in the city's Tiergarten to hear a young senator extoll the necessity of multilateral ties after George W. Bush-era tensions.Europeans had grown wary of the US during Bush's presidency. They regarded Obama as an urbane, liberal counterpoint to a Republican administration that had grown derisive of Europe in the debate over the Iraq War.During his 2008 speech, Obama lauded open and diverse societies.\"The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand,\" Obama said then. \"These now are the walls we must tear down.\"Now, as Trump drafts plans to erect a wall on the US border with Mexico, those words seem from a distant past. While he remains insistent on the values of liberal, open societies, Obama has grown more realistic about the speed and scope of change.\"I think our politics everywhere are going to be going through a bumpy phase,\" Obama said.

{"_id":"Destination Mars: Probe readied for Red Planet landing","articleText":" (CNN)It has separated from mother and is now facing a baptism of fire as it heads towards the surface of the Red Planet.The Mars lander Schiaparelli is due to touch down Wednesday as part of the ExoMars missions -- a joint venture between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russian state corporation Roscosmos.Schiaparelli's companion ship -- the Trace Gas Orbiter -- will stay in orbit, trying to find out more about methane and other gases on Mars that could be signatures of life, or geological processes.In 2014, NASA's Curiosity rover detected a large spike in the amount of methane. ESA scientists hope that the ExoMars missions can shed light on what might be causing it.Schiaparelli is designed to be a test flight for another ExoMars venture -- a 2020 launch that will send a rover to Mars. But Schiaparelli will also operate for a few days, measuring wind speed, temperature, humidity, pressure and the strength of electric fields on the planet's surface. It will also collect a series of images in the final stages of descent.Engulfed by dust stormsSenior science adviser at ESA, Mark McCaughrean, told CNN that the lander was entering a world of dust storms. It is thought that dust particles bumping into each other create a static charge that lifts even more dust, creating clouds that can engulf the whole planet. It is this electric field that they want to investigate, McCaughrean explained.Getting there is a major challenge though. The spacecraft cannot be steered in real time and plunges through the thin Martian atmosphere at 1,700 kph (more than 1,000 mph), protected by its heat shield.McCaughrean said a parachute would be deployed when Schiaparelli is still moving at 250 kph (150 mph) before thrusters fire for the last 30 seconds of descent. The probe also has a crumple zone to help cushion the landing.Mission controllers will be hoping for better fortune than in 2003 when contact was lost with an ESA Mars probe called Beagle 2 during a planned landing on Christmas Day. Only last year, images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that the craft had landed successfully but its solar panels had failed to deploy properly. 'Mars is hard'Beagle's accompanying orbiter, Mars Express, continues to send back data from Mars, recently picturing what ESA says is the remnants of ancient glaciers. \"Mars is hard,\" said McCaughrean. \"Mars has a very thin atmosphere which makes it very difficult to get down to the surface... it's been a graveyard for previous missions.\"Having been through two Rosetta landings it's going to be nerve-wracking but I'm really thrilled about going back to get it right this time. We're back to prove we have the ability,\" he said.ESA has greater ambitions for the 2020 mission. The rover will be able to drill two meters into the Martian surface to look for signs that life may exist today or sometime in the past.People have long wondered whether our neighboring planet could have harbored life. The landing craft is named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli who mapped Mars in the 19th century and whose description of \"canali\" on the surface sparked a debate about whether they could have been created by Martian inhabitants. Modern observations showed that these channels never existed. The two ExoMars missions, which McCaughrean said will cost more than a billion euros ($1.10 billion), come at a time of renewed interest in the Red Planet. Writing for CNN, US President Barack Obama spoke of America's goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s \"with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\"Human mission ahead?If successful, Schiaparelli will join two active NASA rovers on the Martian surface -- Curiosity which arrived in 2012 and Opportunity which has been returning images for more than 12 years. Spirit's mission finished in 2011.Several orbiters are also learning more about our neighboring planet. NASA's MAVEN probe is investigating the Martian atmosphere along with an Indian spacecraft called MOM.MAVEN has already discovered that solar winds have stripped gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide from the planet, and found auroras on Mars that are similar to the northern lights on Earth.NASA is planning a new rover mission that will scour the surface for the signs of life. It is due to land in February 2021.President Obama said exploring Mars would \"require continued cooperation between government and private innovators\" and independent companies are already making plans.Mars One says it will start training astronauts in 2017 in preparation for a launch in the mid-2020s, and Space X has tested a rocket it plans to use for a future mission to Mars.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/health/mars-lander-schiaparelli-exomars-esa/index.html"}
{"_id":"Did police homophobia fail serial killer's gay victims? ","articleText":" (CNN)It could be the plot of a TV murder mystery -- except viewers might struggle to believe the killer could keep getting away with it. Over 15 months, Stephen Port, a 41-year-old chef from a working class east London borough drugged, raped, and killed four gay men he met on dating apps.He then dragged their bodies a few hundred meters from his flat, planting drugs and even suicide notes penned in his own handwriting to make it appear as if they had overdosed.Three of the victims were found slumped in the same churchyard -- two of those discovered by dog-walker Barbara Denham.  A fourth victim was found at the entrance to Port's block of flats. \"The serial killers which are most difficult to catch are transient -- they kill in one part of the country, then another,\" explained David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University.\"But Stephen Port was not a transient serial killer. He killed in his flat, then dumped the bodies 300 meters away. They were all young men who died the same way,\" he told CNN.\"The idea that it wasn't linked beggars belief.\"Police under investigation On Friday Port was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of fashion student Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; fellow chef Daniel Whitworth, 21; and forklift truck driver Jack Taylor, 25 -- crimes that Port denied.London's Metropolitan Police admitted there may have been \"missed opportunities to catch Port sooner\" during the spate of murders between June 2014 and September 2015. The force is now reviewing the deaths of dozens of men who also used sex-enhancing drugs, amid concerns that cases previously dismissed as drug overdoses could be further victims.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has also launched an investigation into police handling of the case.What if the victims were women?Leading gay rights activist Peter Tatchell questioned whether homophobia and class played a role in police conduct.\"If four young middle class women had been murdered in Mayfair, I believe the police would have made a public appeal much sooner and mounted a far more comprehensive investigation,\" he said, referring to a wealthy area of inner London.\"The killing of low income gay men in working class Barking was treated very differently -- police officers stand accused of class, gender and sexuality bias.\"Criminologist Wilson agreed that the case had \"a great deal to do with the persistence of homophobia generally and within the police.\" However he added that one group of female victims similarly ignored by the police were sex workers.\"It was some way down the line before the continuing disappearance of women in Ipswich started to have an impact on public consciousness,\" he said of the 2006 Ipswich murders of five prostitutes by serial killer Steven Wright. \"One of the sad things is that everyone is equal before the law -- but the level of policing they get is often dependent on other issues.\"Newspaper tip-off ignored?When Benjamin Cohen, chief executive of LGBT news site PinkNews, was contacted by a friend of victim Gabriel Kovari asking him to investigate a link between the Barking murders, he says police dissuaded him from pursuing the story. \"They told us there wasn't a link between what was at that point three deaths,\" Cohen told CNN. \"Essentially, they gave the indication it would be a bad idea for us to report anything as it would cause people to be fearful.\"They were saying the deaths were not in suspicious circumstances,\" he added. \"But if it were three young women murdered in Islington or Hampstead and they had an inquiry from the Daily Mail, I cannot believe that would happen,\" Cohen said of the high-end London boroughs.Chillingly, it was Port who called the police pretending to be a bystander who spotted the body of his first murder victim Anthony Walgate. He was later arrested but only charged with perverting the course of justice and jailed for eight months.Port went on to kill three more men, and Cohen expresses disbelief that police were able to let the killer slip through their fingers so easily. \"I can imagine Netflix making this into a 10-part series where the murderer just keeps getting ignored,\" he said.'You don't have chemsex by yourself' Prosecutors said Port targeted victims on Grindr and other gay dating sites and apps, then plied them with drinks laced with fatal amounts of the drug GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, otherwise known as liquid ecstasy.He then raped them while they were unconscious and before they died, according to testimony at the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly known as the Old Bailey.Port dragged the bodies not far from his home and planted drugs on or near their bodies to make it look as though they had overdosed.Cohen believes another reason why police may have overlooked the serial killer's involvement, was \"because of the use of the drug GHB and its prevalence among the gay community.\"\"It's quite a problem in the gay community in London, of people using these drugs in chemsex,\" he said of the group sex sessions often organized through dating apps. GHB, along with crystal meth, is often associated with chemsex due to its ability to induce heightened arousal, sexual stamina, and reduce inhibition.Read more: What is chemsex? \"But the thing that's odd to me is, you don't have chemsex by yourself, you have chemsex with someone else,\" said Cohen. \"So if all of these people had been taking this drug, they must have been sleeping with someone to do it.\"That person was a lot closer than they thought.

{"_id":"Do Democrats regret the 'nuclear option' now that Trump will be president?","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Three years after using the \"nuclear option\" to upend Senate tradition by effectively removing filibusters against most presidential nominations, Senate Democrats insisted Thursday they don't regret that decision, even as Donald Trump becomes president and they recognize they may be powerless to block controversial nominations.\"I have absolutely no regret,\" said Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who led the charge to weaken the filibuster, freeing up scores of President Barack Obama's executive and judicial branch nominees. \"We'd never seen abuse of advice and consent in the history of our country so that was a necessary way to correct it.\" Frustrated by numerous GOP filibusters against Obama's nominees, Merkley and other junior Democrats in 2013 lobbied their leaders to change the rules. Senior Democrats initially were wary of the bold step, reminding their younger colleagues that they would not be in the majority forever and that the move could come back to haunt them. But in November of that year, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats became convinced GOP delaying tactics were crippling Washington. They triggered the nuclear option which -- over the objections of Republicans -- lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes.\"The supermajority was used as a tool to assault the executive branch and judicial branch and that was the only cure available was to make it a simple majority,\" recalled Merkley.Merkley has spent much of the past week targeting Trump's new chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who the senator said should be fired for being a \"white nationalist\" who \"specializes in hate.\" In news conferences, interviews, and floor speeches, Merkley and other Democrats pressed Trump to fire the controversial aide.While Bannon's west wing job doesn't require Senate confirmation, Merkley was asked by CNN if he would be sorry not to have the supermajority filibuster if Trump had named Bannon attorney general or some other top sensitive position that requires Senate approval.The liberal Merkley quoted Gandhi, who said an eye for an eye would make the whole world blind. \"If the minority is always paralyzing Congress, than Congress can never act to address problems,\" Merkley said. \"We live in a country as a democracy where a simple majority is the vision of how we make decisions. The majority makes decisions, not the minority.Other Democratic senators also stood by the nuclear option and said they would have other ways to hold accountable Trump's nominees.\"I generally oppose the filibuster and I'm going to vote my conscience on these nominees, particularly when it comes to conflict of interest and qualifications for the position,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. \"But my feeling generally is that the president should have the opportunity to select his team, and if he makes mistakes, he will be held accountable and so will they.\"Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, agreed. \"I think you start with the premise that presidents should have the right to name their cabinet. It's our job to do the oversight and scrutiny and review that's appropriate,\" he said. \"I'm not persuaded we should got back to the old way,\" Casey said, noting the 60-vote filibusters are still available for controversial legislation and Supreme Court nominations.However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham argued Democrats made a huge mistake triggering the nuclear option and it will lead to more strident nominees being confirmed. \"When you go simple majority you basically turn it over to one party and many times you get the harshest of the harsh,\" Graham said. \"I think they did the Senate a disservice.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/democrats-nuclear-option-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Do these village homes have the best view in China?","articleText":" (CNN)In the 1990s, life in Beigou Village was difficult. There was no running water or infrastructure, and very limited job opportunities. But over the past 20 years, the small village has seen a dramatic evolution. The key to its success has been its location: Beigou lies in the shadow of The Great Wall of China -- one of the world's most-visited tourist destinations, drawing more than 24 million visitors in 2009, according to a report by the Global Heritage Fund. Self-taught architectural designer Jim Spear and his wife Tang Liang, after visiting on vacation, saw what the Beigou villagers didn't: the value of their prime real estate. With help from the local government, the duo set out to increase tourism and strengthen the local economy with a series of architectural projects.\"People didn't really know they had some valuable real estate at first,\" says Spear. \"I was the first guy to kind of 'eat the crab', as the Chinese say. But, believe me, they caught on pretty fast.\"One of Spear's most successful projects was to transform an abandoned tile factory into Brickyard Retreat -- a boutique hotel that hires 80% of its employees from the surrounding villages. Why traditional-looking homes are now popular among elite ChineseSeveral similar projects have followed, with the award-winning designers focusing on transforming rundown properties into private residences and helping villagers lease their homes to tourists. Over the past two decades, Spear Designs has completed more than 30 weekend rural residences in and around Beijing.  The best views in ChinaWhile working and living in Beijing in the 1990s, Spear and Liang decided to renovate a village home in Mutianyu, about 50 miles (80km) north of the capital, as a weekend getaway. The area is home to clean air, easy access to hiking trails and, of course, has a front-row seat to the Great Wall. In 2005, the couple moved there full-time.Theirs was an unusual decision: the villages in this area were on a downward spiral, battling a declining population caused by both China's one-child policy and urbanization, as locals moved out to cities to find work. \"The economy was very bad 20 to 30 years ago,\" says Wang Quan, party secretary of Beigou Village. \"The only income source was a fruit plantation.\"After a nudge from the then town mayor, Spear embarked on a mission to buoy the economy and accelerate tourism through sustainable ventures, including Brickyard Retreat and several standalone rental homes. In 2006, they began investing in properties in the nearby Beigou Village.New opportunities in rural China\"Over the past 10 years, the Brickyard project has brought us a lot of financial support,\" says Wang. \"It has brought us cash, jobs and tourists.\"In addition, as tourism in the area has increased, many villagers have been able to lease out unused homes to make extra income. \"There's a whole movement in China for countryside houses and hotels,\" says Spear. \"People are cooped up in hives in the city. They want good, clean food and fresh air -- there's this idealized notion of the simple, good, country life.\"In accordance with Chinese property law, villagers can not sell the land their property sits on outright, but they can lease the right to use the house and the plot it sits on. Most leases run for 40 years.  \"The first few houses about 10 years ago were quite inexpensive because there was not yet demand,\" says Spear. \"Now the demand has ballooned and the local people (have enough money that they) don't have to lease their houses, and they are willing to wait for a better deal.\"A four-room, unimproved house today costs roughly $150,000 for a 40-year lease, up from $3,000 two decades ago. Meanwhile, Spear's designs have sold to both Chinese and foreign clients from anywhere between $300,000 and $3 million -- that includes the renovation and construction plans, as well as legal assistance to secure a 40-year lease. As most of the renovated properties serve as holiday homes, the makeup of permanent residents in the village has changed minimally over the past couple of decades. Spear estimates that across the four contiguous villages that make up the Great Wall International Cultural Village -- Tianxianyu, Beigou, Xinying and Mutianyu -- roughly 10% of homes have been leased to outsiders. Old roots, new leavesFor Spear a sustainable approach to construction has always been essential. From the outset, he chose to work with locally available materials, such as local rocks, granite, slate paving, and local fruitwood -- all assembled by local stonemasons and carpenters.And whenever possible, he installs eco-friendly features such as LED lighting and energy-efficient air-conditioning. But he also made one dramatic departure from tradition. Windows on traditional village homes always face the south, in order to insulate against northerly winter winds. By adding windows to the north side, Spear opened up each home to unparalleled views of the Great Wall. The views alone have been enough to attract attention from prospective homeowners, but Spear's minimalist style and contextual touch also lend to the appeal.Many traditional village homes have simple structures but good bones -- tiled roofs, latticed windows, big wood ceiling beams, and original masonry that Spear can often salvage. \"Every house that I design respects the old house that was first there,\" says Spear. \"I believe in design that speak to the existing community -- you don't want to overpower the area.\" \"I like to make sure there's light coming into the room from more than one side,\" says Spear. \"For instance, I often punch in little windows for surprise views.\"Romantic getaway One of Spear's designs, Stone Forest, was originally an abandoned three-room house. It has since been transformed in 2009 into a romantic getaway, complete with an outdoor shower, private courtyard, stained glass panels, and a terrace offering wrap-around views of the Great Wall. This year, Spear has scaled up his services with his biggest project yet: The Dashiyao Inn. The project's first of five phases will open in spring 2017.It is a collective investment by Jingxibei Real Estate Development Company and former residents of six abandoned mountain villages, who will all own shares in the 23-room, two-villa hotel. \"The residents feel a sense of ownership of their original homes, which is on communal land that's owned by the village,\" says Spear. \"If the resort makes money, they make money. They also benefit from reliable incomes and new jobs. There's training for hospitality, housekeeping, guards, landscaping, servers, and cooks, managers -- alternatives to agriculture and government work.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/architecture/beijing-luxury-village-homes/index.html"}
{"_id":"Do video games lead to violence?","articleText":" (CNN)The 18-year old gunman who killed nine people in Munich, Germany, on Friday was a fan of first-person shooter video games, according to reports. This detail in the unspooling story of the rampage led many to worry that violent video games may be negatively affecting their own children. What is the truth? Both the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics take a firm stance against children and teens playing violent video games. The psychological group reports that more than 90% of children in the United States play video games. Among kids between the ages of 12 and 17, the number rises to 97%. More important, 85% or more of video games on the market contain some form of violence. The titles seem to say it all: \"Manhunt,\" \"Thrill Kill,\" \"Gears of War\" and \"Mortal Kombat.\" However, even the seemingly benign \"Pokemon Go\" requires players to go to battle.The American Psychological Association observed in an August 2015 policy statement (PDF) that research demonstrated a link \"between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior ... and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement.\"In its July guideline on media violence, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that violent media set a poor example for kids. Video games, the academy noted, \"should not use human or other living targets or award points for killing, because this teaches children to associate pleasure and success with their ability to cause pain and suffering to others.\"  Overall, the academy's summary of the results from more than 400 studies revealed a \"significant\" link between being exposed to violent media (in general) and aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts and angry feelings. These clear, no-nonsense arguments appeal to many parents. However, they may not represent the views of the entire field. Some social scientists have come up with more unexpected results.Outdated advice?Whitney DeCamp, an associate professor of sociology at Western Michigan University, says the evidence points to either no relationship between playing video games and violent behavior or an \"insignificant\" link between the two. Sure, he said, some studies have revealed a connection between kids playing violent video games and violent behavior. But there is a problem with \"looking at those two things in a vacuum\": Kids who like to play brutal video games may have a predisposition toward aggression, he said. The real question, he said: Does playing violent games cause a person to act violently?In his own study (PDF), he examined that question using data from the 2008 Delaware School Survey, which included responses from 6,567 eighth-graders. Among the questions, students were asked whether they had played violent video games in the past year. DeCamp factored out the propensity to play violent video games (due to a natural attraction to brutality) along with other factors, such as gender and family relations. He discovered that playing video games, no matter how bloody, did not predict violent behavior.Christopher Ferguson, associate professor and co-chairman of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, supports this view. In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that violent video games may help reduce societal violence rather than increase it.\"Basically, by keeping young males busy with things they like\" -- and this would include everything from playing sports and collecting stamps to playing first-person shooter video games -- \"you keep them off the streets and out of trouble,\" he said. He added that newer studies \"with better methods\" have typically failed to find much evidence of a connection between brutal games and even minor aggressive acts, let alone violence.Persuasive evidence comes from an economic study published in January, which looked at violent criminal offenses in the weeks following the release of popular video games. Tracking both sales and crime rates, the authors discovered that general societal violence decreased in the weeks after the appearance of a new edition of a popular title. Obviously, this does not rule out longer-term effects, the authors admit. Still, they make a bid for the games offering \"cathartic\" effects, allowing players to safely release their aggression.While the debate rages on, Ferguson believes the tide has turned against linking video games to violence. There's more skepticism these days, he said, and recently, a group of 238 scholars asked the American Psychological Association to retire its \"outdated and problematic statements on video game violence.\"  Considering the teen shooter in Munich, DeCamp said, \"we need to take a lot of caution before we place the blame on any one particular thing.\" Meanwhile, Ferguson noted that \"almost all young males play violent video games,\" and yet the majority are not committing crimes. Both the psychological association and the American Academy of Pediatrics suggest that parents take an active interest in and monitor the games played by their children. This simple bit of practical advice -- and not an all-out prohibition -- may be the best solution.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/video-games-and-violence/index.html"}
{"_id":"Do you know what an IUD is? Many don't","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)On the very first episode of the MTV reality series \"Teen Mom,\" back in 2009, the cameras were rolling as Catelynn, one of the girls on the show, talked to her doctor about birth control. She made the decision to get a Mirena intrauterine device, known as an IUD; it's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and lasts for five years. Those facts are part of a concerted effort by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, working in conjunction with entertainment outlets such as MTV, to educate teens and young women about the range of birth control methods available to them.But judging by the results of a new survey by the Urban Institute, far too many women still don't know anything about the so-called longer-acting reversible contraceptives, the IUD and the implant, which are more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control pill and condoms.While 90% and 86% of women 18 to 44 were very aware of condoms and the pill respectively, only 31% said they heard a lot about IUDs and implants, according to the Urban Institute survey of roughly 800 women. \"It's not a surprise that women were most aware of the condom and birth control pills, but the lack of awareness of IUDs and, in particular, implants was definitely surprising,\" said Adele Shartzer, a research associate at the Urban Institute and one of the co-authors of the survey. \"I guess I just assumed that most women have at least heard of these methods, but it seems like they really haven't.\"'The IUD is not the IUD' of the pastAccording to the survey, 32% of women didn't know anything about the effectiveness of the implant, a tiny rod inserted in the arm that releases a hormone to prevent pregnancy. Nearly 20% said the same about the IUD. As for safety, 21% of the women surveyed said the IUD was either somewhat or very unsafe, and 23% felt the same way about implants.\"Part of it is that the IUD is not the IUD that it was 20, 30 years ago,\" said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In 1974, the Food and Drug Administration suspended the sale of an IUD known as the Dalkon Shield after reports of deaths and infections among users.\"And so if young women in particular are getting information from their mothers and their parents, the IUD and implant information that their mothers and parents have might not be accurate,\" she said.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in recommendations to doctors in 2011, said IUDs and implants are the most effective reversible contraceptives available and are safe to use by almost all women of reproductive age. These birth control methods can have some side effects, including irregular bleeding or no periods for Mirena IUD users, heavy bleeding or anemia for copper IUD users, or back pain and changing bleeding patterns for implant users.In 2009, 8.5% of women in the United States used an IUD or an implant, according to the Guttmacher Institute. That's up from 5.5% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2002.It's hard to know to what extent women head into their doctor's office with perceptions about IUDs and implants based on family or friends and already have said \"yes or no\" to themselves about different birth control options based on those perceptions, Shartzer said. \"IUDs, they're very safe now, but they do have, kind of from way back, a history of less-than-safe products, and if you're talking to your aunt or your grandmother about it, that may be kind of their perception. That's not in line with what the current products are,\" she said.Another factor in the lack of awareness may come down to supply: Women can get IUDs and implants only with a visit to a doctor, and they're not available everywhere. Not all doctors have been trained to recommend the methods to young women or are comfortable implanting the devices in patients. This may, in part, explain why women with knowledge gaps about IUDs and implants were more likely to be nonwhite, non-Hispanic and from lower income backgrounds, according to the new survey.  Women should have a full range of contraception available to them within 60 miles of where they live, and that's not always the case, said Ehrlich, of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\"And so for women who are seeing health care providers in places where these methods are not available ... we're hearing from health care providers that they don't talk about methods they don't have to offer women,\" she said.Changing the conversation around birth controlImproving access is certainly one way to raise awareness and increase the number of women using IUDs and implants, Ehrlich said. So is fine-tuning the way we talk about these methods. That is something she and her colleagues learned after teaming up with a consulting firm to do in-depth interviews (PDF) over a six-month period with a diverse group of 70 women between the ages of 18 and 29.They learned that calling these methods \"long-acting reversible contraceptives\" didn't resonate with the young women because they were concerned about the permanence of the methods, said Ehrlich. Talking about them as \"low-maintenance methods\" or \"party-ready methods\" for certain audiences seemed to resonate better, she said. Playing up how users don't have to think about these methods -- since they are effective for years and are not visible to anyone -- can also be effective in making women more comfortable with them, Ehrlich and her team learned from their interviews.\"We've come up with some ads to show that if someone has an implant, you can't see it ... so we've kind of integrated the insights into how we talk about those methods,\" she said.The Affordable Care Act might also lead to more awareness of IUDs and implants. As more women who are uninsured obtain health care coverage, they may be more likely to visit an OB/GYN and have conversations about birth control options, said Shartzer, of the Urban Institute.\"As people gain health insurance coverage and preventive care is covered to a greater extent, people may be more connected to a health care system, but that can take a while,\" she said.The teen birth rate has hit historic lows and the number of unplanned pregnancies dropped for the first time in decades, from 51% of all pregnancies between 2006 to 2010 to 45% between 2009 and 2013, according to a study this year.Still, the age group with the highest rate of unplanned pregnancies is 20- to 24-year-olds.Raising awareness about the most effective methods available to these young women is key to reducing unplanned pregnancy, experts say. So is respecting that IUDs and implants, while more effective than any birth control method beyond sterilization, may not be for the right fit for all women.\"We believe strongly that every woman should be able to choose the method of contraception she thinks is best for her, and so while (the IUD and implant) are incredibly reliable and effective, they may not be for everyone,\" Ehrlich said. \"That's something we have to be very careful about as well.\"Were you surprised by the big knowledge gaps about the different birth control methods?

{"_id":"Doctor: Separated twins 'right on target, if not ahead of schedule'","articleText":"New York (CNN)The twins who were joined at the head and underwent a 27-hour surgery last month to separate them are progressing \"right on target, if not ahead of schedule,\" the lead neurosurgeon tells CNN. \"As a neurosurgeon, I guess it puts you in a happy mood,\" said Dr. James Goodrich, who led the operation at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York.The surgery on the 13-month old twins, Jadon and Anias McDonald, captivated millions around the world. The procedure, known as craniopagus surgery, is so rare that it has been conducted only 59 times since 1952.CNN was allowed exclusive access to the surgery and the McDonald family. Christian and Nicole McDonald have been buoyed by the outpouring of support from around the world and have asked for space as their family heals. Both boys have had their breathing tubes removed since the operation, which began the morning of October 13 and ended shortly before 1 p.m. October 14. Jadon had suffered partial paralysis of his left side after the surgery, but he has since regained full functionality. Anias suffered seizures postoperatively, but they have been kept in check with medication. \"I don't think that is going to be a long-term issue with him,\" Goodrich said.Nicole held Jadon for the first time in late October, a moment she had dreamed of since before the twins were born.  The twins are doing so well, Goodrich says, he hopes that in coming weeks, \"we'll have them both out of here, off to rehab.\"Added Dr. Oren Tepper, the lead plastic surgeon charged with reconstructing the boys' skulls, \"All in all, I think they've handled the surgery incredibly well. ... They've been entirely stable in the ICU since the operating room, and I think that, in and of itself, is a real success.\"Jadon and Anias' craniopagus surgery was the seventh performed by Goodrich. He and Tepper headed up a team of more than 30 people at Montefiore, from anesthesiologists and radiologists to nurse practitioners.Here, for the first time, the surgical team describes in their own words the key moments inside the operating room and what it was like to be a part of such a rare surgery. The quotes have been edited for length and clarity.'We would've lost one or both children'Goodrich said the \"most unexpected surprise\" came hours into the surgery, when the team learned that the boys' brains were fused more than they realized. When the boys first arrived at the hospital months ago, the twins shared about 1.5 centimeters in diameter of brain tissue, but as they grew during their stay, so did the fused tissue. Going into the surgery, doctors believed the twins had about 3.8 centimeters in diameter of fused brain. Once they operated, they found that it was even larger.\"When we actually got in there, their brains were totally fused. It was a bigger fusion than we expected in the sense it was about 5 centimeters by 7 centimeters. For a child that size, that's a good chunk of tissue, but we had to separate them, and so to do that, it was a matter of just picking a plane between the two. Intraop, we'd done some beautiful imaging studies of the venous anatomy, but as has always been the case, when you get down in there, it's even more complex than you realized when you started.\"There was a very large venous complex that had a huge potential of bleeding, and if we lost control of that, we would've lost one or both children. I took in extra time, and we added another four hours onto the case to get the exposure, and we eventually found a nice window, which just kind of opened up, and we followed it down. \"The problem with these, these veins are abnormal. They're very thin, and if they rupture, you have no way of controlling them. It's a situation where you have to have total control all the way through, because once you lose it, you can't back off. I was at a point that I was wondering whether we were going to lose both kids if one of those things broke. Then again, after discussion with various members of the team, we picked an avenue that was safe -- and it worked.\"I'm just glad it wasn't my first craniopagus surgery. That would've been ominous. This is now our seventh set that we've separated. Every one of them had their own unique idiosyncracies. These kids, in the sense of the vascularity, I actually thought they were going to be simpler. Simpler is not the right word, but less complex than what we'd done before. But in actual fact, they turned out to be as equally complex as any of them. They were a challenge.\"Pediatric neurosurgery nurse practitioner Kamilah Dowling stayed in touch with the parents throughout the surgery, updating them about every two to three hours. \"I would text Nicole or give her a call. First, I would check with Dr. Goodrich to see where are we now, what are we doing, and this is what I am going to tell Nicole. If we were having blood pressure issues, anything that was going on at that moment, I would share with Nicole. I feel that we did our job as nurse practitioners. We supported the family from beginning to end. We'll continue to support them emotionally, anything they need.\"'The biggest hurdle'Tepper, the lead plastic surgeon during the operation, says he feels relieved at this point. He describes the pivotal moment of the surgery, when Goodrich studied the intricately fused brains and proceeded ahead. \"I mean, that was really the final decision point whether this was possible or not, and ultimately, Dr. Goodrich really was the one to make that decision. What it required was all of us putting our heads together and saying, 'Well, let's determine if we think this is possible.' That's where radiology became crucial. Dr. Joaquim Farinhas of radiology was essential looking at the anatomy. I think having the whole team there to say, 'This is what needs to be done. This is how we can approach it. This is what we need to get there.' It was really important that we were all there to make that decision and say, 'Well, this is the point of essentially no return.'\"We knew their anatomy was complex. All the imaging that we had done beforehand tells you that. But until you're actually seeing and feeling the tissues, you cannot predict those moments. I think getting to that point and realizing that this was possible was incredible.\"For me, I think the big emotional change was when they were actually separated. I hadn't seen twins be separated before ... and for me, that final moment when we were able to take those two beds and separate them apart was like nothing else I've ever seen.\"I feel relieved at this point. I think there was a lot of concern, obviously, going in. We knew this was going to be a big undertaking, and I think things went as well as we could've hoped for at this point. I think that the biggest hurdle -- getting them through this operation safely and getting them separated -- we've gotten past. We're excited about that.\"'Emotional toll on all of us'Drs. Rani Nasser and Ajit Jada, chief residents of neurosurgery, have performed hundreds of surgeries, but nothing quite compared to the craniopagus surgery to separate Jadon and Anias. They said the success came down to \"pure teamwork,\" with Goodrich leading the \"orchestra.\" One of the trickiest moments for them came when the boys were rotated, and doctors were trying to determine whose vascularity was whose.Nasser: \"Because the brains fuse together, and it's really hard to know when Jadon ends and Anias begins. And that's really when we were wondering, 'Is this Jadon? Is this Anias?' Honestly, to this day, I think without 3-D modeling and printing, we would've not been able to decipher this as easily. It really was pure teamwork and having many sets of eyes on this.\"I've seen the boys grow up. I've literally seen them grow up. Half their lives, you know. Every time anesthesia raised a concern, we listened. And we listened, and we were frightened, but we were focused, and we worked together and gave each other strength to make it happen.\"Jada: \"I think the pivotal moment for me was when we had bleeding from the sides.\"Nasser: \"Right.\"Jada: \"Normally, you have time to control the blood. And these kids are small, and it was challenging, because we only had 10 seconds, basically, to control the blood before the pressure started going down.\"Nasser: \"If at all, right?\"Jada: \"The anesthesiologists were saying 'pressure's 100 over 60, pressure's 60 over 50.' And you hear that going on.\"Nasser: \"The number's going down. ...\"Jada: \"And you're reacting quickly to stop the bleeding at the same time. So that, I felt, was one of the most challenging aspects of the surgery. Or in general, any surgery I've ever done.\"Nasser: \"Every time we were over one obstacle, there were three others. With that perseverance, we were able to do it, but it definitely took an emotional toll on all of us.\"'Please, let them see'Esther Uy, the patient care coordinator for neurosurgery, was in charge of five nurses and four surgical technicians during the operation. She's been at Montefiore for 34 years, and Goodrich credits her with helping his surgeries run smoothly. She describes her emotions when the surgeons reached the most critical juncture.\"All I was thinking was, 'Please, let them see where it is the right place to separate them.' That is most important. If they made a wrong move on where to cut or where to clip, it will be a disastrous result. But with the help of the models and Dr. Joaquim Farinhas showing Dr. Goodrich where to go, they were able to do it safely without disaster. That's the one that we were so afraid of. Any time, anything can happen, but Dr. Goodrich delivered.\"It is very rewarding to see them separate. It's a miracle already, to see them separated.\"'Under the drapes'Three anesthesiologists -- Drs. Carlene Broderick, Glenn Mann and Madelyn Kahana -- worked beneath the drapes to keep the boys alive throughout the procedure. The surgery took 27 hours, from the first cut to the last stitch. However, the anesthesiologists' job began three hours before the first cut as they prepped the children. Broderick: \"I was ecstatic to be involved with the McDonald twins' surgeries. I was involved with the Aguirre twins in 2004, so we knew we could do it. But this time, we had more confidence. In one word, the entire surgery was miraculous!\"Kahana: \"When the children are joined, they share circulation in some capacity, and invariably they share some commonality about the drugs that we give and, depending upon where they're joined, even the way we mechanically ventilate them during anesthesia. We have to know what each other is doing at all times, because what I would do for one twin would effect the child that Dr. Mann was caring for and vice versa. So communication was constant.\"Mann: \"We were always learning how that sort of interaction was happening from the first time we took care of them, straight through to the last time. It was always a little different. ...\"Going under the drapes is sort of what we do. The surgeons are above the drapes, and we're below the drapes, making sure the patient is safe. The most important thing is the maintenance of the airway, and we're constantly checking the airway, the breathing tube that both the boys have. Throughout the surgery, they were repositioned multiple times, and our job was to make sure that the tube didn't come out at any point, because that would just be a devastating thing to happen during the operation. That's one thing we're doing. At the same time, all our IV access and drugs that we're giving are under the drapes.\"What was the most intense moment during the surgery?Kahana: \"It was all Anias. It seemed like every time Dr. Goodrich got anywhere near the dura (the outermost membrane that envelopes the brain), Anias' blood pressure plummeted. That happened over a fairly long period of time, because he was dissecting around the dura for hours. There were many times for, really fortunately, seconds that Anias' blood pressure would fall fairly precipitously and require multiple vasoactive substances being administered.  We had probably about five hours of intermittent, fairly profound blood pressure changes to deal with to the point where Dr. Mann was refilling my syringes for me because I was going through them at such a fast pace. \"Sometimes, we just have to say, 'Stop or get control of the bleeding, hold pressure, give me a minute!' And that's what they do.\"Building confidenceDr. Joaquim Farinhas, a neuroradiologist, was credited by many in the operating room as being the key in helping the surgeons navigate through what he called the \"lake of veins.\" He deflects such praise, saying he was simply doing his job. \"It's a combination of what I provide them as a map and my confidence in their skills. I can tell them, 'Please, you know what's on the left side here. This is delicate; stay away from that side.' But they're the ones who are making that final decision. We're just trying to keep them on track and give them as much confidence as we can.\"I think that was the most important part. I had to take a role there, and that was my job, to give them the confidence. Dr. Goodrich cut that connection and had to be confident that it was going to be successful. And I think that worked out well.\" When 'one turned into two'Dr. Carrie Stern, senior resident of plastic and reconstructive surgery, participated throughout the surgery. She made the official final cut to separate the boys. At 2:11 a.m., the twins became officially separated. That was about 16½ hours into the surgery.\"All the difficult aspects of the surgery had been completed by the entire team -- from splitting the bone, the brain, all the difficult blood vessels that needed to be separated between Anias and Jadon -- and really the only part that remained was a small skin bridge. Dr. Tepper had asked, 'Who wants the final cut?' And I just seized the moment: Grabbed the scissors and cut.\"It felt good. It was exciting. It was amazing to see the two beds slowly pull apart. As Dr. Goodrich said, 1 millimeter at a time. It was just incredible to see the one turn into two.\"'Very, very rewarding'Dr. Michael Ushay, director of the pediatric critical care unit, says it was an awesome moment the first time the boys were in the same room \"in separate beds and separated from each other.\"\"This is pretty extraordinary. I remember when Dr. Goodrich did his last conjoined twins here, and that was before I'd actually come to Montefiore, and it was very, very exciting. Now, to be part of it on such a complicated case is very, very rewarding. I've always enjoyed working with kids through complex operations. This has got to be one of the most complex operations, and to have them come through it. When they're together and you're meeting them, you wonder, 'How are they ever going to do this?' But they did it. That was great. The kids look really good.\"CNN's Roni Selig contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/health/conjoined-twins-surgical-team/index.html"}
{"_id":"Doctors must lead us out of our opioid abuse epidemic","articleText":" (CNN)Veteran doctors don't need a blood test to tell when someone is on the verge of a drug overdose. They can even narrow down the culprit by observation alone. Dilated pupils mean cocaine, amphetamines, maybe LSD. Constricted pupils mean an opiate. Additionally, an opiate abuser is characteristically \"nodding out\" and often scratching their itchy skin. While their face is becoming pale and clammy, their fingernails and lips are starting to turn blue or even a sickly purplish-black. When the choking noises -- or the deep snore gurgling sounds, known as the death rattle -- begins, it's time to act -- and fast. That is a pretty clear sign the opiates have just turned off the person's drive to breathe and they are in the throes of an overdose.It is an awful sight, and yet someone in this country dies like this every 19 minutes. There is no other medication routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently. The majority of those deaths result from prescription opioid medications, such as hydrocodone, OxyContin and Percocet. It is so common that specialists even have a profile for the most typical victim: non-Hispanic Caucasian male, mid 30s. Initial diagnosis: back pain due to trauma, surgery or degenerative arthritis. And, most remarkably, average time from first prescription to time of overdose death: just 31 months. This is a public health epidemic and one that is uniquely American. No other country in the world has the perverse amount of consumption as we do in the United States. And nowhere do we pay the price as dearly as with prescription opioid medications. As of 2011, 75% of the world's opioid prescription drugs are prescribed and swallowed up in a country that makes up less than 5% of the world's population, leading to the most common cause of unintentional death in America today -- drug overdoses.  It is a horrifying and shameful statistic.And, having traveled all over the world covering natural disaster, wars and famine, I am fully confident we Americans don't have 75% of the world's pain.Who is at fault?There is plenty of blame to go around. Drugs are cheaper than a multidisciplinary approach to treating pain, and cost savings are what insurance companies like to hear. For decades, certain pharmaceutical companies misled the FDA about the risks of opioid dependence in an effort to sell more of the drugs, and three top executives from Purdue Pharma even pleaded guilty to those criminal charges. Our federal government has created nearly insurmountable hurdles to studying other therapies such as medicinal marijuana, which has for years been used safely and effectively in other countries for chronic neuropathic pain, one of the most difficult types to treat.Most of the blame, however, belongs on the shoulders of the American doctors themselves. I am a practicing neurosurgeon, and this is not an easy thing to acknowledge. The fact is, we have accepted the tall tales and Pollyannaish promises of what these medications could do for too long. As a community, we weren't skeptical enough. We didn't ask enough questions. We accepted flimsy scientific data as gospel and preached it to our patients in a chamber that echoed loudly for decades. Even worse, too many doctors who didn't actually believe the hyperbole surrounding opioids doled out long-term prescriptions regardless, in the same way doctors write antibiotic prescriptions for viral illnesses. In both cases, they don't work. In both cases, they can cause colossal harm. The King of PainIt was a particular  American doctor who, in many ways, started all of this. If you want to identify a specific moment this opioid epidemic sprouted wings, many would point to a paper written 30 years ago this month. Based on a study of just 38 patients in 1986, Dr. Russell Portenoy challenged the conventional wisdom. Up until that time, opioids had been reserved for cancer patients and palliative care and only for short durations because of the concern about addiction. Dr. Portenoy, armed with his small study, believed prescription opioids could safely be used in all patients with chronic pain for years on end. He maintained that the drugs were easy to quit and that overdoses hardly ever occurred. Along with several others, Portenoy cited a single-paragraph letter to the editor from the New England Journal of Medicine stating that less than 1% of opioid users would become physically dependent or addicted. As it turns out, almost none of this was true. When we reached recently retired Dr. Hershel Jick, author of the oft-quoted \"1% letter,\" he was quick to point out that his statistic was misrepresented. It was intended to represent only patients prescribed opioids in the hospital who were carefully monitored. He told us he never anticipated the remarkable impact a one-paragraph letter would have in the decades to follow. Even Portenoy, once mockingly referred to as the King of Pain, appears to have recanted and apologized for his part in walking the American people into an abyss of addiction. There is no question that many people suffer unimaginable chronic pain, and we don't want to solve the epidemic by impeding their ability to obtain pain relief. But the truth is, they deserve medications better suited for the job. They deserve medications that uncouple powerful analgesia from terrible addictive potential. They deserve medications that don't cause hyperalgesia, a syndrome of increased pain necessitating escalating doses of opioids. Most of all, they deserve to have doctors who rely on scientific evidence that is solid, not fanciful.Where we standWe have a long way to go.  Instead of safer pain therapeutics, patients are now being offered expensive new medications that only treat the consequences of the opioid epidemic. With 259 million opioid prescriptions being written yearly, it turns out side effects -- such as constipation -- are a big enough business to warrant its own Super Bowl commercial. There are other grim signs. We now know that heroin has made a resurgence and 80% of new heroin users start off using pain pills, which contain the same type of base ingredients.Most disturbing, however, is a recent study showing that 91% of people who survived an overdose were still able to get another opioid prescription, typically from the same prescribing doctor. Not only are we failing to learn and make progress, it seems we are turning a blind eye to the tragedies unfolding right in front of us.A doctor call to actionAs policymakers begin to catch on, rules and regulations will start to change. As part of a discussion I moderated with President Obama last month, we learned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now recommending against doctors prescribing opioids for most chronic pain situations. When a prescription is written, it should be for the lowest effective dose and the shortest amount of time: usually just a few days. Pills will also come with safeguards to make them difficult to abuse and discourage \"doctor-shopping,\" as well as a strong warnings about addiction -- something we doctors should have been diligent about all along.But most simply, we as doctors need to engage our patients and discuss treatment with them, whether its short term opioids or alternatives like physical and occupational therapy. We need to help set realistic expectations for our patients: Living entirely pain free is not always possible. As doctors, we need to have follow-up conversations with our patients to see how treatment is going. If we better understand our patients, we can provide better treatment and help develop pain strategies that are effective and safe. It is not too late. In order for this American-made epidemic to finally end, however, it is the American doctors who must lead the way.Editor's Note: A previous version of this article mistakenly stated that drug overdoses were the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. It should have stated drug overdoses were the leading cause of unintentional death.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/05/11/health/sanjay-gupta-prescription-addiction-doctors-must-lead/index.html"}
{"_id":"Dodo skeleton, 'icon of extinction,' sold for $431,000","articleText":"London (CNN)The dodo may be long gone, but it is certainly not forgotten: An \"extremely rare\" almost complete example of the extinct bird's skeleton has sold for £346,300 ($431,341) at a UK auction.A dedicated collector spent more than 40 years buying up individual bones at sales, and piecing the composite skeleton together -- only part of the skill and one set of claws are missing.The specimen was dubbed the \"superstar\" of the Evolution-themed sale at Summers Place auction house in Sussex, southeastern England.Erroll Fuller, the sale's curator and author of Dodo: From Extinction to Icon, told CNN he had \"always expected the skeleton to be one of our most popular pieces.\" Fuller said the story of the dodo had fascinated generations of natural history fans.\"The dodo barely looks like a bird,\" he explained. \"It has been incredibly popular since 1865 when Lewis Carroll introduced the bird as a character in Alice in Wonderland, but it had been an icon even before.\"In a way it represents extinction and how fast man can influence the environment. After humans introduced monkeys and dogs in the environment and started to massively hunt the dodo, it disappeared.\"The dodo, native to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, was first spotted by European sailors in the 16th century, but became extinct by 1681; its inability to fly made it easy prey for human hunters and predators such as dogs.Most of the remaining dodo skeletons are held in natural history museums across the globe, from London, Paris and Leiden to Durban and Washington.Fuller said the mixing and matching of different dodo bones was not usual. \"There are only twelve close to complete dodo skeletons in the world,\" Fuller told CNN. \"There is only one dodo skeleton that comes from a full bird. The others are all composites of different dodos.\" Most were found in the Mare aux Songes swamp, in the island of Mauritius, in the 19th century, Fuller said.\"The story goes that people were walking through the swamp when someone reached out into the muddy waters and started pulling out bird bones,\" he said. The government of Mauritius has since banned all exports of Dodo bones, which meant there was a lot of interest in the Summers Place sale, which also featured game trophies and natural history artifacts.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/world/dodo-skeleton-sold-at-auction/index.html"}
{"_id":"Does 'cage-free' mean a better life for chickens?","articleText":"Massachusetts is the latest state to vote on a ballot initiative to increase the amount of space that animals are allowed in industrial food production systems. It prohibits keeping pigs, cows and egg-laying hens in tight confinement (PDF) that \"prevents the animal from lying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs, or turning around freely.\"You might think its passage is a major moral victory, at least for chickens, but is it? As a philosophy professor who's worked on food issues for my entire career, I've come to believe that questions of animal welfare are more complicated than they seem at first glance. It's not a clear choice which of the possible living conditions for egg-laying hens -- enriched cages, cage-free systems, free-range setups -- serve them the best.What does humanity owe chickens, anyway?The philosophical question of whether animals deserve any kind of moral consideration has been debated at least since the ancient Greeks.At one far end of the spectrum are those who say nonhumans cannot be regarded as proper subjects of moral concern. Some hold this on the basis of divine revelation -- the other animals were put here for humankind to use as they see fit -- while others deny that animals have the kind of subjectivity or experience that could give rise to a moral duty or obligation on our part. The 16th-century philosopher Rene Descartes likened animals to machines.Why it's impossible to actually be a vegetarianAll the way at the other end of the spectrum are those who argue that what we owe to animals is not unlike what we owe to each other. We should not kill them, nor should we cause them pain or suffering save under highly unusual circumstances. We certainly should not eat them.Eggs occupy a theoretically ambiguous place on this spectrum, as it is possible to produce them without killing any chickens. Nevertheless modern egg production does involve killing chickens. First, virtually all male chicks are destroyed within a few moments of hatching (though the egg industry has pledged to end this practice by 2020, using technology to determine the sex of fertilized eggs rather than waiting for chicks to hatch).And egg producers will not bear the expense of continuing to feed hens after they have gotten too old to lay eggs. When the rate of lay declines, henhouses are \"depopulated,\" meaning birds are removed, killed and their carcasses are composted. As such, those who occupy the ethical vegetarian end of the animal ethics spectrum are no more supportive of the egg industry than they are of beef or pork production.What's best for the hens?Egg production has been a key target of animal welfare initiatives because at one time layers were so crowded that they literally had to stand on top of one another in the wire cages used by the modern egg industry. We can't be sure these stocking densities have been entirely eliminated, but the vast majority of table eggs today come from chickens that have at least enough space to stand on the floor of their cage.More important than these increased space allotments is the introduction of amenities that clearly matter to chickens: nest boxes, scratch pads and perches. These enhancements allow the birds to engage in the perching, dust-bathing, nesting and foraging behaviors they are highly motivated to perform.By 2010, a consensus emerged among producers and some activists for moving to much larger cages that provided opportunities for most of chickens' natural behaviors -- the so-called enriched or colony cage. From the producer perspective, enriched cages represented the best compromise between slightly higher costs and improved welfare for hens. But recent pledges to source eggs from cage-free facilities have virtually taken the opportunity for enriched cages off the table. And that is where the moral uncertainty begins to turn wicked.Out of the cage, into the fireCage-free and free-range systems clearly do a better job of allowing hens to express behaviors that are similar to those of wild jungle fowl. They can move around, and they have better opportunities for scratching, dust bathing and foraging. However, in comparison to enriched cages, hens in cage-free and free-range facilities suffer injuries simply because they move around more. Access to the outdoors often means that predators also have access to hens, and some are inevitably taken by hawks, foxes or the like.A curious ethical point is that people seem to be roughly split on whether being chased and eaten by a hawk or a dog is a bad thing from a chicken's perspective. In research done at Oklahoma State University, 40 percent of respondents saw the suffering of animals as the root issue for ethics, while 46 percent judged that pain, suffering or discomfort would not be significant if it was consonant with what an animal would experience in nature. Getting eaten by predators is certainly what chickens and their close relatives experience in the wild. (The remaining 14 percent of people surveyed didn't care much about animal welfare beyond being sure that animals' basic needs are met.)Further complicating the \"freedom\" of cage-free and free-range enclosures, hens will peck one another in an effort to establish a dominance order. In small groups (the 40 to 60 birds that would be found in the enriched-cage system), this behavior generally recedes. But in flocks of 100,000 or more chickens, the least dominant birds can be subjected to so much pecking from other hens that their welfare is clearly worse than it would be in an enriched cage. Welfare scientists tend to favor aviaries (cage-free) over floor systems (free-range) because they allow better perching and thus give less dominant birds better places to hide.How to satisfy our appetite for meat without ruining the planetEgg producers limit the damage that birds can do to each other by trimming off the sharp tip of their beak (which is also controversial). Even still, higher mortality from pecking gets treated as a cost of business in cage-free production facilities.It is possible to house chickens in groups of 40 to 60 birds where pecking orders become stable quickly, but the roughly 6' by 12' enclosures for these groups look suspiciously like a cage to most people. This option may no longer be an option, however. Not only do ballot initiatives like the one in Massachusetts pass with overwhelming support, grocery stores and many chain restaurants are now pledging to abandon suppliers who utilize cages over the next five to 10 years.With the best of intentionsEgg production seems to be especially susceptible to actions where the public is highly confident that they're in the right -- even while many who've look closely at the alternatives are far less sure about how it feels to be a chicken in these operations.Massachusetts voters thought chickens -- as well as the pigs and cows that become pork and veal -- would be better off in less tight quarters. Since the ban applies to the sale of any products from animals raised in restrictive cages, the ballot measure could have repercussions for food suppliers based far beyond Massachusetts. Opponents of the initiative predict the price of a dozen eggs will spike.Can science stop the looming banana extinction?So do chickens benefit from more space, and should we turn them out of their cages? If we are trying to help them live a more natural kind of existence, then maybe we should. If we are interested in limiting the injuries they suffer from being pecked by other birds, as well as from getting hunted and killed by hawks, dogs and other predators, maybe not.Paul B.

{"_id":"Does marijuana weaken heart muscles?","articleText":" (CNN)Just last week, five more states voted to legalize recreational marijuana, but users may want to be cautious. A study released Sunday suggests that marijuana use can weaken heart muscles, particularly in young men. The study was presented at the annual scientific conference of the American Heart Association in New Orleans. Recognizing the possible adverse health effects of smoking pot to get high, the researchers examined the link between marijuana use and heart health. Marijuana users vs. non-users The researchers, from St. Luke's University Hospital Network, focused on patients with stress cardiomyopathy, a sudden temporary weakening of the heart muscle that prevents it from pumping. Patients with the condition, which has been said to mimic a heart attack, can experience acute chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness. The muscle weakness is most often caused by acute stress or grief, such as a breakup or the death of a loved one. However, according to Dr. Amitoj Singh, the lead investigator of the study, at least two cases of stress cardiomyopathy in medical literature have been related to marijuana use. \"There have been many reports of heart attacks, strokes and the two cases of (stress cardiomyopathy) that have been linked to marijuana,\" Singh said. Greater availability of marijuana, particularly for recreational use, has heightened concern in the medical community about cardiac risks, sparking Singh's interest.Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2003 to 2011, the researchers tracked hospital admissions and outcomes of 33,343 patients with stress cardiomyopathy. The data were taken from across the country and represented both men and women of varied ages. Two groups were formed from the data: one group of marijuana users (which had 210 patients, or 1% of the total study pool) and a group of patients who did not use the drug. Each group was strikingly different in terms of demographics, medical histories and outcomes. The marijuana users tended to be younger and more often male, a finding that was surprising to Singh, because stress cardiomyopathy most often occurs in older women, he said. Marijuana users also had fewer risk factors that typically cause stress cardiomyopathy, such as acute stress, hypertension, diabetes, migraines and hyperthyroidism. The non-marijuana-using group had much higher rates of these conditions.\"Even though these young people had less cardiac risk factors, they still had high cardiac risk,\" Singh said. Marijuana users also suffered more severe cardiac problems. \"Despite being younger and with fewer cardiovascular risk factors than non-users, during stress cardiomyopathy, the marijuana users were significantly more likely to go into cardiac arrest (2.4% vs. 0.8%) and to require an implanted defibrillator to detect and correct dangerously abnormal heart rhythms (2.4% vs. 0.6%),\" the American Heart Association said of the study in a news release. Investigating further, the researchers created a model that excluded all of the known causes of stress cardiomyopathy to see whether marijuana use alone could trigger the condition. They found a statistically significant relationship between the drug and stress cardiomyopathy, Singh said. \"Someone who uses marijuana is almost two times more likely to develop stress cardiomyopathy,\" he explained. However, the report also found that marijuana users were more likely to use tobacco and illicit substances, as well as suffer from depression, than non-marijuana users. Dr. Ann Bolger, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, said these factors can contribute to stress cardiomyopathy. \"It's hard to know exactly that you can account for all of these other contributors\" when determining causation of the condition, she said. Should you avoid marijuana?Bolger agrees with the overall concern raised by the new study. \"It does give me some very appropriate worry that exposure to (marijuana) may not be as benign as some people seem to think.\" She added that \"If this is in some way predictive of poor outcomes or indicative that we need to have concern about the cardiovascular health and outcomes of patients using marijuana, I think it's a very good thing to start to think about.\" Singh acknowledges that marijuana has several benefits in medicine, particularly with treatments such as chemotherapy. \"We don't want to underestimate the benefits of medical marijuana,\" he confirmed. Still, Singh wants to draw attention to the potential harms of recreational use. The lack of regulation makes it difficult for users to know the amount of THC, the psychosis-inducing chemical in marijuana, contained in a dose, which can be dangerous. Singh is still not certain whether THC is principally responsible for users' cardiac problems; that is a topic that needs to be further studied, he said.

And NBC's follow-up movie, subtitled \"Circle of Love,\" actually manages to be sappier and more infused with Christmas spirit than the last one, which frankly didn't seem possible.Indeed, to those ensconced in red states prone to gripe that the major networks ignore religion, this Hallmark Channel-like offering proves that godless Hollywood likes the green in Christmas just fine. And it's all presented so earnestly that \"Circle of Love\" should connect with the same audience, meaning all concerned should probably begin making plans for next year right now.Introduced by Parton as \"another true story of a Christmas miracle that happened during my childhood\" (how many of those do most people get?), the movie picks up in 1955, where the young Dolly (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and her family remain dirt poor but filled with love and faith. Yet God seems determined to keep testing them, prompting characters to ask how they can continue to believe, only to have their piety rewarded.This latest effort comes with a sort-of \"Gift of the Magi\" theme, as Dolly's parents (Jennifer Nettles, Ricky Schroder) puzzle over how to scrape together money to let each of the children receive a \"store-bought\" gift. When he brings up the subject of that wedding ring he never bought her, she pluckily replies, \"After eight kids, I'm just about as married as I can get.\"Nevertheless, the family will be forced to contemplate just how they want to spend money -- for themselves, or others -- as well as face disasters both natural (a blizzard) and man-made (a coal mine cave-in). And yes, Dolly's budding desire to perform again figures into the story, this time by hungering for the role of Mary in the school's Christmas pageant.Parton even drops in as a painted lady that interacts with her younger self, which mostly contributes to the comedy factor, as the little girl gushes about wanting to look just like her when she grows up.To the extent it works, credit the cast (including Gerald McRaney as Dolly's minister grandpa) and some of the little touches in Pamela K. Long's script, like Dolly's first brush with indoor plumbing.NBC will pair the movie with its annual \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" special, creating one big, festive night of holiday cheer. And while cynics can snort at all the movie clichés that somehow found their way into Parton's childhood memories, the net effect no doubt creates the ideal environment to sell advertising for lots of \"store-bought\" items.\"Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors: Circle of Life\" airs November 30 at 9 p.m. on NBC.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/entertainment/dolly-partons-circle-of-love-review/index.html"}

Trump is the Pillsbury Doughboy","articleText":"Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and currently is \"of counsel\" to the New York law firm of Edelman and Edelman, PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him @paulcallan. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)Lawyers often practice a second occupation: psychiatrist to their worried friends and family. 2016 has been a banner year for any \"counselor at law\" like me with a strong side-interest in politics. This year, I want to share -- in the interests of a peaceful Thanksgiving weekend for all -- a message I have conveyed to my apoplectic liberal and \"progressive\" friends, who are shaking in fear at the prospect of the Trump inauguration. Donald Trump is not going to blow up the world. He is not going turn America into the Third Reich, nor is he going to doom minorities, women, gays and transgender people to a life of hatred, gloom and despair.He is not anti-Semitic. His daughter, Ivanka converted to Judaism before marrying his loved and respected orthodox Jewish son-in-law, Jared Kushner.  In fact, I predict Trump's presidency will be a reign of moderation, because — to borrow from of one of the many impressive balloons that will float above the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade --Trump is the Pillsbury Doughboy. And the Doughboy gets the baking done.Like our doughboy, Trump has no rigid ideological core. The lack of this trait was the thing most right-wing conservatives feared about him throughout the early days of the primary season. In fact even President Obama, while graciously offering a note of optimism regarding the Trump presidency, observed that Trump is a \"pragmatist and not an ideologue.\" Trump's flexible political ideology helped Hillary and Bill Clinton snag front-row seats at Trump's third wedding in 2005, that time to our soon-to-be first lady, Melania Trump. Bill and Hillary were not forced to endure any self-righteous sermons regarding the proper political philosophy, like those inflicted on soon-to-be Vice President Mike Pence recently when he attended the Broadway show \"Hamilton.\"  On the contrary, Trump was a major supporter of Democratic Party causes in those years. Democrats in attendance needed no lectures. And just as a side note: Republicans don't get divorced and remarried three times. Two appears to be the maximum number of marriages permitted (see Ronald Reagan.)

{"_id":"Donald Trump blasts recount as 'ridiculous' and 'a scam'","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump ripped the election recount on Saturday, calling it \"a scam\" and \"ridiculous\" and noting that Hillary Clinton had already conceded.Trump charged in a statement that the effort was nothing but a fundraising ploy by the Green Party and its nominee, Jill Stein.\"This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn't even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,\" the President-elect said in a statement, which labeled the effort as \"ridiculous\" in a headline.On Saturday night, Trump tweeted, \"The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems.\"Stein has already raised more than $5 million online for the recount in Wisconsin, which may begin some time next week.Appearing on CNN, Stein dismissed Trump's suggestion that the funds wouldn't be spent on the recount.\"For his information, this is all going into a dedicated and segregated account so that it can only be spent on the recount,\" she told CNN's Pamela Brown on \"Newsroom.\"\"He may be creating his own facts here as he's been known to do some times in the past,\" Stein added. \"He himself said it was rigged election unless he won it.\"'The people have spoken'Trump said, \"The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, 'We must accept this result and then look to the future.'\"The President-elect said he won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by \"large numbers\" and noted his margin of more than 70,000 in Pennsylvania.\"This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,\" Trump said.Just hours after he issued his statement, Trump launched into one of his trademark tweetstorms Sunday morning, reiterating his points. \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\" he tweeted.And then he quoted Clinton's own concession statement, writing: \" 'Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.'

{"_id":"Donald Trump could meet the Queen in 2017","articleText":"London (CNN)Just over a week after revealing his mother was a big fan, President-elect Donald Trump may get his own audience with Queen Elizabeth II.The British government says it is considering inviting Trump for a state visit in 2017 as Prime Minister Theresa May works to cement the \"special relationship\" between the two countries.According to the London Times, the two leaders had a 10-minute telephone conversation after Trump's election victory. He reportedly told May that his mother was a huge admirer of the Queen and that the UK was a \"very special place for me and my country.\"A spokeswoman for May told reporters that \"an invitation for a state visit is one of the things that is under consideration following the election of a new US president.\" Such a visit would typically involve a meeting with the Queen.Trump's mother was born on the Scottish Isle of Lewis in 1912. She left for the United States in 1930 to work as a domestic servant.Whether he will now receive the red carpet and golden carriage ride down the Mall remains to be confirmed, but the visit could lead some in the UK to soften their opposition to the President-elect.READ: Trump's Brexit-style win is bad news for BritainA number of UK politicians, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, were outspoken about Trump in the weeks and months before the election.He was labeled as a \"demagogue,\" \"buffoon\" and \"wazzcock,\" and some members of Parliament debated banning Trump from the UK for his stance on preventing Muslims from entering the US.Trump's main ally in the UK has been Nigel Farage, the acting leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party and the man behind the successful Brexit campaign.READ: Farage, Trump meeting \"very productive\"The two men met on November 12 in New York, where Farage claimed that Trump's \"support for the US-UK relationship is very strong.\" Farage, who has been effusive in his praise of Trump, introduced him at a rally in Mississippi in August and later worked in the spin room as a surrogate after the second presidential debate in October.Trump made frequent references to Brexit throughout the campaign, saying it demonstrated the wish for change among voters frustrated with establishment politics.READ: Trump predicted 'Brexit plus plus plus,' and he was rightMany in the UK also hope Trump is more receptive about Brexit than current President Barack Obama.Obama, spoke out against Britain leaving the European Union in April, warning that a post-Brexit UK would be at the \"back of the queue\" in any trade deal with the US.The outgoing President, who made five official visits to the UK during his tenure, first met the Queen in April 2009.On that occasion, first lady Michelle Obama caused a sensation after breaking royal protocol and hugging the monarch.The relationship between the Obama's and royal family has been one of mutual admiration.Earlier this year, President Obama described the Queen as \"truly one of my favorite people.\" ","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/queen-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Donald Trump disavows 'alt-right'","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump denied Tuesday that he did anything to energize the \"alt-right\" movement through his presidential campaign and sought to distance himself from it, even though many of the movement's leaders have sought to tether their political views to Trump's rise.\"I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\" Trump told a group of New York Times reporters and columnists during a meeting at the newspaper's headquarters in New York.\"It's not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why,\" he added, according to one of the Times reporters in the room, Michael Grynbaum.Trump offered up the condemnation of the alt-right, a far-right political movement rife with white nationalist, anti-Semitic and racist ideologies, after The New York Times' executive editor Dean Baquet asked Trump if he feels he did things to energize the alt-right.Trump's comments come days after Richard Spencer, a white supremacist and leading figure in the alt-right, delivered a racist and anti-Semitic address to a gathering of the group's members in which he declared, emphatically, \"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\"Spencer's chants prompted some audience members to raise their right hand in an apparent Nazi salute.White supremacists have consistently expressed their support for Trump during the presidential campaign -- pointing in part to his hardline positions on immigration -- and critics contended that Trump was too slow to reject the support of those groups during his campaign.Trump also took flak recently after he tapped his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be one of his top two advisers in the White House. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, touted the website as \"the platform for the alt-right.\" Bannon rejected the anti-Semitic and racist elements of the alt-right in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week and declared himself an \"economic nationalist.\"Trump defended Bannon in his New York Times meeting, saying that he's known him for \"a long time\" and that the allegations of anti-Semitism and connections to the alt-right are \"not him.\"\"If I thought he was racist, or 'alt-right' ...

{"_id":"Donald Trump meets with Al Gore on climate change","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump met on Monday with Al Gore -- one of the most vocal advocates of fighting climate change. Before the meeting, Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on a daily briefing call that Gore would meet with Ivanka Trump, the President-elect's daughter, about climate issues, but he did not know what specifically was on the agenda. He had also said the former Democratic vice president would not meet with Trump himself.But Gore told reporters after the meeting that he met with Trump himself after seeing Ivanka. \"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the President-elect,\" Gore said, according to the pool report. \"It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the President-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that.\" Many Republicans are critical of the strong scientific consensus that human activities are exacerbating global climate change, potentially threatening millions of people and their ways of life. Gore has been one of the most outspoken advocates for raising awareness about the dangers of climate change since leaving the White House. Trump has been skeptical of climate change, tweeting in 2012 that global warming was \"created\" by the Chinese. He also called it a \"hoax\" in several public statements and in a 2014 tweet about a cold winter. He denied saying global warming was a Chinese hoax in a debate during the election, though the tweets have remained up, and he has appeared to adopt a different position after his election. The President-elect told The New York Times in an interview after the election, \"I think there is some connectivity,\" when asked about the role that carbon dioxide produced by humans plays in climate change. Trump admits 'some connectivity' on climate changeIvanka Trump is expected to take a policy role in her father's presidency, and has supported ideas that are sometimes at odds with some Republican policy positions. During the campaign, Ivanka spoke in favor of a plan to support paid maternity leave and child care costs that became part of Trump's platform.  Miller did not have specifics on what Ivanka's role in the White House would be on Monday, but said the family is \"completely supportive\" of what the President-elect is doing in terms of his transition planning, and is \"looking to help out in any capacity they can.\"The Trump children's involvement in their father's presidency has been under increased scrutiny given their extensive jobs in his business ventures. He has said he would resolve potential conflicts of interest as President by having his children run his organization and has a press conference scheduled Dec. 15 to discuss his plans.  In other Trump Tower meetings, the President-elect will meet with Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser on Tuesday in New York.

{"_id":"Donald Trump outlines policy plan for first 100 days ","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump unveiled plans Monday for his first 100 days in office, including proposals related to immigration, trade deals and defense policy, using a video published online to briefly outline his proposals.Trump promised to withdraw from negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, cancel environmental restrictions put in place by President Barack Obama, ask his national security team to buttress against infrastructure attacks, have the Labor Department investigate federal worker visas and impose broad new bans on lobbying by government employees. The six items Trump detailed Monday are all somewhat easy lifts inside Washington -- because they can be done with a simple signature by Trump and do not require congressional approval. But Trump also left out his biggest campaign promises -- including promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, establish a \"deportation force,\" place new restrictions on immigration from some majority Muslim countries, repeal Obamacare and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. Unlike his items unveiled Monday, those measures would require the approval of Congress and are likely to take significantly more work. Time and speed are very likely to be key factors as the new president looks for bigger, more durable wins in his first year. Republicans control the House and Senate, as well as the White House -- but Democrats struggled to pass key items, like Obamacare, when they were in a similar position eight years ago.Republicans hold a firm majority in the House, but could struggle in the Senate, where Democrats will hold 48 seats next year, enough to blockade Trump measures.Trump cast his measures as completely focused on American workers. \"Whether it's producing steel, building cars, or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, in our great homeland: America -- creating wealth and jobs for American workers,\" Trump said in the two-and-a-half-minute video statement.  \"As part of this plan, I've asked my transition team to develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs.\"Among his first actions, the Republican said he would \"issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the Transpacific Partnership\" and replace it with negotiating \"fair bilateral trade deals.\" Trump campaigned on a promise to halt the progress of the TPP trade deal, an agreement President Barack Obama had hoped would be a part of his administration's trade legacy. On immigration, Trump promised to \"investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker,\" but did not mention his signature campaign promise of building a wall along the US border with Mexico. The items are all measures he broadly campaigned on, though Trump has begun moderating some of the toughest stances he took on the campaign trail. In an interview with \"60 Minutes,\" he said that he would likely keep key portions of Obamacare. And not long after his election win, his campaign took down the web page with his earlier promise to ban all Muslims from entering the country -- he has since moderated that view greatly, but left major questions on how precisely he would limit immigration.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/donald-trump-outlines-policy-plan-for-first-100-days/index.html"}

He will use the North Carolina event to formally announced retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his choice to run the Pentagon.Trump previewed the announcement during a rally last week in Ohio. Trump is set to formally announce retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is his choice to run the Department of Defense though the President-elect preempted this week's announcement with his last tour stop in Cincinatti, Ohio last week.\"We are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis as our secretary of defense,\" Trump said at the rally, joking with the crowd, \"We're not announcing it until Monday -- so don't tell anybody.

While some of Trump's later events featured a teleprompter and scripted remarks, the Republican presidential nominee often engaged in unscripted moments to weigh in on news of the day and interact with audience members.

{"_id":"Donald Trump taps hardliners for national security team","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday three key members of the national security team for his administration -- signaling he will make good on the hard-line agenda on which he campaigned.Unveiled Friday were nominations of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor. Sessions and Pompeo would be subject to Senate confirmation, while the position of national security advisor is not. All three men take an uncompromising approach to national security and differ sharply from the Obama administration's doctrine. The trio indicate that Trump intends to stand by some of his more controversial national security positions from his campaign, rather than appointing more moderate-leaning candidates. Sessions is most known for his tough stance on immigration, much like Trump, and backed the Republican presidential nominee's proposal early in the campaign to temporary block all foreign Muslims from entering the US -- a position Trump has since walked back.Flynn has a reputation for a fiery temperament and has courted controversy with his strident positions on Islam and terrorism, as well as his penchant for sending out conspiracist tweets.Pompeo, who was not a Trump supporter during the primary, co-authored an \"additional views\" report to the Benghazi Committee's report on its investigation into the diplomatic mission attack in Benghazi, believing the Republican-led committee's report was not hard enough on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. Who could serve in Trump's Cabinet?Despite Trump's anti-Beltway \"drain the swamp\" pledge, all three candidates have or have had official positions in Washington. Flynn, who was pushed out of the Defense Department in 2014, runs a firm that does lobbying. And Sessions and Pompeo come directly from Congress, which has a near-historic low approval rating. But the trio have also served as thorns in their party's side at times. Flynn was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for his contentious management style, according to US officials, though he says it was because he raised warnings about Islamic terrorism. Sessions was a leader of the opposition to the ill-fated Gang of Eight immigration reform compromise bill negotiated by his more moderate Republican colleagues and Senate Democrats. That bill passed through the Senate, but ultimately died in the House. And Pompeo pushed for more strident findings on the Benghazi Committee, which was already widely criticized by Democrats as being a politically motivated witch hunt against Hillary Clinton.In fact, Pompeo, Sessions and Flynn have been some of the toughest members of their party on Clinton's use of a private email server, with Flynn leading \"lock her up\" chants at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer and Sessions criticizing the handling of her investigation by FBI Director James Comey.As attorney general, Sessions would be ultimately in charge of the prosecutorial decisions made on investigations like the one Comey oversaw on Clinton -- and could clash with the bureau director, who is serving a 10-year term. Trump has pledged to have a special prosecutor investigate Clinton, though he has hedged on whether he will pursue that since being elected. The move to reinforce Trump's tough campaign rhetoric with his nominees comes as his transition organization has made an effort to portray the President-elect as courting moderates for other positions in the administration -- including publicizing meetings with former critics South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, both on the topic of secretary of state. But so far with the exception of GOP Chairman Reince Priebus being named chief of staff, he has drawn from outside the establishment for his Cabinet and advisers.   Flynn's son, chief of staff pushed conspiracy theories onlineHard-line positionsSessions, Pompeo and Flynn all have taken strong positions on hot-button issues.Flynn is especially critical of Islamic terror, including a vocal twitter feed on which he has written \"fear of Muslims is rational.\" Sessions also defended Trump when he called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" temporarily in the face of terrorism.Trump has since walked back that position, most recently saying he will pursue a policy similar to after September 11 that requires immigrants from high-risk countries, most of which are Muslim-majority nations, to register in a tracking system.Flynn has also been criticized for his closeness to Russia, including appearing on a Russian television network and sitting alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner celebrating the network, RT. But he has said he didn't take money directly from Russia for his appearance and said he went to tell the Russians to crack down on Iran's involvement in Middle East conflicts. Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismThe willingness to engage with Russia corresponds with Trump's own positions, which drew criticism during the campaign. Trump has repeatedly expressed respect and admiration for Putin, and said he would look to work with Moscow as President.In addition to his tough position on Clinton's responsibility for the Benghazi attacks, Pompeo has advocated for strengthening the American surveillance apparatus again, calling for the restoration of surveillance powers that were curtailed in bipartisan reforms after the disclosures of Edward Snowden. \"Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed,\" he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.  National security experienceFriday's picks come from a variety of backgrounds and have different levels of experience on issues related to foreign policy, national security and intelligence.Flynn is a former defense intelligence chief and retired lieutenant general, bringing hefty national security experience to the table. But he has also drawn criticism from within defense community ranks for his management style and for his tendency to espouse positions that are outside of mainstream intelligence and defense thinking.Sessions, who would oversee both a domestic and national security portfolio at the Justice Department, has a long legal career with experience as his state's attorney general and as a prosecutor. In the Senate he served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Pompeo is a graduate of West Point and a veteran of the Army. He has a law degree from Harvard, founded an aerospace company and managed an oilfield service and manufacturing company before joining the House, where he serves on the House Intelligence Committee. While Pompeo has been active on issues of intelligence, he has no experience from within the actual intelligence community agencies, leaving Flynn as the most experienced member of Trump's team on national security and intelligence. Trump has not yet indicated who he will pick for other key national security posts, including at the Pentagon and to be the Director of National Intelligence.Flynn will have Trump's ear as his close adviser and will be close to the President-elect in the White House, making it likely that he will have a strong influence over the whole administration's posture.Flynn picked for national security advisorCNN's Barbara Starr, Ryan Browne, Deirdre Walsh, Elise Labott, Jim Acosta, Evan Perez and Eric Brander contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Donald Trump's Cabinet picks: What we've learned so far","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump has begun assembling his administration -- the country's first indication of how he will govern from the White House. Trump is not expected to name any additional Cabinet picks over the holiday weekend, but has made some preliminary selections in the few weeks since the election.Declared intended nominees include Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for ambassador to the UN, and Republican donor and school choice activist Betsy DeVos for education secretary. Trump has also named retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn his national security adviser in the White House, a position that doesn't need Senate confirmation.There are also leading contenders for other roles, including billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary, Chicago Cubs co-owner and Republican donor Todd Ricketts for deputy commerce secretary, Trump fundraiser and finance executive Steve Mnuchin, retired Gen. James Mattis for defense secretary and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to lead Housing and Urban Development. Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is also in the running to be secretary of state, as is former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Here are five things we've learned from Trump's selections and top choices.Cubs owner likely to be tapped for commerce deputyFormer rivals welcomeWhile he was known to engage in bitter fights with his critics during the campaign, Trump has signaled that he's willing to welcome one-time sparring partners into the fold. The announcement of Haley to Trump's administration was a surprise. Haley endorsed Trump's former opponent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, during the presidential primary, and spoke out forcefully against Trump until he became the nominee. While Haley said she would vote for Trump as the nominee, in public she wasn't a strong booster of his White House bid.Trump is also said to be seriously considering nominating Romney, who never endorsed Trump before the election, saying over the summer he wouldn't serve in a Trump administration and warning of the potential for \"trickle-down racism.\"Ricketts is also likely to be named to a deputy post in the Commerce Department. His wealthy family heavily invested in efforts to stop Trump's path to the nomination, though they changed course and spent hefty sums in Trump's favor late in the election. Trump looks to former critics for top jobsRewarding GOP donors and loyalistsMuch like past presidents, Trump has moved to reward the party's donor base with plum posts in the administration. DeVos is a billionaire Republican donor who has been active on school choice issues as well as promoting charter schools. She chairs the American Federation for Children, which promotes charter school education, and also served on the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group led by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, which promoted both school choice and the Common Core education standards, though DeVos has said since being named that she does not support Common Core. During the 2016 primary, she gave to a super PAC supporting Rubio. Ricketts, his parents and brother are also sizable Republican donors, creating a super PAC to support Trump in the latter part of the campaign, and Ross is a big-pocketed donor who gave generously to the Republican National Committee this cycle. Trump has also leaned heavily on his loyalists throughout the campaign to build his incoming administration. Some of his first selections were Sessions and Flynn, two men who endorsed Trump and began advising him very early in his campaign.Other Trump surrogates and supporters under consideration for Cabinet positions include Carson, Giuliani, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, though Gingrich has said he prefers a senior planning role over a Cabinet post. It's a pattern being repeated in Trump's budding White House team, where he has already tapped RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and campaign executive Steve Bannon as a senior adviser. Other campaign staffers are expected to get White House staff positions, if they want them, as well.  DeVos picked for education secretaryNot all white menWhile Trump's first few picks, including Sessions, Flynn and Pompeo plus his White House team, were all white men, Trump has since moved to add more diversity to his Cabinet.DeVos and Haley are both women, and Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants to the United States. If Carson decides to serve in the administration -- the retired neurosurgeon says an offer is on the table -- he would also bring diversity to the Cabinet as an African-American.Trump has faced criticism throughout his candidacy and since the election for being perceived as stoking racist and anti-immigrant sentiments in the US. His election has been lauded by anti-Semitic and racist groups, including a gathering of white supremacists in Washington, DC, which was recorded giving the Nazi salute during a speech hailing Trump.The President-elect has said he does not embrace their support, however, and has pledged to work as President for different groups of Americans.  Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Dissenting viewsTrump is said to be weighing Giuliani or Romney for secretary of state, which is causing dissent within his own ranks. Romney remains popular with Republicans and both Trump and Romney spoke positively of a meeting the two had over the weekend. But other Trump supporters like Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee have spoken out against Romney as a possible selection.On Thursday, Trump's campaign manager and close adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted two messages interpreted as digs at Romney.\"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state,\" she tweeted, with a link to a Politico article about discontent with the 2012 nominee. \"Kissinger & Schultz as Secs of State flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist,\" she followed. A lack of foreign policy experience is a criticism of both Romney and Giuliani as candidates for the post. Conway told CNN that she was not trying to send a message to Trump, but did say there was concern about Romney.\"I am struck by the intensity and volume of resistance (to Romney) from the grassroots; words like 'betrayal.' I communicate with PEOTUS and VPEOTUS privately and regularly so this is not an attempt to do so publicly as some (who missed the election completely) are suggesting,\" Conway said in a message to CNN. Pulling from in and out of The BeltwaySo far, Trump has made good on what his pre-election transition team said in DC meetings with industry and policy specialists: His Cabinet has drawn from inside and outside of Washington. Pompeo, Flynn and Sessions are all well-known in Washington, as would be Mattis, with Pompeo and Sessions being sitting members of Congress. But Trump has also drawn from state politics, pulling Haley from the South Carolina Governor's Mansion and DeVos from Michigan, where she was previously a state party chairwoman in addition to her activism. If the President-elect follows through on Ricketts, Mnuchin and Ross, as well, he would be drawing from the private sector, especially the world of finance and investing.   Trump ran on an outsider campaign, pledging to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, though his transition team has been staffed with many current DC policy staffers and former lobbyists. Members of the transition team were asked to terminate their lobbying registrations to stay on staff after Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over the team.

{"_id":"Dressed to kill: How the military invaded our closets ","articleText":"Timothy Godbold is a fashion journalist and author. This is an edited excerpt from his latest book, \"Military Style Invades Fashion,\" published by Phaidon.  (CNN)Once you begin to notice the extent to which military styles have influenced fashion, it's impossible to ignore it. Militaria is unmistakable and it is everywhere: worn by men, women and children across the globe.From high fashion to thrift-store chic, military appropriations are ubiquitous. Luxury fashion houses have long borrowed elements of both ceremonial swagger and utilitarianism from the style sheet of military uniform. In the 1960s, Yves Saint Laurent designed his famous pea coats, igniting a trend for exquisite military-inspired clothing and coats soon followed by designers including Dries Van Noten, Balmain and Givenchy, among many others. Read: Stephen Jones on how to choose the perfect hatAccessories have also benefited from similar inspiration, evidenced by Tom Ford's aviator sunglasses and Louis Vuitton handbags and luggage. At the other end of the fashion scale, in the 1960s, hippies wore cargo pants and army jackets as political statements. Now camouflage prints are visible on anything from Nike athletic shoes to bandages and sticking plasters for children. The military influence even goes beyond clothes to interior design, seen in campaign chairs with leather straps and austere lines, to portable Hermes desks.The genius of military design I remember my father's wardrobe in the spare room at home, where his army uniform hung neatly next to his crested blazer from Trinity College, Melbourne. This wardrobe was a constant fascination to me growing up for the way in which its contents represented power, intellect and sophistication. Read: Inside the world's sexiest subculturesI noticed the nuances of clothing and how what we wear affects how we feel and behave. I also noticed how costumes functioned in movies -- how often, for example, the villains' frightening outfits were derived from extreme military looks, such as those of the SS or the Gestapo. I saw how rock musicians, from the Beatles to Duran Duran and beyond, referenced military clothing in their stage costumes and on their album covers.Read: Meet Katie Grand, the fashion industry's secret weaponI once came across a photograph of Lord Albert Victor in full military regalia. The striking blue and the encrusted gold and silver used in the trimmings and sashes were strong and imperial. They were powerful evidence of the genius that underlay military design. Then I caught sight of myself in a mirror. Following men's fashion that year, I was dressed in fatigue cargo pants tucked into leather boots and a loden green sweater. My hair was slicked back as severely as if I had just stepped out of a plane after flying a bombing mission in World War II. I laughed at myself, of course, but the echoes between the photograph and my own clothes made me determined to explore further. Where does our fascination with military style come from and how far will we take it in the name of fashion? Read: Tiffany & Co's rare bejeweled show gunsThis book looks at types of military style and how they have been absorbed into the mainstream of fashion. Each chapter reveals a different visual aspect of the military style vocabulary, celebrating its widespread appeal. In other words why, as the cultural critic Troy Patterson observed recently in The New York Times, 'half the people you see on the street are dressed to kill.'\"Military Style Invades Fashion,\" published by Phaidon, is out now.

{"_id":"Driving While Distracted: Why can't we ignore the pings?","articleText":"Check out the weeklong series \"DWD: Driving While Distracted\" online and tune in to the TV special on CNNgo. (CNN)Most people will admit that texting, checking social media or playing a video game while driving isn't safe, and yet, some still do it. Why?David Greenfield, founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, says it has to do with the addictive nature of smartphones and how our brain instinctively responds to those pings, which signal an incoming text or social media update. Consider the case of Laura Maurer, an Iowa mother of two who pulled over to text a client and then pulled back onto the road. She tried to ignore the ping alerting her to an incoming text but ultimately couldn't resist it. By glancing at her phone, she ended up killing a 75-year-old farmer and grandfather on a tractor.\"The reason why she answered that ping is because ... she felt compulsed or felt a compulsion in order to answer it,\" said Greenfield, who is also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry for the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.Our smartphones are affecting our brains without us even being aware of it. When we hear the ping of an incoming text, social media update or email, our brains get a hit of dopamine, a chemical that leads to an increase in arousal, energizing the reward circuitry in our brains. And that expectation of a reward -- Who's texting me? Who tagged me on social media? -- leads to a higher burst of dopamine than the reward itself.\"The dopamine reward centers are the same centers that have to do with pleasure from eating, pleasure from sex and procreation, pleasure from drugs and alcohol,\" Greenfield said. \"This reward circuitry is (as) old as time and if we didn't have it, we probably wouldn't exist as a species.\"When our brains are in that elevated dopamine state caused by the expectation of a text or status update, the activated brain reward center does something else. It shuts down access to another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, where most of our judgment and reasoning occurs.\"The parts of the brain that say, 'OK, how important is this text? Is this text worth dying for? Is this text worth killing somebody else for?' \" Greenfield said. \"The answer, of course, logically, would be 'no,' but if you have less access to that part of your brain when you're in this state, which seems to be the case, then you're not really using your judgment.\"'I know I shouldn't be eating potato chips'Scott Tibbitts is an entrepreneur and founder of a technology called Groove, which he believes can help bring an end to distracted driving. Groove sends a signal to your mobile phone provider, alerting it to hold all texts and social media updates while you are driving, and prevents you from texting or posting on social media until your car is no longer moving.He compares the lure of the smartphone to having an open bag of potato chips in the car.\"I know I shouldn't be eating potato chips, but just take a deep breath of that barbecue sauce,\" said Tibbitts, founder and chief executive officer of the Colorado-based startup Katasi. \"Well, that's what the 'bing' is. The 'bing' is 'Oh, my gosh, this might be the text message from my daughter that says, \"Dad, I need help,\" ' or from my wife saying I've got to get home, or from the business saying, 'Call this person right away.' And if that 'bing' happens, it is extraordinarily hard even for me to not want to just take a quick peek at the next stop light,\" he said. \"It's a powerful force.\"Our brains also have a way of fooling us. Every time we look at social media or text or do anything else while behind the wheel and nothing bad happens, we think we will be safe if we do it again.Think about it along the lines of reinforcement theory, said Despina Stavrinos, director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's distracted driving research lab. \"So you're driving every day, sending text messages, and nothing happens. So it's reinforcing to you, 'Hey, I can do this. I am a pretty good multitasker,' \" said Stavrinos, who is also an assistant professor in the school's department of psychology. \"The problem is again (if) some unexpected hazard pops up and you're not able to respond appropriately, it could be fatal.\"'Multitasking is an illusion'While it may seem safer, using a phone hands-free can be just as dangerous. Using a handheld or hands-free device while driving, according to a study by the University of Utah (PDF), resulted in a slower reaction time than if you were legally drunk.\"Multitasking is an illusion,\" said Greenfield, of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction. \"There have been numerous studies that have proven that this whole concept of multitasking is really a bit of an illusion. ... You really can't attend to things ... at multiple times.\"What's still hard to completely grasp is how so many of us do something so easily that we know is dangerous. In a 2013 survey of more than 1,000 adult drivers that was sponsored by AT&T, nearly all -- 98% -- said they know that texting while driving is wrong, but almost half admitted to doing it. \"Why would you put something down that's pleasurable?\" Greenfield asked. \"Why would you not do something that lights up a part of your brain that's similar to when you have sex?\"Willpower alone won't solve the problem, he says. It's the same as being on a diet and trying to avoid eating that piece of cake. Eventually, you will eat that cake, but in the case of distracted driving, one \"bite\" could be deadly.\"Because of the addictive nature of all of these things, people lack the self-control,\" said Jennifer Smith, a mother of two who lost her own mother to a distracted driver in 2008. \"I don't know what the answer is, because our brain is craving this. Our brain is wanting this more than anything else, and it just disregards everything we know.\"It's like we need a mass education campaign, but I don't even think that's enough to beat out this reward system we're getting in our brain when we're like, 'Ooh, something's going on. I want to see what it is,' \" said Smith, who founded the advocacy group StopDistractions.org.Greenfield's message? \"You gotta know that it's bigger than you. That's really the bottom line,\" he said. \"We like to think we're the master of our destiny. ... That's not true.\"Coming Thursday: Could technology, which caused the problem, provide the ultimate solution?Can you ignore the pings on your phone when you are driving?

{"_id":"Dubai: Alleged rape involving British nationals was consensual","articleText":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)A rape investigation involving a British national allegedly assaulted in Dubai has been closed after a prosecutor concluded the sex was consensual. But officials did not explicitly say what happens to the charge against the woman, who was arrested and accused of extramarital sex, despite her accusations of rape.The Dubai Media Office did say Tuesday that the woman and the two men accused -- also British nationals -- \"are in the process of receiving their passports and are free to leave the UAE.\"\"A thorough review of statements given by the British woman and the two suspects as well as the reports of investigating officers from Dubai police showed that the act happened with the consent of the three parties in question,\" the Dubai Media Office said, citing the public prosecutor's office.  \"A video obtained from the mobile phone of one of the suspects detailing the act was a key evidence that supported this conclusion.\"The allegationsAccording to Detained in Dubai, a UK-based legal advice group, the woman was gang-raped by British nationals.\"The victim reported the rape to police and was promptly arrested herself on charges of having extramarital intercourse,\" the group said. If convicted of consensual extramarital sex, a defendant can face anywhere from a month to three years behind bars, followed by deportation, said attorney Faisal Alzarooni, who represents clients who have been charged with both rape and consensual sex in Dubai.Dubai is one of seven emirates that comprise the United Arab Emirates, or UAE.\"The UAE has a long history of penalizing rape victims,\" said Radha Stirling, founder and director of Detained in Dubai. \"It is still not safe for victims to report these crimes to the police without the risk of suffering a double punishment.\"But the statement from Dubai officials said authorities take rape allegations seriously. \"Dubai's legal system takes reports of all crimes very seriously, including and especially violence against women, and conducts thorough investigations of all incidents,\" it said.

{"_id":"Dunkin' Donuts' menu, as curated by a nutritionist","articleText":" (CNN)Is it possible to eat something healthy at a fast food chain such as Dunkin' Donuts?It's challenging but doable. With some careful thought and menu research (Dunkin's website is very user-friendly and includes a section of menu options that have fewer than 400 calories), you can enjoy a portion-controlled meal that's relatively nutritious, portable and not too costly.The chain's beverages are another story, outside of black coffee and low-fat lattes, which provide an impressive amount of bone-building calcium; both are a healthy addition to any meal. But Dunkin's flavored and frozen beverages are packed with added sugars, contributing empty calories and increasing the risk of weight gain. Recent research suggests that added sugars may independently increase heart disease risk too, possibly by increasing LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol, or blood pressure. Even a healthy ingredient such as skim milk won't do much to negate the 70 grams of sugar in a large Butter Pecan Swirl Hot Macchiato, for example. That's almost three days' worth of sugar for women and two days' worth for men, according to the American Heart Association's sugar guidelines -- all in one beverage. (The association recommends a limit of 6 teaspoons, or 24 grams of added sugars for women, and 9 teaspoons, or 36 grams for men). The large Frozen Coffee Coolatta has 86 grams!If you want to splurge on a sugary drink, go for the smallest size. The small (10-ounce) original hot chocolate has less than half the calories and sugar compared with the large (24-ounce) cup.One more note of caution: Don't fall for the description \"reduced.\" Dunkin's reduced-fat blueberry muffin is the lowest in fat out of all of the muffins, but it's still comparable to eating a piece of cake. The muffin has 410 calories and 40 grams of sugar. Similarly, the ham, egg and cheese on English muffin has less than half the amount of calories, saturated fat and sugar compared with the sausage, egg and cheese on croissant, but it still has 740 milligrams of sodium, which is a high for those who are watching their salt intake.Here are the best Dunkin' Donut options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by good choices for children, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options.  For childrenOur picks: Old fashioned, powdered and cinnamon Munchkins; bowtie, Apple n Spice, cinnamon guava, glazed, jelly and sugared raised doughnuts; Original Hot ChocolateWe know that when kids stop by Dunkin' Donuts, it's typically not for a breakfast sandwich or coffee. But whether it's for an after-school snack or a birthday party, there are healthier doughnut and Munchkin options.Since Munchkins are naturally portion-controlled, none is going to break the kiddie calorie bank (not even the glazed chocolate one). That said, the lowest-calorie (60) and saturated fat (1.5 grams) Munchkins are the old fashioned, powdered and cinnamon.When it comes to doughnuts, better options include the bowtie (lowest in saturated fat); the Apple n Spice, the cinnamon guava, glazed, jelly and the sugared raised doughnut (lowest in calories). If your child wants hot chocolate, stick with a small cup, which has the least amount of sugar (30 grams) and calories (220), though that is still rather high.  For vegetariansOur picks: Original oatmeal with dried fruit topping; egg and cheese on English muffin; multigrain bagel; latte with skim or almond milkAlthough the doughnuts and Munchkins are made with vegetable oils and therefore vegetarian (but not vegan), healthier meat-free options are available. For good doses of protein and fiber while relatively low in saturated fat and sodium, stick with the oatmeal with dried fruit or the egg and cheese on English muffin.If you also avoid eggs or dairy, then doughnuts are out, but the multigrain bagel delivers 15 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber from a combination of whole-wheat flour, sunflower seeds and flax seeds. It's also the lowest-sodium bagel offered. Add a latte with skim or almond milk, depending on your diet preference.For vegansOur picks: English muffin; multigrain bagel; latte with almond milk.For strict vegans, a solid breakfast option is the English muffin, which will give you a morning fiber boost. If you don't restrict honey in your vegan nutrition plan, the multigrain bagel is in. Add a latte with almond milk for extra calcium.For calorie countersOur picks: Egg and cheese Wake-Up Wrap; latte with skim milkWho says you can't be a dieter and dine at Dunkin' Donuts? The egg and cheese Wake-Up Wrap has only 150 calories and provides 7 grams of satiating protein. Pair it with a small skim latte, and you'll just about double the protein and more than triple your calcium intake, which will help your bones and your waistline too, according to research.For the sugar-sensitiveOur picks: Egg white veggie Wake-Up Wrap; coffee with skim milkThe egg white veggie wrap has 1 gram (or a quarter-teaspoon) of sugar. This trace amount will barely make a dent in your daily sugar budget.Again, some of the beverages at Dunkin' Donuts contain well over a day's worth of sugar. The large Vanilla Bean Coolatta has a whopping 174 grams: For a woman, that's a week's worth of added sugars. Even an innocent-sounding latte with skim milk packs 55 grams of sugar in the large size when you sweeten it with the real stuff (about 20 grams come naturally from milk), which is a lot more than a 12-ounce can of soda. Save the sugar for dessert and choose a plain coffee with skim milk.For the salt-sensitive Our picks: Original oatmeal with dried fruit topping; coffee with skim milkDunkin's original oatmeal not only provides heart-healthy soluble fiber, which helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels; it's also the lowest-sodium meal on Dunkin's menu besides the smoothies. If you can afford a few more milligrams, that allows the egg white veggie Wake-Up Wrap, at 380 milligrams.Coffee with skim milk gives a slight calcium boost with less sodium than a latte.For the gluten-sensitiveOur picks: Egg and cheese bagel (minus the bagel); strawberry banana smoothie (half portion).When you have a menu filled with doughnuts, Munchkins, muffins and bagels, forgoing gluten is no easy task. At the present time, Dunkin' does not have gluten-free menu items. The company says that it is continuing to develop and test gluten-free products and remains committed to exploring ways to offer guests these choices.So if you want to steer clear of gluten, your best bet is to order the egg and cheese \"bagel\" and skip the bagel part (no matter the weird look the server might give you). The strawberry banana smoothie is gluten-free, but you may want to split it with a friend to slash sugar calories.For the athleteOur picks: Original oatmeal with dried fruit topping; egg white veggie flatbread; iced latte with skim milkDunkin's original oatmeal is a power pre-workout meal. The 54 grams of carbs will supercharge your muscles (carbohydrates provide energy for muscles in the form of muscle glycogen and are especially important during intense workouts). And the tasty bites of dried cranberries and raisins boost the iron content of the meal.Since athletes require extra protein, we recommend pairing the porridge with a medium-sized iced latte. It's also a treat as a post-workout beverage.If you're looking for a mini-meal before a training session, the egg white veggie flatbread delivers protein to help repair and strengthen muscles.For the road warriorOur picks: Egg and cheese on English muffin; multigrain bagel with reduced-fat plain cream cheese; iced latte with skim milkThe egg and cheese on English muffin is one of the most nutritious meals you'll find on Dunkin's menu. It's balanced with a healthy mix of protein, carbohydrates and fiber, which will give you sustained energy on the road, and it's relatively low in saturated fat and sodium.The multigrain bagel is another option, especially since it's so transportable. Just watch the cream cheese, which contributes unhealthy saturated fat. Choose the reduced-fat spread if a plain bagel won't satisfy.For a beverage, a small iced latte with skim milk is easy to sip while driving.For the carb-consciousOur picks: Egg and cheese Wake-Up Wrap; green teaAfter passing up all of the doughnuts, bagels and Munchkins, a lower-carbohydrate meal at Dunkin' Donuts sounds harder to find than it is. The Wake-Up Wraps are a convenient way to get a healthy dose of protein for fewer carbs. The egg and cheese one has the lowest carb count, at 13 grams.Note that the turkey sausage wrap and the Angus steak and egg wrap also have 13 grams of carbs and more protein, but they also have more saturated fat and sodium.Add a cup of green tea for an antioxidant-rich caffeine boost without any carbs.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/health/dunkin-donuts-menu-nutritionist/index.html"}

{"_id":"Dying in the desert: The villagers trapped in no-man's land","articleText":" (CNN)On a barren patch of desert in northern Iraq, Abu Tiba and hundreds of other civilians wait for the torment to end.  The freezing nights, the food shortages and -- worst of all -- the mortars and artillery shells that land with terrifying regularity on this area of desert, which is a temporary home to sheep and cattle herders. \"Yesterday a mortar attack killed a baby in his crib,\" says Abu Tiba. \"And they couldn't transfer the mother to a hospital so she died too.\"As the battle against ISIS in Mosul and the outskirts intensified, Abu Tiba, his family, friends and around 1,800 other civilians fled the small village of Kirfouk, north of the city. They were told to leave their homes by the Kurdish Peshmerga, for their own safety.Now they are caught in no man's land in the middle of the fighting between the Peshmerga and ISIS, in an area called Wadi Alahmar.Dying of cold\"The situation is really bad,\" says Abu Tiba.\"We are in the open air, in the cold, and we are all families with kids. People are tired.  We just received aid, but we are suffering from the cold, winter is coming and people are getting sick -- kids have died from the cold and there have been miscarriages as well.\"CNN tried to visit to see the situation for ourselves, but the battlefield was simply too dangerous.Instead workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross supplied us with video and interviews when they risked their lives to deliver crucial aid supplies.    \"The trip wasn't easy,\" the ICRC'S Amro Ibrahim says, but after coordinating with the Peshmerga they managed to bring three trucks full of food and other supplies in.Ibrahim says they delivered enough aid for 300 families for one month.Their cattle are their livesThis bizarre situation emerged because so many of the people of Kirfouk are sheep and cattle herders. When given the option to go to camps for internally displaced people, some felt that they couldn't leave their livelihood behind, and so they stayed despite the danger. \"We are shepherds, we have cattle, and we remained in the outskirts of the province even under these circumstances,\" Sheikh Mohammed Younis Ali explains. \"And so we move around with our cattle as it's our only source of income\".  Peshmerga fighters say they're doing what they can to protect the people but it's difficult given the ongoing battles with ISIS.  Initially, they say they provided aid, until the ICRC stepped in to help.Dangerous delivery of aid\"At the moment we cannot let them cross the area to the villages, but whatever they need, we try to provide it to them,\" says Major Jaafar Mustafa, a brigade assistant commander.\"Today the ICRC brought for them food and other things, and the people were very happy with these efforts\".The dangerous delivery of aid is all they have on which to survive: rice, sugar, lentils, tea -- even shaving kits and shampoo.The people of Kirfouk are trying to keep away from the fighting as much as they can, moving around the area between the lines -- but it's difficult. Battles have intensified, and their village is still deemed too unsafe to return to.Um Ali told of the conditions she and her family lived through in Kirfouk even before fleeing to the desert.\"We stayed and endured the shelling, we suffered a lot, and our kids remained without schools,\" she says.\"We stayed till the end because they told us to remain in our houses and we listened to the government.\"Sleeping on the sandNow, she says, life is even worse.  \"We sleep on the sand at night - how can you expect us to rest?\" she asks. \"Look at our kids - how they look. My son got a fever from the cold - of course he's sleeping on the ground - and we had a child  who died from the cold.\"Yesterday we were hit by a mortar and one lady and her husband died while they transferred their son to Irbil for treatment.\"What will become of the hundreds of families here, trying to survive, will depend on what happens on the battlefront.So far, the death toll is approximate, certainly more than half a dozen people, according to the ICRC -- both from exposure and shelling.The plight of the people of Kirfouk is yet another grim postcard of what the battle against ISIS is doing to the innocent.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/middleeast/mosul-trapped-herders/index.html"}
{"_id":"Dylan Jones: Could West Africa's style industry go global","articleText":"Dylan Jones is editor-in-chief of British GQ and the chairman of London Fashion Week Men's. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)We are always being told that West Africa is a coming thing in fashion. In the same way that people fell over themselves a decade ago trying to tell anyone who would listen that China was going to be the coming place for art. So, for the last few years we've been inundated with opinion pieces saying that in terms of style, Nigeria is about to go global.Read: The rising stars of a $31 billion industryHaving just returned from the GTBank Fashion Weekend I would say that they might actually be right. Held last weekend on Victoria Island in Lagos, the event was positioned as a way to encourage local businesses, helping them amplify their brands in the process. Unusually, it was also a B2C event, targeting consumers rather than retailers or wholesalers. I gave one of the masterclasses on Sunday afternoon, and the level of feedback and interaction was more than impressive. Often when I speak at similar events -- especially business schools -- the levels of engagement can be disappointing, but I immediately sensed that the people in the audience had actually come for practical business advice, and all had pertinent questions relating to their industries.  But it was the brands themselves that impressed me most, as well as the fact that a lot of the brands were aiming at the men's market, with a strong emphasis on tailoring. As the chairman of London Collections Men (which has now been rebranded Fashion Week Men's) I have already seen various Nigerian designers who have decided to show at London Fashion Week (the best of which I have to say is Orange Culture), but it was great to see so many young designers with a genuine sense of flair and originality. Fusion of sensibilitiesLagos is certainly no backwater in terms of upmarket consumer culture, and you only have to visit Alara, the extraordinary multi-brand store founded by Reni Folawiyo and designed by superstar architect David Adjaye to see that at its best, luxury lifestyle in Lagos is as sophisticated as it is in London, New York or Los Angeles. Alara stocks both Western brands and pan-African designs, and is a reflection of the way in which there has recently been a genuine fusion of African and European design sensibilities. WATCH: David Adjaye honored as new Smithsonian opensThis fusion could be seen at the Fashion Weekend, as you had fashion shows from the likes of British designer Julien Macdonald, as well as from local designers such as David Tlale and Taibo Bacar. I talked to Julien the day before his show, and he was blown away by the enormity of the project, and by the local team's attention to detail. \"It's one of the biggest shows I've ever done,\" he said, before rushing off to another rehearsal.Obviously Lagos has a long-standing history of fine men's tailoring, and this was in evidence throughout the weekend, not just on the catwalk and on the rails of the exhibitors, but also on the backs of the sharply dressed men who turned up to take selfies with each other. Most of the men I met were in related industries, and nearly all of them had bought their clothes locally.Sartorial rat packs?So while they may have looked as though they had spent inordinate amounts of time shopping in independent retailers in Williamsburg, Shoreditch, or Berlin, most items appeared to have originated (designed and produced) in Lagos. The styles themselves were largely a rather smart mix of the traditional and the contemporary, where for instance you would see a sharply cut two-piece suit (one you might see sported by the likes of Tinie Tempah, Kanye West or Justin Tiumberlake), but made from vibrant local fabrics. This was Savile Row tailoring with a twist, bespoke suits seen through the filter of modern Africa. Many of the suits also celebrated the mythic sartorial inventions of the Rat Pack.Global impact, via InstagramI was asked repeatedly how small tailoring businesses in the area could attract more attention, given that hardly any of them have marketing or publicity budgets; and my answers were based around social media. Given the way in which Instagram has taken over the world, and the way in which it has now got serious traction in the fashion, art and design micro-climates, it would be foolish not to use it as a marketing tool. Judging by the number of photographs taken over the weekend, and the thousands of pictures posted online, this is an opportunity that is already being exploited.In the West we still have a rather imperialistic view of the luxury goods industry, looking at every emerging market as a way of refreshing weak domestic sales. However, it is these very same emerging markets where a lot of the creativity and ingenuity is emerging from, and we should be more mindful of this.","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/fashion/lagos-fashion-weekend-gq/index.html"}

{"_id":"Dylann Roof represents self in Charleston murder trial","articleText":"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)A federal judge on Monday granted Dylann Roof's motion to represent himself, and Roof is being permitted to object if he feels potential jurors are not fit to serve on the jury deciding his fate. Roof, who is accused of killing nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, was deemed competent to stand trial last week.Jury selection had been under way when US District Judge Richard Mark Gergel halted the process to allow Roof to undergo a competency evaluation. Gergel ruled Roof was competent, but he sealed a document containing the reasons for his finding. Disclosing the document would jeopardize Roof's right to a fair trial, the judge said. The process of selecting a jury of Roof's peers resumed Monday. Federal court officials said 20 jurors were questioned during the deliberation, seven of those were found to be qualified and 13 jurors were excused. The court will continue questioning jurors until 70 qualified jurors are identified.  As trials coincide, Charleston prays for justiceAt least one possible juror was asked if a person should face the death penalty for taking another life. The judge eliminated one juror who answered the question by saying the punishment should fit the crime. Prosecutors and Roof agreed to the judge's move. Another juror was pressed on the matter after saying in her questionnaire, \"I'm Catholic, and I'm not sure I could decide on the death penalty.\" She told the judge during Monday's hearing that she had not followed the case so it was difficult for her to say what she would do theoretically. It would depend on \"the facts on hand,\" she said, before concluding she could not impose capital punishment. Gergel struck her without objection. Another juror was cut from the pool without objection after expressing opposition to imprisoning people for life without parole, because of the cost, while expressing support for the death penalty in murder cases.The judge also asked jurors if Roof's race or the race of the victims would affect their ability to be impartial. One potential juror said in a questionnaire that she was sickened by the thought of someone killing people in a church. The judge asked if this would affect her ability to be impartial and later ruled that she be nixed as a potential juror. Potential jurors are being asked to leave the courtroom if prosecutors or Roof state concerns about their qualifications. Roof, who had legal representation sitting with him in the courtroom, has not yet issued any objections. Roof faces 33 federal charges: nine counts of violating the Hate Crime Act resulting in death; three counts of violating the Hate Crime Act involving an attempt to kill; nine counts of obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death; three counts of obstruction of exercise of religion involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon; and nine counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.If convicted, he could face the death penalty.Roof also faces nine counts of murder and other charges in the state court system.

{"_id":"Earliest known stone version of Ten Commandments sold for $850,000","articleText":" (CNN)The earliest known stone inscription of the Ten Commandments sold for $850,000 -- and a stipulation the owner must put the tablet on public display.Described as a \"national treasure\" of Israel, the stone was first uncovered in 1913 during excavations for a railroad station near Yavneh in Israel and is the only intact tablet version of the Commandments thought to exist. \"The tablet's significance is testament to the deep roots and enduring power of the Commandments that still form the basis of three of the world's great religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam,\" said David Michaels, director of ancient coins for Heritage Auctions. \"Its surface is worn, battered and encrusted in places, but running a gloved finger over it does produce, in some people, a particular thrill of touching a piece of Bible history.\"Buried for centuriesThe two-foot-square (0.18 square meter), 115-pound (52 kg) marble slab is inscribed in an early Hebrew script called Samaritan and most likely adorned a Samaritan synagogue or home in the ancient town of Jabneel, Palestine, which is now Yavneh in modern Israel, according to Michaels. It lists nine of the 10 commonly known Biblical Commandments from the Book of Exodus, with an additional Commandment to worship on the sacred mountain of Mount Gerizim, near Nablus, which is a now a city in the West Bank. \"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in Vain\" was deliberately left off the list to keep the total number of Commandments to 10, according to scholars.Michaels said the the tablet's home was either destroyed by the Romans between 400 and 600 AD, or by the Crusaders in the 11th century, and that the stone had lain buried in the rubble of the ruins for centuries before its discovery near Yavneh. \"The workmen who found it did not recognize its importance and either sold or gave it to a local Arab man, who set the stone into the threshold of a room leading to his inner courtyard, with the inscription facing up,\" Michaels said. \"Some of the letters of the central part of the inscription are blurred -- but still readable under proper lighting -- either from the conditions of its burial or foot traffic while it was resting in the courtyard.\"Thirty years later, in 1943, the man's son sold the stone to Y. Kaplan, a municipal archaeologist. \"He immediately recognized its importance as an extremely rare 'Samaritan Decalogue,' one of five such known stone inscriptions that date to the late Roman-Byzantine era (300-640 CE) or just after the Muslim invasion of the seventh century CE,\" added Michaels. CE is a term used in academic texts and refers to \"Common Era\", which is more commonly known as AD.National treasureAfter recognizing its importance, Kaplan asked a noted archaeologist -- Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who would go on to become Israel's second-longest serving president -- to help him investigate its provenance. They published an academic paper that recounts the story of the stone's discovery and provides background information about its historical context.Kaplan eventually sold the stone to an American, Rabbi Saul Deutsch, who took it to the US and put it on display at his Living Torah Museum in Brooklyn, New York. Described as a \"National Treasure\" by Israel, its export was approved under a special permit issued in 2005 by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). \"It is significant in that it is the only such piece that has secure provenance, a 70-year history of study and scholarship by renowned specialists such as Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, and can now be legally obtained and kept outside of Israel, provided it is placed on public display as per the IAA's requirements,\" Michaels said. The IAA stipulated that the stone can be sold to a third party, but only on condition that it be placed on public display \"where all can view it and enjoy.\"Rabbi Deutsch put the stone up for sale, along with more than 50 other \"Bible-related historical artifacts\" he owns, to fund an expansion of his Living Torah Museum, according to Michaels.

Like many of us, Gwynne was out last weekend to capture the moon in all its glory when he happened upon this amazing visual.It's called a moonbow.As the name suggests, a moonbow is the same thing as a rainbow. Like a rainbow, it's formed when light is refracted from water droplets suspended in the atmosphere.The difference, of course, is that the moon doesn't produce its own light. So it's light from the sun reflecting off the moon's surface, and refracting off water droplets in the air. Sunday night, it was foggy in North Yorkshire, England, where Gwynne captured this photo. Fog = more moisture = greater chance of a moonbow.Moonbows are much fainter than rainbows, since moonlight much weaker than sunlight. The colors can be tough to see with the naked eye, but they come alive in long-exposure photos.Want to take a crack at capturing your own moonbow? You can, when the next supermoon rises.That's just a few weeks from now -- November 14.  It's projected to be the biggest we've seen in the 21st century.

{"_id":"Egyptian ex-President Morsy's life sentence overturned","articleText":"Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court on Tuesday overturned a life sentence handed to ousted President Mohamed Morsy and 18 others for espionage, ordering a retrial in the case, Egyptian state media reported.Morsy and his co-accused were sentenced to life in June 2015 after being convicted of conspiring with Palestinian group Hamas, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and other foreign organizations.As of now, Morsy has only been convicted of a single 20-year sentence for his role in the torture of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in 2012. Morsy has exhausted his appeals in this case. He still faces other charges as well.2 overturned sentences in 2 weeksThe overturning of Morsy's life sentence is the latest development in a series of cases involving the one-time leader. In addition to the overturned life sentence, the same Egyptian court last week tossed out a death sentence against him for a jailbreak during the chaos of the 2011 Arab Spring protests.Morsy and the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement were voted into power in 2012 following the uprising but were ousted in a 2013 military coup. He was tried en masse with Mohamed Badie -- the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as more than 100 alleged members of the outlawed group, according to state media.Their death sentences were widely criticized as political grandstanding. The Egyptian government banned the Muslim Brotherhood and declared it a terrorist organization after the military seized power.More charges for Morsy?In June, Morsy was sentenced to 25 years in prison for leaking state secrets to Qatar and received another 15-year sentence for lesser charges. According to state media, his appeal is scheduled for later this month.Morsy is set for another hearing next month on charges of insulting the judiciary, state media reported.CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/africa/egypt-morsy-life-sentence-overturned/index.html"}
{"_id":"Electoral College voter: I'm getting death threats","articleText":" (CNN)A college student from Michigan said Wednesday that he has received death threats after being chosen to cast an Electoral College vote for his state in December.Although the presidential election was won by Donald Trump on November 8, it's not official until December 19, when all 538 members of the Electoral College will come together to cast their votes. Michael Banerian, the youth vice-chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, will be one of his state's 16 electors. The honor of being selected, a role typically bestowed to recognize a person's service and dedication to their political party, has come at a price, Banerian told CNN's Brianna Keilar .\"Obviously, this election cycle was pretty divisive. Unfortunately it's bled over into the weeks following the election and I have been inundated with death threats, death wishes, generally angry messages trying to get me to change my vote to Hillary Clinton or another person, and unfortunately, it's gotten a little out of control.\" Banerian said.Banerian said he has been threatened with violence. \"I've had people talk about putting a bullet in the back of my mouth. I've had death wishes or people just saying 'I hope you die.' Or, 'do society a favor, throw yourself in front of a bus,'\" he said.In every other presidential election in history, Electoral College members have voted in accordance with their state's voters, meaning that, in Michigan, Banerian and his fellow electors will cast their votes for Donald Trump. But even if he could change his vote, it would still be against the law to do so in his state, Banerian said.

{"_id":"Eli Lilly's promising Alzheimer's drug fails in clinical trial","articleText":" (CNN)A large trial of a drug to treat dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease has ended in failure after people receiving the treatment showed no significant improvements to those taking a placebo.The failure of the much anticipated drug, which showed promise in earlier results, is being seen as a disappointing setback, but not the end of hopes to fight the disease.On Wednesday, US drugmaker Eli Lilly announced that the Phase 3 clinical trial of its drug solanezumab did not progress as planned.\"Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo,\" the company said in a statement.Almost 47 million people live with dementia worldwide and that number is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is estimated to account for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.The trial More than 2,100 patients diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's participated in the multi-national trial, called EXPEDITION3, which began in 2013.In a statement, Lilly's chairman, president and CEO John C. Lechleiter said the company was \"disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\" He added that the results would be evaluated to determine the impact on its other potential Alzheimer's drugs in the pipeline. The company's share price dropped more than 10% on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. More details are expected to be announced on Thursday.Attacking amyloid plaques Like other anti-amyloid drugs, solanezumab was designed to reduce the build up of amyloid plaques on the brain, which are thought to contribute to the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease.The results now bring that underlying biology into question.\"The failure of this trial is something that could be another step back for the amyloid theory,\" said Professor Bryce Vissel, Roth Fellow and Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).However, while disappointing, the results will spur the scientific community to examine other potential cures for the disease, he said.\"One could call it the beginning of a next generation of efforts for treatment for Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"We're getting a much deeper understanding of the disease and a more robust approach to curing it. Ultimately, this will bring about approaches to solve the disease within our lifetime.\"Dr Mark Dallas, Lecturer in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience at the University of Reading agreed. \"While this is disappointing news, we will have to wait for the full data set to see if there are any nuggets of information that provide insight into the lack of effect of solanezumab,\" he said. \"It's another setback for the Alzheimer's community, however the information we obtain from these setbacks is vital in our common goal of generating a novel treatment to tackle Alzheimer's disease.\"Vissel said attention had now turned to the next big trial of a drug called aducanumab by Biogen, which works by attacking plaques from another angle. The drug showed promise from preliminary results announced in September, though final results are still a while away.For many, the failure of Lilly's solanezumab trials wasn't surprising.\"There is still no convincing evidence that shows a clear relationship between amyloid deposition and deficits in cognition in humans,\" said Professor Peter Roberts from the University of Bristol.\"All we really know is that evidence of amyloid deposition begins up to maybe 20 years before the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This might be a good indicator, but does not prove causality.\" \"This is disappointing but not a great surprise,\" added Robert Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at UCL who believes the decades of failed drug trials highlight the challenge that still lies ahead. \"What we have learned from several decades of research and hundreds of failed Alzheimer's disease trials is that no matter how promising the basic and early phase data, all that really matters is the results of these late phase effectiveness trials.\"The US Alzheimer's Association said it hoped ongoing tests for solanezumab and other anti-amyloid agents would continue.\"These other programs have different ways of acting on the amyloid pathway and some are also addressing the disease at a much earlier stage when these drugs may still prove to be effective,\" it said. As populations increasingly live into their older years, the need to tackle the problem remains.\"Dementia is society's biggest health challenge and we've seen time and again that developing effective treatments is incredibly difficult,\" said Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer's Society. \"This is only one drug of several in the pipeline and they aim to tackle dementia in different ways, so we should not lose hope. Dementia can and will be beaten.\"CNN's Meera Senthilingam contributed to this reporting.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/health/alzheimers-drug-test-fails/index.html"}

{"_id":"Enigma codebreaking site to become elite UK cyber defense school","articleText":" (CNN)Bletchley Park, where British codebreakers famously cracked Nazi Germany's Enigma cypher, is to become home to the country's future cyber defenders.An elite school for talented teen hackers is planned for the site, to open in 2018.During World War II the mansion house in Buckinghamshire, England, was home to the British government's Code and Cypher School, whose critical but top secret work has become well known through books and movies like the Oscar-winning \"The Imitation Game.\"It was here that codebreakers like Alan Turing successfully cracked Germany's Enigma encryption system, allowing them to intercept the enemy's communications and hastening the end of the war.Turing Law: Thousands of gay men to be pardoned for abolished sex offensesNow the site is to become home to the UK's first National College of Cyber Security, to open once a £5 million ($6.2 million) restoration project is complete.The school, with capacity for up to 500 students ages 16 to 19, is part of a plan to strengthen the UK's defenses against what experts say are growing cyber threats.Alastair MacWillson, chair of Qufaro, the cybersecurity group behind the project, said he expects the site's distinguished history to be an inspiration to students.\"It's a rich story. We're leveraging the legacy and heritage,\" he said. \"The government says cyber security and the measures to defend the country are the new codes and cyphers. So where better to do this?\"Gaps in education systemMacWillson said the initiative will harness the expertise in Britain's young hacker community and put them on a pathway to safeguarding the country's cyber security.\"There is some real talent out there, people with extraordinary capabilities in this area, and its usually youngsters that are good at gaming theory and hacking systems,\" he said.However, while there are centers of excellence for this specialization at the university level, gaps in the education system currently allow talent to slip through the cracks at the high school level, MacWillson said.\"The government was concerned on two fronts -- that the country isn't capturing raw talent, but also that it's maybe letting raw talent err onto the dark side,\" he said.The school will be a so-called \"genius college\" for prodigiously talented students, with 40% of the curriculum devoted to cyber learning and the rest to STEM subjects such as math and engineering.The school would also take advantage of an existing incubator for tech companies based at Bletchley Park to provide internships for students. Growing cyber threatBritain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), as the former Government Code and Cypher School is now known, has applauded the plan, saying it \"welcomes initiatives that promote and develop skills in cyber security.\" A GCHQ spokeswoman said the concept was \"interesting, especially if it can provide a pathway for talented students from schools that are not able to provide the support they need.\"The head of MI5, Britain's security and counterintelligence agency, warned last month that the country faced a growing covert threat from Russia, involving \"high-volume activity out of sight with the cyber-threat.\"The Kremlin rejected the claims.Earlier this month the British government unveiled its National Cyber Security Strategy, aimed at tackling cyber threats facing the country and making the UK one of the safest places in the world to do business online.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/europe/uk-bletchley-park-college/index.html"}
{"_id":"European Space Agency confirms Mars lander lost during descent","articleText":" (CNN)The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed the Schiaparelli spacecraft, which was expected to land on Mars on Wednesday, has been lost.During a press conference on Thursday, scientists said that Schiaparelli stopped transmitting around 50 seconds before the expected landing. The agency suspects something went wrong when the parachute was jettisoned: \"The ejection itself appears to have occurred earlier than expected, but analysis is not yet complete,\" it said in a statement.ESA's Director General, Jan Wörner, said Schiaparelli's primary role was to test whether they could successfully land a probe on Mars. \"Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future,\" Wörner said.David Parker, ESA's Director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration said it's what they wanted from a test.\"We have data coming back that allows us to fully understand the steps that did occur, and why the soft landing did not occur,\" he said.The probe was equipped with nine thrusters that were due to be activated for the last 30 seconds to help cushion the landing. But while they were confirmed to have been briefly activated, the agency believes they switched off sooner than expected.The anxious waitScientists with ESA were anxiously waiting for news from Schiaparelli yesterday.After a high-speed, fiery descent through the Martian atmosphere, scientists at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany, did not get a signal back from the 1,272 pound (577 kilogram) probe.The mission, a joint venture between ESA's ExoMars program and the Russian state corporation Roscosmos, was primarily designed to test ESA's ability to land on Mars. The agency has a bigger mission, the ExoMars rover project, slated for 2020.Sister ship is safeSchiaparelli's companion craft, an orbiter with a much longer mission, successfully made it to orbit on Wednesday. The Trace Gas Orbiter will investigate the source of methane on Mars, which could be a sign of life or geological processes.The orbiter adds to a fleet of spacecraft that are looking for signs of life on our neighboring planet.The presence of methane is a signature of life on Earth, so the orbiting spacecraft will be trying to detect it and determine where it is coming from.

Former USA Gymnastics physician Dr. Larry Nassar was arrested and charged with three counts of criminal sexual assault of a person under 13 years old, according to court documents. A conviction could result in a life sentence. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday morning, according to 55th District Court Magistrate Mark Blumer's office.Nassar's attorney, Matthew Newburg, met with him Monday afternoon at the county jail. Nassar declined to comment, Newburg told CNN. \"We did anticipate these charges being brought. We have a plan in place and we are prepared to defend him,\" Newburg said. Michigan State University Police conducted the investigation in tandem with the State of Michigan Attorney General's Office. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced in early October he was reviewing sexual assault allegations against Nassar. Schuette said his office was taking over the investigation from police at Michigan State University after a request from Chief Jim Dunlap. A news release from Schuette said Nassar is a former associate professor at the university.\"This complex case is believed to have crossed into multiple jurisdictions in Michigan, and possibly across state lines, putting the Department of Attorney General in the best position to effectively investigate and prosecute this case,\" the October 6 statement said. Nassar, 53, was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women's crew teams as well as an associate professor in the College of Osteopathic Medicine. Nassar served as the USA Gymnastics physician through four Olympics. Court documents say the first incident of sexual assault occurred July 1, 1998.

{"_id":"ExoMars: New Mars probe adds to fleet searching for life","articleText":" (CNN)A new phase in the continuing search for life on Mars begins this month -- adding to a fleet of spacecraft probing the Red Planet.And it comes as US President Barack Obama, writing for CNN, pledged to send humans to Mars by the 2030s \"with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\"\"I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space.\" The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter arrives next week to start its mission looking for more evidence about methane production and other atmospheric gases that could signal biological activity.The venture is a joint project between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian state corporation Roscosmos.In 2014, NASA's Curiosity rover detected a large spike in methane in the atmosphere, prompting debate about what was causing it.Methane puzzleThe ESA  probe aims to find out more.\"Organisms on Earth release methane as they digest nutrients. However, other purely geological processes, such as the oxidation of certain minerals, also release methane,\"  ESA says.Adam Stevens, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh and the UK Centre for Astrobiology, has worked on the science associated with the ExoMars mission and in preparation for it.He explained that although methane is present on other planets, on Earth it is a signature of life.\"What we find on Earth is that ... some 90% of Earth's methane is biological, whether that's active now or from past biology that's decomposing,\" he said. \"That means if we look at another planet like Mars ... maybe that's a sign of biology.\"Stevens stressed that methane can be produced by other means, and not just life, but told CNN that the ExoMars mission will help \"rule out some possibilities ... to tease out what is going on.\"For example, he said, if methane was found at the poles where it's extremely cold then the methane is not produced by something that's melting.ESA to test landerESA says the probe will also try to detect deposits of water ice below the surface, and help guide the selection of a suitable landing site for future missions.One of the aims is to test a landing craft called Schiaparelli. The lander will separate from the orbiter and then using a parachute and thruster will descend to the surface.ESA says the impact will be cushioned by a structure similar to a crumple zone in a car.The landing site has been chosen because it contains a layer of iron oxide that on Earth almost always forms in an environment containing liquid water, ESA says.Schiaparelli has been designed to operate for a few days and will measure wind speed, temperature, humidity and pressure.This mission is part of a longer-term ESA project to explore the Red Planet. The next ExoMars launch is planned for 2020 and will include a rover that can drill into the Martian surface to analyze samples.The Europeans will be hoping for more success than on their previous mission to the surface of Mars. A British-built probe called Beagle 2, part of ESA's Mars Express program, was lost on Christmas Day in 2003 after contact failed during the descent.But last year, images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that the craft had successfully landed but failed to properly deploy its solar panels.Mass Mars explorationSchiaparelli and its orbiting sister craft make up a growing swarm of satellites and surface robots that are continuing to hunt for signs of life on our neighboring planet. Two NASA rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, arrived shortly after Beagle 2. Spirit got stuck in the Martian soil in 2009 and its mission was ended in 2011 but Opportunity has traveled more than a marathon distance of 26 miles and is still operational.NASA's Curiosity rover arrived in 2012 and is still returning stunning images of cliff faces on Mars.An Indian Mars probe called MOM has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2014 and ESA's Mars Express orbiter has been returning data since its arrival in 2003.Nasa's MAVEN orbiter is also investigating the Martian atmosphere after it began its mission in orbit in 2014.New missions plannedAs well as ESA's future ExoMars missions, NASA is planning another rover expedition. Landing in February 2021, it too will be scouring the surface for signs of life.NASA says the rover will have a nuclear power source that can last at least 10 years and will include a test for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere -- something that might be crucial for future human exploration. Its cameras will be able to generate 3-D maps, while instruments will try to detect and analyze organic molecules in the rocks and dust.The rover will also be equipped with ground-penetrating radar to look for unusual features such as ice or brine.Private companies are keen to join the trips to the Red Planet. SpaceX has tested a new rocket it plans to use for a future mission and Mars One says it will start training astronauts next year, aiming for a launch in 2026.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/12/health/mars-mission-esa-fleet-exomars/index.html"}

{"_id":"FLOTUS welcomes the White House Christmas tree","articleText":" (CNN)It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas at the White House. First lady Michelle Obama kicked off her final decking of the halls Friday, welcoming this year's official White House Christmas tree to the Blue Room, an annual tradition since 1966.  The first lady watched as the tree was delivered atop a horse-drawn carriage on the front White House drive, the sound of jingle bells on the horses, and a four-piece military band playing \"O Christmas Tree.\" She was joined by nephews Austin and Aaron Robinson, first pets Bo and Sunny, and national tree contest award winners Dave and Mary Vander Velden, of Oconto, Wisconsin. \"These are our replacement kids,\" Obama joked of her young nephews, saying one of her teenage daughters was still asleep. She congratulated the Vander Veldens on their winning tree. But the Vander Veldens' tree was not quite tall or full enough in time due to Wisconsin weather conditions this season. Instead, an alternate 19-foot Douglas fir from Pennsylvania took its place, according to the National Christmas Tree Association. The Wisconsin tree will still be on display elsewhere in the White House. \"Unfortunately nature was not on his (Dave Vander Velden's) side and none of his trees grew to meet the specifications of height and fullness needed for the Blue Room. Our association selects the winners every other year and this can happen,\" said Ann O'Connor of the National Christmas Tree Association.

{"_id":"Family of baby named after Angela Merkel loses asylum bid ","articleText":" (CNN)A Syrian family that named their baby Angela Merkel after arriving in Germany last year has had their application for asylum in the country rejected.Mamon Alhamza, 27, and Tema Alhawar, 21, fled the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli last year to escape the civil war that has ravaged the nation, leaving an estimated 400,000 people dead. Alhawar, who was heavily pregnant when she arrived in Germany, gave birth to their daughter on December 27 while the couple was living at an accommodation facility for refugees in Duisburg.Writing to CNN on WhatsApp, Alhamza said the couple had decided to name their daughter after the chancellor as an \"expression of thanks to the German government\" for their warm welcome into the country and the care his wife received during childbirth.The pair wanted to show their gratitude to German chancellor Angela Merkel, their daughter's namesake, for the open door immigration policy which allowed them to seek refuge in the nation last November.The family, now living in Mönchengladbach, received a letter from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees with their asylum decision last week. The documents, which Alhamza shared with CNN, state: \"Asylum application rejected.\" Alhamza, Alhawar, and 11-month-old Angela were granted family subsidiary protection, which affords them a residence permit for one year, with the option to extend for a further two years.\"I was shocked at the decision of the court not to give us asylum,\" Alhamza said, adding that he hopes to appeal the decision. He said he and Alhawar had come to Germany, along with hundreds of thousands of other migrants last year, believing that Syrians would be granted asylum there.'Open door' policyAccording to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, 258,597 Syrians applied for asylum in Germany between January and October 2016. Of that number, 93,925 received subsidiary protection, like Alhamza's family, while 577 were granted asylum. \"Subsidiary protection applies when neither refugee protection nor entitlement to asylum can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin,\" a press officer with the Federal Office said in an email to CNN.Germany opened its doors to refugees last year, saying it would allow Syrian citizens to stay in the country regardless of where they entered the European Union, flouting the Dublin regulation's rules on asylum claims.A bureaucratic tweet posted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in Nuremburg on August 25, 2015, announced that Germany's gates were open -- spurring families like the Alhamzas to reach the central European nation.\"We are at present largely no longer enforcing Dublin procedures for Syrian citizens,\" the tweet read.The Federal Ministry of the Interior announced in September that 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015, revising the number downwards from 1.1 million. It was not clear what percentage of those were Syrian nationals. According to the Federal Office, 428,468 Syrians were registered last year under Germany's EASY system, which is used for the initial registration of migrants and refugees arriving in the country.'No future in Syria'Alhamza said he was studying at Al Furat University's Faculty of Law in Hasaka before the war broke out, and hopes to continue his studies in Germany.\"I want to learn the language and find a good job,\" he told CNN.Three days after baby Angela was born, a series of suicide bombings rattled Qamishli, the city near the Turkish border that the Alhamzas had left behind, according to local media reports and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Alhamza said his family has a \"happy and secure life\" in Germany, and would like to settle in the country.\"I would have liked to stay here to build a better future for my family,\" he said. \"We do not have any future in Syria.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/europe/syrian-angela-merkel-asylum-rejected/index.html"}
{"_id":"Fans' favorite live sports requirement? Bandwidth","articleText":" (CNN)Sports fans expect a lot when they attend a game. Entertainment. Good times. A win.But according to a survey by StubHub, in this era, there's one key desire that can't be overlooked: bandwidth.The ticket seller's 2014-15 study of consumer insights (PDF), shared with CNN, shows that smartphones and social media have become increasingly important in this Internet-encrusted age. It's not enough to attend the game; you have to show everyone you're there, too, preferably with a selfie or Facebook tag. Technology is \"really changing the way fans are attending live events, whether it be sports, concerts or otherwise,\" StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp said. For example, Super Bowl data usage has more than tripled since 2011. At the 2011 Super Bowl, fans used 177 GB of data. Three years later, that number had shot up to 624 GB.Moreover, the number of social posts uploaded from the event jumped from 500,000 to 1.8 million. \"It seems like you can't attend a sports event without taking a picture now,\" Papp said.Here are some other takeaways from StubHub's research:The most popular North American pro sports team by Twitter followers is from the NBA.That would be the Los Angeles Lakers, which has about 4.5 million followers. The leading squads from the other three major pro sports leagues -- the New York Yankees (MLB), the New England Patriots (NFL) and the Chicago Blackhawks (NHL) -- have between 1.1 and 1.7 million followers.\"The NFL dominates American conversations,\" Papp said. \"But the NBA is much more of a global brand, and the Lakers are a global brand.\"Pro baseball teams dominate the list of top sellers overall -- but for individual games, college teams have some power.That's partly because there are 81 home games for each MLB team, says Papp, so teams such as the San Francisco Giants, the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have more events to sell. (StubHub did not reveal prices.) Intriguingly, however, the single-game leader is the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. That's a case of a high-performing team and the laws of supply and demand, says Papp, since capacity at tiny Cameron Indoor Stadium is fewer than 10,000 seats. \"When you think about the hardest ticket to get and the hottest ticket, it makes sense,\" he said. Other college teams on the per-event list include the Notre Dame, Texas A&M and Alabama football teams, popular squads all.The musical tastes of sports leagues' fans don't necessarily fit the leagues' popular images.StubHub asked, \"If you bought a specific (pro team's) ticket at StubHub in the past 5 years, what other concert purchase have you made this year?\" Though the answers were necessarily skewed by who was touring in the past couple years, there were still a few surprises.Sure, some relationships fit expectations. The NFL skewed more country than the other pro leagues, with top draws including Luke Bryan and Garth Brooks. New Yorker Billy Joel was the top selection for fans of the Jets, Devils, Islanders, Knicks and Mets. Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers rooters both had the Bay Area's Grateful Dead at the top of their lists.But NHL fans weren't all hard rockers -- Ottawa Senators fans picked One Direction -- and MLB fans, perhaps tabbed as old, included matchups with Ariana Grande (Milwaukee Brewers) and the ubiquitous Taylor Swift (Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates and Tampa Bay Rays).More bandwidth? Or less?Smartphones and other portable devices aren't going away. Will venues accommodate them or stick with the idea that the game's the thing?Papp isn't sure.\"I don't think stadiums have really caught up to this yet,\" he said. Certainly, newer facilities are focusing on multimedia fan experiences. Levi's Stadium, where the 2016 Super Bowl will be held, was called \"the most high-tech sports venue yet\" in a 2014 Time article  -- which only makes sense, since it's in the heart of Silicon Valley. Comcast, one of the country's biggest bandwidth providers, will have a prominent presence at the Atlanta Braves' new SunTrust Park, scheduled to open in 2017. But fans are also keenly familiar with the sensation of sitting down at their seats, trying to post something to social media -- and being met by the \"spinning wheel of death.\" Moreover, as technology ventures into new areas, such as the live streaming of Periscope or Meerkat, venues and teams may consider it a threat, not a boon.On the concert side, there has already been a backlash against fans using cellphones, Papp observes, with some venues blocking signals.Sports, too, is part of an ever-evolving relationship.\"As far as a team is concerned, they just want to get butts in the seats,\" he said. \"You want to get people in, and if you can do it with technology, you're going to do that, and you'll make it easier to share with their friends.\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/12/17/living/stubhub-survey-sports-fans-feat/index.html"}
{"_id":"Favelagrafia: Residents of Rio's favelas reveal the photographic truth about their communities","articleText":" (CNN)Poverty, crime and danger are common words used to describe Rio de Janeiro's hilltop slums, known as favelas. Both hated and romanticized by the media, their story has most often been written from the outside. Related article: Inside Brazil's sprawling art parkBut now the residents of the slums that punctuate Brazil's second largest city are fighting to recapture the narrative and make it their own.Their weapon of choice? The camera-phone.In a project dubbed Favelagrafia (Portuguese for slum photography), nine photographers -- amateur and professional -- from Rio's favelas were chosen to capture what everyday life really looks like.Art director, Andre Havt and designer Karina Abicalil are the minds behind the project.\"Rio de Janeiro has more than 22% of its population living in slums, but those residents are integrated into the city. They work and study outside of their neighborhoods, but people outside know little about them. There is an invisible wall that separates the realities,\" Havt told CNN.For him, the photos break down those barriers.  \"There are elements of discomfort, beauty, provocation and irony, but most of all there is truth. Using residents' camera phones also made people more comfortable. They're less invasive than big cameras,\" he added.The collection, supported by Rio de Janeiro's Culture Department, has been so successful that several pictures were chosen to be displayed at the city's Museum of Modern Art (MAM) until December.Havt told CNN the project's popularity has forced him to rethink his own prejudices.\"When meeting Elana Paulina, the photographer of the Santa Marta Slum, I thought, 'how can a driver of a funicular at a slum become a photographer?' Well, she can and her photographs are in the museum with all the others.\"Related article: Here's your 90-second A-Z of Brazilian cultureBelow, CNN spoke with some of Favelagrafia's photographers.Elana Paulino, Santa MartaWhen not driving passengers, Elana Paulino, 34, is raising her four children while she completes a degree in radiology. \"I have lived in Santa Marta since I was born,\" she told CNN. \"I loved participating in this project. The important thing with these pictures is that they show a different side of people who live in slums: we are just like everyone else.\"Anderson Valentim, BorelOne of the most popular photos shared on social media comes from Anderson Boren, a music teacher who has been living in the Borel favela for 34 years.Through his music lessons he comes across many talented young Brazilians who are often dismissed as criminals and delinquents.\"This project changes the way that our slums are seen from the outside. Even with the big social and economic difficulties (they face), most citizens work, study and make a respectable living. But not even 10% of that is reported in newspapers,\" said Valentim. \"Our fight is to get that message out there.\" Jessica Higino, MineiraAt only 23-years-old, Jessica Higino is one of the youngest Favelagrafia photographers. She told CNN her photos don't hide anything. \"Every photographer has a different style. My pictures are some of the colder, gloomier ones in the collection because I wanted to show the wasted potential of the slums so that people want to stimulate these places and their culture,\" Higino told CNN.\"At the same time, I show children playing football and rushing through the alleys all day. I show a bit of everything with my photos because I want people to learn everything about my community,\" she added.Josiane Santana, Complexo do AlemaoJosiane Santana, 29, lives in one of Rio's largest slums and also wanted to use photography to demystify how her neighborhood is seen.\"I'm from Complexo do Alemao which is seen as one of the most dangerous places in Rio de Janeiro, but I don't want people to look at it like that,\" she told CNN.A journalism student, Santana said she wanted to show the vibrant and bright side of her home that rarely gets showcased in the media.\"Complexo da Alemao is a beautiful place. There are powerful young people that do wonderful work here. In my pictures you can see children, diverse architecture, colorful alleys. You can see talent,\" she said.The final message? An invitation to the slums For the project's art director, Andre Havt, the success shows how photography can change stories, people and prejudices. \"We invite everyone to enter these slums and let their art transform you,\" Havt told CNN. \"In Favelagrafia, photography swaps guns for musical instruments and transforms chaos and stereotypes into beauty.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/arts/favelagrafia/index.html"}
{"_id":"Federal appeals court puts Obamacare lawsuit on hold until after Trump's inauguration ","articleText":" (CNN)A federal appeals court ordered Monday that a lawsuit filed against the Affordable Care Act by lawyers for the House of Representatives be put on temporary hold until after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.The order issued by the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reflects the change of administration, and it delays the briefing schedule in the case until Trump is in office.Last month, lawyers for the House asked the court to put the case on temporary hold. In briefs they argued that they were discussing options for resolution with the \"President-Elect's transition team.\"\"A temporary stay of the briefing schedule will provide the President-Elect and his future Administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal,\" wrote Thomas G. Hungar, the General Counsel of the House of Representatives.  \"There is at least a significant possibility of a meaningful change in policy in the new Administration that could either obviate the need for resolution of this appeal or affect the nature and scope of the issues presented for review,\" Hungar wrote.At issue is the \"cost sharing\" provision in the law that requires insurance companies offering health plans through the law to reduce out-of-pocket costs for policy holders who qualify, which are enrollees with incomes below 250% of the povery level or $29,700 for a single person. The government offsets the costs to insurance companies by reimbursing them.But lawyers for the House argued that Congress did not properly approve the money for those reimbursements.US District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, sided with the challengers last May but said that she would stay her ruling pending appeal.\"Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one,\" she wrote.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/aca-obamacare-lawsuit-held/index.html"}

{"_id":"Fidel Castro bedeviled US presidents for decades","articleText":" (CNN)Fidel Castro visited the United States only a handful of times. But the late Cuban dictator for decades had an outsized effect on the presidential politics of his northern neighbor.Castro, who died late Friday, long befuddled American administrations, Republican and Democratic. Commanders in chief found they had limited options against the bearded leader of an island nation just 90 miles off America's southern shores. His country in 1962 famously became the nexus of a near-nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis. The 13-day Cold War-era standoff calmed only when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev backed down against President John F. Kennedy's administration, removing nuclear warheads from Cuba. More recently President Barack Obama sought to thaw years of hostility between the US and Cuba. On December 17, 2014, Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro (Fidel's younger brother and appointed successor) began the process of normalizing relations for the first time since they were severed in 1961.Here are five ways Fidel Castro influenced American presidential politics and government, overtly and indirectly. Bad first impressionsCastro wasn't immediately labeled an enemy after his leftist forces overthrew the Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959. Castro visited the US in mid-April to address the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the Council on Foreign Affairs. The GOP administration of President Dwight Eisenhower also wanted to size up Castro. While Eisenhower wouldn't meet the insurgent Cuban leader, Vice President Richard Nixon was dispatched for the task. It didn't go well. In the Washington meeting, Nixon hoped to push Castro \"in the right direction,\" he said at the time, away from radical policies. But Castro acted confrontational and standoff-ish, according to American officials, who were used to open access to casinos and sugar cane during Batista's long reign.The CIA soon began developing plans to arm and train a group of Cuban exiles. This would play out, in failure, amid the April 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco ordered up by Eisenhower's Democratic successor, Kennedy.Intelligence opsThose anti-Castro plans had actually played a role in the hard-fought presidential race between Nixon and Kennedy -- and for decades have influenced the debate about just how much information to give out to presidential candidates on intelligence and national security.Eight years earlier, during the early Cold War years, presidential candidates for the first time were provided intelligence briefings. The thinking was that the winner shouldn't be caught cold about thorny world problems -- and clandestine operations -- upon assuming power. In the closing weeks of the 1960 presidential race, the Kennedy campaign released a statement calling for a group of exiled Cubans to retake their country. The nominee was asleep when the statement went out and never saw it, USA Today reported this August.But Nixon, who was running against Kennedy, knew his Democratic opponent had been briefed about Cuba and figured he was aware of their plans for the exiles to attack.Nixon seethed over the matter. But having been privy to classified information spelling out the Cuban exile plan, he took the opposite view publicly during the campaign in order not to accidentally divulge it. He did try to get at the issue through a side door, however, in one of four televised debates against Kennedy, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate.\"I think that Sen. Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he has made during the course of the campaign,\" Nixon said during their final face-off. Nixon narrowly lost the presidency to Kennedy, and for years he nursed a grudge against the intelligence community, suggesting it had aided his rival.While the precise nature of intelligence on Cuba provided to JFK during the campaign remains murky, it's fair to say the episode played into Nixon's long-standing resentments against the Kennedy family and intelligence officials, which would return to haunt him during his own presidency, from 1969-1974. Intelligence briefings for presidential candidates remain a sensitive issue. During the 2016 campaign, critics of Republican nominee Donald Trump warned that he might share secret information, on Twitter or elsewhere. And Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state, which the FBI called reckless in its implications for classified information, led for GOP calls that she not receive the briefings.Exploding cigars?A decade-and-a-half and three presidencies after Kennedy, Castro's regime still vexed American lawmakers. In 1975, amid widespread distrust of government after Vietnam and Watergate, the Senate's Church committee probed the CIA and other governmental operations. The panel found that CIA employees had at times run what seemed like a rogue agency, including a batch of assassination attempts against Castro formulated by subordinate employees without their superiors' permission. Some were borderline comical and ham-handed. Assassination plots reportedly included exploding cigars -- a product favored by the Cuban strongman -- and even a poisoned ballpoint pen. Critics of the Church committee raged that precious intelligence secrets were being aired publicly, which threatened national security. That approach remained a matter of fierce debate in the post-9/11 era. Defenders of President George W. Bush pushed back against efforts to reveal interrogation methods of terror suspects. Boatlift politicsCastro, if indirectly, nearly prevented the Bill Clinton presidency from ever happening. In 1980, the Cuban dictator startled American officials by allowing a mass emigration from the island, which became known as the Mariel boatlift. The exodus included not just political exiles but a bunch of refugees that had been released from Cuban jails and mental health facilities. President Jimmy Carter's administration housed some of these people in Arkansas, just as Clinton, the nation's youngest governor, was running for re-election. On June 1, 1980, a riot broke at Fort Chaffee, a military installation in Arkansas where the Cubans were being housed. And locals weren't happy about it, noted The Washington Post 35 years later, in the midst of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\"The White House message seemed to be: 'Don't complain, just handle the mess we gave you,'\" Clinton, first lady of Arkansas in 1980, later wrote in her memoir \"Living History.\"\"Bill had done just that, but there was a big political price to pay for supporting his President,\" she said of her husband's acquiescence to the plan by a fellow Democrat in the White House.Bill Clinton lost his re-election bid, making him the youngest ex-governor in the country. He then won back the office two years later, setting up his successful White House run a decade down the line. But Clinton long nursed a grudge against Carter, who lost the White House to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Cuban boy hurts Al Gore's hopesCastro's death Friday came 17 years to the day after the rescue of a five-year-old Cuban boy, Elián Gonzalez. Fisherman found the child clinging to an inner tube three miles off the coast of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, after his mother and 11 others perished in their attempt to flee Cuba for the US.A protracted seven-month standoff between American and Cuban authorities followed -- in the shadow of a tight presidential race.In an April 2000 pre-dawn raid, armed US federal agents seized Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives, who wanted him to stay in the US even as the government said he needed to return to Cuba.Within a few hours, the boy was reunited with his father, who had come to the US to plead for his return. Two months later, after a swath of court procedures and anti-Castro demonstrations, they returned to Cuba.Many in the Cuban-American community blamed the Clinton administration for turning the child over to the communist nation. After all, Attorney General Janet Reno had put in place the legal mechanisms for doing so -- which she defended as a family reunification measure prescribed by law.Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee that year, came in for harsh criticism. He ended up losing Florida -- and the presidency -- to Bush, then governor of Texas, by an official count of 537 votes out of more than 6 million cast. While it's impossible to ascribe one factor to Gore's razor-thin defeat, the Elián Gonzalez effort likely ginned up voting among South Florida's stridently anti-Castro Cuban-American population. That's the working theory, at least, of author Jeff Greenfield, in his counter-factual historical eBook novel \"43: When Gore Beat Bush.\" Greenfield, a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst, posits that had Elian Gonzalez's mother not died in the journey from Cuba, that matter never would have become such a public spectacle -- and that many voters in the Cuban-American community would not have been enraged at the Clinton administration. Greenfield noted that Gore received only about 20% of Cuban-American votes in 2000, according to exit polls, while Clinton won about 35% in his 1996 re-election bid.Sixteen years later, in the waning days of Castro's life, he continued to feature in American presidential politics.Trump, on his way to an upset victory over Hillary Clinton, pledged on the campaign trail to unravel the Obama administration's détente with Cuba.

Coyote than Jason Bourne.\"More people have tried to murder the world's most famous socialist than any man alive,\" according to the 2006 British documentary \"638 Ways to Kill Castro.\" Today, Cuban officials claim Castro survived more than 600 attempts on his life, a figure that is impossible to confirm.\"If surviving assassination attempts were an Olympic event, I would win the gold medal,\" Castro liked to tell interviewers.His reputation as a cheater of death took hold early. As a young revolutionary he was reported dead twice by Cuba's press -- \"perishing\" once when he led a failed uprising against a military barracks and again when he returned from exile by boat with a guerrilla force.The number of people wanting Castro dead -- or at least gone -- rose after he seized power in 1959, took over US property on the island, embraced the Soviet Union and forced thousands of Cubans into exile. A mob hitFew had as much reason to want Castro dead as the American mafia. Before the revolution, US mobsters paid off Cuban officials to let them operate hotels, casinos and brothels on the island, just 90 miles from Florida but well out of US jurisdiction. Castro brought the party to a crashing halt, seizing the mobsters' casinos and hotels and sending them scurrying back to the States.And that led to an unusual partnership.A CIA agent met with mobster Sam Giancana in Miami in 1960. Giancana agreed to help the American government kill Castro and even said the mob would waive their usual fee, according to declassified CIA reports.\"Sam suggested they not resort to firearms, but if he could be furnished with some type of potent pill, that could be placed in Castro's food or drink,\" according to a \"Secret - Eyes Only\" CIA cable that was released in 2007 as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. Cyanide pills were delivered via the mob's contacts to the former Hilton hotel in Havana, now nationalized and renamed the Hotel Habana Libre, the CIA documents show. It served chocolate milkshakes that Castro adored.But on the night that Castro turned up, it all went wrong for the mob assassin, according to Fabián Escalante, a retired Cuban intelligence officer who looked after Castro for decades.\"They ordered a chocolate milkshake, and in the rush and nervousness brought on by the moment for which he had prepared himself for over a year, he broke the capsule of poison while trying to pick it up, as it had stuck to the shelf of the freezer in which it was hidden,\" Escalante wrote in his book \"Executive Action: 634 Ways to Kill Fidel Castro.\"From lover to would-be assassinThe CIA tried pills again, recruiting an erstwhile lover of Castro to deliver the poison. Marita Lorenz had met and fallen in love with Castro shortly after the revolution, she wrote in her 1993 memoir \"Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy.\" They had a whirlwind romance, but then, Lorenz wrote, she was recruited by the CIA when she visited the United States.She was sent back to Cuba with poison pills, Lorenz remembered. But when she got to Havana, she found that the pills had dissolved in the jar of face cream where she had hidden them and, worse yet, Castro was aware of the plot.\"Are you here to kill me?\" Lorenz recalled Castro asking her, and then handing her his pistol as they met in a hotel suite for a tryst. Instead of shooting Castro, according to Lorenz, she fell into the Cuban leader's arms. Taking a diveFollowing the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, more than 1,000 CIA-trained Cuban exiles were taken prisoner by Castro's forces.The US government sent attorney James B. Donovan to negotiate the exiles' release directly with Castro.He spent months talking with Castro, even bringing his son along. The relationship developed and Castro took the Americans along for one of his favorite activities, spear fishing in Cuba's crystalline waters. Those outings inspired a new CIA assassination plot: the toxic dive suit.According to a CIA document that was partially declassified in 2015, it was proposed that Donovan become the \"unwitting purveyor\" of a dive suit contaminated with disfiguring \"Madura foot fungus\" and deadly \"tuberculosis bacteria.\"But, according to the CIA document, Donovan turned down the dive suit he was to present to Castro because he had already given one to Castro as a gift.The Panama plotOver the decades Castro became one of the longest-ruling heads of state in the world, but the plots against him never abated. According to Escalante, Castro was targeted with sniper rifles, explosive-laden baseballs, poisoned cigars and pistols disguised as news cameras. All failed.Even in his fifth decade of power, Castro was still calling out plots against him. In 2000 at the 10th Ibero-American summit of Latin American and European leaders in Panama, Castro publicly denounced what he said was another attempt about to be made against him. \"They are already in Panama and they have introduced weapons and explosives,\" Castro said, holding up a photo of one of his most persistent foes: Luis Posada Carriles.Posada was a Cuban exile and former soldier in the CIA sabotage campaign against the Cuban government. He had been accused by Cuban officials in the 1976 downing of a Cubana airliner and the 1997 bombings of hotels in Havana.Posada, his face riddled with scars from what he said was a failed attempt by Cuban agents to kill him, has at various times both denied and admitted playing a role in the airplane and hotel bombings.The plan, Castro said, was to blow him up while he gave a speech to a Panamanian university.Panamanian police arrested Posada and three other Cuban exiles who were indeed in the country. The men were convicted of endangering public safety but then controversially pardoned.Forced from powerDespite the ever-constant threat of assassination, it was not a bomb or cyanide capsule that removed Castro from power but a botched medical operation.In 2006, having given up his beloved cigars and switched to a mostly-vegetarian diet for health reasons, Castro was afflicted by an intestinal ailment.A series of bungled operations nearly cost him his life, and two years later he was forced to cede power to his younger brother Raul Castro.Increasingly infirm, Castro still traveled with heavy security in the last months of his life, though he was rarely spotted in public. But on his birthday in August, Castro's presence was again felt. Around Cuba, the government posted signs reading \"Long live Fidel.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/08/12/americas/cuba-fidel-castro-at-90-after-assassination-plots/index.html"}
{"_id":"Fidel Castro's death brings joy and grief","articleText":"Havana, Cuba (CNN)The death of Fidel Castro triggered both celebration and mourning as critics welcomed his passing while supporters grieved for the polarizing strongman who dominated Cuba for decades. Castro died Friday at 90. His brother Raul Castro announced his death in a televised statement.\"I say to the people of Cuba, with profound pain I come here to inform our people, our friends of America and the world, that today, 25 November, 2016, at 10:29 pm, died the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz,\" he said.He was to be cremated early Saturday \"following the explicit desires of leader Fidel,\" Raul Castro said. His funeral will be held December 4 in Cuba's second largest city, Santiago de Cuba, following nine days of national mourning, according to Granma, the Cuban state news outlet. Cuba began an official mourning period at 6 a.m. Saturday.  During this time, all activities and public performances will stop, and the flag will be flown at half-staff in public and military establishments. Radio and television will broadcast patriotic and historical programming, Granma reported.In previous mourning periods for prominent figures from the revolution, restaurants and bars have been shut, and singing and celebrations were prohibited. Havana quiet as news slowly spreadsThe streets of Havana were quiet overnight into Saturday, with some Cubans unaware of Castro's death until CNN asked them for their reaction.Their mood seemed downcast, with some shedding tears and many others appearing preoccupied by what might come next. One young Cuban woman told CNN, \"The Cuban people are feeling sad because of the loss of our commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz, and we wish him, wherever he is, that he is blessed, and us Cubans love him.\"In Bíran, a town near Cuba's far eastern tip where Castro was born, people were calling and knocking on the door of his half-brother, Martin Castro. They wanted to know if the hometown revolutionary was dead.\"They have been knocking and calling and asking if it is true,\" said Angel Daniel Castro, a nephew of Fidel Castro's, early Saturday. \"Many people are crying. Some complain of high blood pressure. Fidel was a good man.\"For us, he was like a father. And Cuba sees him as a father. One woman just called crying and saying she had lost her father. Everyone feels it.\"Jubilation in MiamiBut to the north in Florida, revelers spilled into the streets of Miami, the center of the Cuban exile community. They popped champagne, clanged pots, cheered and waved the Cuban flag in jubilation. They stood outside the popular Versailles restaurant in Little Havana with signs reading, \"Satan, Fidel is now yours.\" \"This is a celebration, but not a celebration of death, but a beginning of liberty that we've been waiting for many years. The hope is ... that it opens up Cuba a little bit more,\" a Cuban-American man  said.\"It means a lot for us Cubans,\" another reveler told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV. \"It's a moment that we've been waiting for 55 years. We're free at last. The man that caused so much suffering, so much people to be sad in my country ... has passed away.\"Castro reigned in Havana for nearly five decades with an iron hand, defying a US economic embargo intended to dislodge him. But he lived long enough to see a historic thaw between Cuba and the United States. The two nations re-established diplomatic relations in July, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year.Obama extended \"a hand of friendship to the Cuban people\" as he offered his condolences to Castro's family in a statement Saturday.\"We know that this moment fills Cubans -- in Cuba and in the United States -- with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation,\" he said. \"History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.\"Fidel Castro dies: What now for US-Cuba relations?Historic figure of the 20th centuryTo some, Castro became a romantic figure and a legendary survivor despite what Cuban officials say were more than 600 attempts to kill him. During a rare public appearance in April, Castro marveled that he had lived to his ninth decade.\"Soon I will turn 90 years old, never would such a thing have occurred to me, and it's not the outcome of any effort; it was fate's whim,\" Castro said, discussing his health, usually a taboo subject on the island. \"Soon I will be like everyone else. To all of us comes our turn.\"Castro had many admirers, who saw him as a stalwart with his ubiquitous military fatigues and fiery oratory. He clung to a socialist economic model and one-party Communist rule, even after the Soviet Union disintegrated and most of the rest of the world concluded that state socialism was an idea whose time had come and gone.The Cuban Communist Party mourned for \"the commander of the Cuban Revolution\" with the hashtag #UntilVictoryAlwaysFidel. Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed Castro as a \"great leader\" for the Cuban people and said China had lost \"an intimate and sincere friend,\" according to a statement read out on Chinese state TV.\"He achieved immortal historical achievements for the development of world socialism. He was the great person of our era, and people and history will remember him,\" Xi said. \"Great Castro will live forever. \"Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto called Castro a friend of Mexico, who had promoted bilateral relationships based on \"respect, dialogue and solidarity.\" In an official Kremlin statement sending condolences to the Cuban people, Russian President Vladimir Putin remembered him as a \"symbol of an era in recent world history\" and \"a sincere and reliable friend of Russia.\" Putin saluted Castro for building a \"free and independent Cuba\" and described him as \"an influential member of the international community.\"Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said he and Castro had become \"very good friends,\" in comments reported by Russian state news agency Tass, and that the Cuban \"was an outstanding personality, unique.\"Pakistani politician Imran Khan hailed Castro as \"an iconic revolutionary leader\" who stood against the United States.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend.\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described Castro as \"a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro made significant improvements to the education and health care of his island nation.\"'End of an era for Cuba'Other leaders noted Castro's global impact but did not praise a man whose record on human rights was questionable.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Castro's death marked \"the end of an era for Cuba\" but the start of a new one for the Cuban people, describing him as a \"historic if controversial figure.\"French President François Hollande said Castro \"embodied the Cuban revolution, with the hopes it aroused and then in the disillusion it provoked. Actor of the Cold War, he corresponded to an era which ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" Hollande also said he welcomed the recent thaw in US-Cuba relations.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini described Castro as \"a man of determination and an historical figure\" who had died at a time of \"great challenges and uncertainties\" as well as major changes in his country.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he had had a \"lively discussion\" with Castro during a visit to Cuba in 2014. \"Under former President Castro, Cuba made advances in the fields of education, literacy and health. I hope Cuba will continue to advance on a path of reform and greater prosperity,\" Ban said.Pope Francis sent a telegram to Raul Castro expressing his sorrow for Castro's family and the Cuban people, and offering his prayers.Dissidents repressedMany viewed Castro as an enemy of human rights, who suppressed and imprisoned dissidents. \"I am shedding tears tonight, but they're tears of joy,\" said Armando Salguero, a Miami Herald columnist. \"Hell has a special place for Fidel Castro and there's one less vacancy in hell tonight.\" He said many Cubans were cheering, because they had been forced to come to the United States when they couldn't have the freedom to make a life in their homeland. Repressive laws allow the government to jail and punish its critics, such as dissidents and journalists with long prison sentences, according to Human Rights Watch. The government also uses beatings and public acts of shaming, the organization reported. US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who fled Cuba with her family when she was 8 and went on to become the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, cautioned that \"the death of one dictator will not usher a new wave of change because the rulers of Cuba, whether it's Fidel, Raul, whatever names you give them, they just rule over Cuba with an iron fist.\"Speaking to CNN, she lashed out at the Canadian Prime Minister's statement describing Castro as a \"legendary revolutionary.\"\"I've been reading his sickening love letter to dead Fidel Castro and I'm thinking, 'Sure, you did not lose a loved one to an execution squad. You did not lose a loved one to the gulags in Cuba,' \" she said, while urging any foreign leaders praising Castro to look at the \"real record\" of his decades in charge.\"The only thing that Fidel has been successful in, has not been health nor education, or human rights or democracy, it's been holding onto power -- which is easy to do when you don't have elections,\" she said.CNN's Patrick Oppman -- the only US TV correspondent in Cuba -- reported from Havana, while Madison Park wrote from San Francisco and Laura Smith-Spark from London. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Julia Jones, Alla Eshchenko, Nanling Fang, Yuli Yang, Simon Cullen, Richard Roth, Eliza Mackintosh, Diane Ruggiero and Camille Verdier contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Fidel, the promise and the betrayal","articleText":"Cristina García is the author of seven novels, including \"Dreaming in Cuban,\" \"The Agüero Sisters,\" \"The Lady Matador's Hotel\" and the \"King of Cuba,\" and she edited the anthology \"Cubanísimo: The Vintage Book of Contemporary Cuban Literature.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)Try to imagine the excitement of the Cuban people in 1959 when the young, charismatic barbudo, the bearded one, Fidel Castro, and his band of ragtag rebels managed to pull off the impossible: getting rid of the dictator Fulgencio Batista and ushering in -- or so everyone expected -- a new era in Cuba, a Cuba free of the corruption, violence and cronyism that had pockmarked its history since before its wars of independence.It's impossible to exaggerate the enthusiasm and hope Castro engendered in those early months in power before the realpolitik of the revolution kicked in. Who didn't want sovereignty, free health care or universal literacy? Some, however, who witnessed the summary trials and executions of enemies, real and perceived, saw the writing on the bloody wall -- the notorious paredón of the firing squads -- and fled the country. For others, it took much longer for the bigger picture of the revolution to come into focus, as it was in a constant state of flux, battling detractors, internal dissidents and the Yankee colossus to the north, unhappy that a socialist regime had taken root 100 miles off its coast. At the height of the Cold War, all countries and especially developing ones, were forced to choose one superpower straitjacket or the other. As a result, Castro figured prominently in two of the era's watersheds: the humiliating fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, followed 17 months later by the near cataclysm of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yet while El Comandante wanted to play with the big boys -- in fact he longed to be the biggest and baddest boy -- he was discounted when the showdown came. Kennedy and Khrushchev would decide the fate of the world without him. This blow to Castro's ego was redirected into the restless struggle to find other outlets on the international stage -- in South America, Asia and Africa -- to play out the aggrandized role Castro envisioned for himself and his revolution. In those days, every year of the revolution was named for a cause: Year of Solidarity (1966), Year of the Heroic Guerrilla (1968), the Year of the 10 Million (1970), with its single-minded effort to reach an unrealistic sugar cane harvest goal that nearly bankrupted the country. And despite his failures, El Comandante still found ways to inspire his supporters at home and abroad, supporters who dedicated their lives to the revolution's idealistic vision of justice and equality for all. The truth, unfortunately, was a far cry from this utopia. As early as 1961, Castro threw down the gauntlet in a famous speech to the island's writers and intellectuals: Within the revolution, everything. Against the revolution, nothing. This meant that dissent of any nature -- artistic, political or otherwise -- was forbidden, resulting in an ever-growing intolerance (think of the internment camps for homosexuals and other so-called social deviants in the '60s) for anything perceived as swerving from the party line. What was the party line? Whatever El Comandante decided it was -- for convenience, expedience or the increasingly baroque and self-serving rationalizations he provided for staying in power. Can a revolution that has endured more than a half-century still be called a revolution? Did Castro really believe that in an educated, once-industrious population of more than 11 million souls he was the only one qualified to run the country? (Despite his brother Raúl taking the helm in 2008, everyone knows that Castro pulled the strings behind the scenes.) For years, Castro blamed the US embargo -- a senseless policy if there ever was one -- for Cuba's economic troubles, never once accepting responsibility for the erratic and ill-conceived decisions that have run the country aground. This became painfully apparent after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, presaging the collapse of the Soviet Union and the drastic depletion of the revolution's hefty subsidies along with it. What ensued was a terrible period -- euphemistically called the Special Period -- during which many Cubans actually went hungry. In a desperate bid for foreign currency, Castro threw open the doors to tourism and its attendant problems, including glaring socioeconomic disparities that brought on rampant prostitution, black market hustling and more corruption.A few years ago, when I returned to Cuba after a long absence, I kept hearing the phrase Cerraron la bolsa, meaning, roughly, that the government was bankrupt -- not just financially but morally and spiritually. The beacon that the Cuban Revolution once represented to the world had become nothing more than a grimy night light, with the Cuban people openly detesting Fidel himself -- once a sacred cow -- and his interminable gerontocracy. Los viejos no nos dejan vivir. The old men don't let us live. This is the refrain to a still-popular song on the island. I can only hope that with the passing of El Comandante, the Cuban people on both sides of the Straits of Florida -- and beyond -- can finally live fully and freely in pursuit of their dreams, and begin to heal from this failed, costly experiment.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/opinions/fidel-castro-promise-and-betrayal-garcia/index.html"}

{"_id":"First Brexit, then Trump, now Italy faces its political shockwave","articleText":"Ben Wedeman is CNN's Rome-based senior international correspondent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.Rome (CNN)The world as we know it could come to an end this Sunday. Or it could be just another day. It depends on whom you talk to. This weekend, Italians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution.  The referendum is the brainchild of Matteo Renzi, Italy's energetic, 41-year-old Prime Minister. His intention is to defang the upper house of the Italian Parliament, the Senato, by cutting its numbers from 315 to 100, thus reducing its powers dramatically, making it more of a consultative assembly. Yes, if you read to the end of the previous paragraph, you'll probably agree it sounds dull as dust. But, in the eyes of some, the consequences of a \"No\" vote could be catastrophic. Proponents of the referendum say that the goal is to make the job of governing Italy less complicated. By allowing the cabinet to push through legislation in a reasonable time frame, Italy would become more efficient, productive and prosperous while simultaneously becoming less bureaucratic and bound up in red tape. Italian politics is a noisy, messy, never-ending game of musical chairs, with plenty of motion but little forward movement. The once humming economy is anemic: according to one study, incomes for 97% of Italians haven't gone up in a decade. The country's GDP hasn't really budged since the late 1990s.  Some opponents say that the proposed reforms don't go far enough, while others fear that a weakened Senate will eliminate an important check on power. READ MORE: Italy's referendum a nightmare for EuropeGreat wall of red tapeRegardless of where Italians stand on the upcoming referendum, few here believe all is well. \"Foreigners think life in Italy is like walking on water,\" an Italian woman in Rome recently told me over dinner. \"But we are really dragging ourselves through a swamp.\" Disclaimer: the Italian woman mentioned above is my wife of 32 years. Italy for me isn't just another posting. It's been an integral part of my life since the early 1980s. I'm roughly fluent in Italian, my children are all dual citizens and, for better or for worse, Italy is home.  If \"No\" does win, the worry is that it will send all the wrong signals to foreign investors and financial markets:First, that Italy is simply unwilling to reform and to tear down its great wall of red tape. Second, if the referendum fails and Prime Minister Renzi makes good on his vow to resign, Italy will plunge headlong into a period of political instability.  Many Italian banks already teetering on the edge of  bankruptcy could come crashing down, leading to a domino effect that will spread to the rest of Europe. READ MORE: Italian banks drowning in bad debtEnd of the European dream?If Renzi does step down, others could come to power through early elections -- including, possibly, the loud- and foul-mouthed comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement. Grillo, much like Donald Trump, has capitalized on widespread disaffection with the status quo. His movement, founded in 2009, now appears to garner almost as much support as Renzi's center-left Partito Democratico.The Five Star Movement, which refuses to call itself a party and won key mayoral elections in Turin and Rome earlier this year, is at best Euroskeptic; at worst Eurocidal.  Foreign observers fear that if Grillo comes to power in an early election, he'll call a referendum to scrap the euro, go back to the Italian lira, and perhaps even follow Britain out of the European Union.  For Italy -- one of the original participants in the experiment in European unity -- to pull the plug on the EU would be fatal. With it, the European dream would die: borders would go up; the current -- albeit imperfect -- European economic order would evaporate. Sounds grim. But while the foreign media is alarmed about the prospect of a \"No\" victory, many Italians are surprisingly blasé about the potential consequences. \"Italy will not finish at all after this referendum,\" Massimo Franco, a columnist for the daily Corriere della Sera, recently reassured me with a chuckle, \"whatever the outcome.\" READ MORE: In 2017, France and Germany will split EuropePost-referendum apocalypseItalian law bans the publication of poll results in the final two weeks before any vote, but the last polls indicated that \"No\" is leading \"Si\" by at least 5% -- although nearly 15% of those who say they will vote are still undecided.The \"No\" camp spans the political spectrum, from the hard-right, anti-immigrant Lega Nord to the far left, with Grillo's amorphous anti-establishment Five Star Movement somewhere between the two. Giovanni, a skeptical neighbor who likes to keep a close eye on comings and goings on our street, told me \"Don't forget: tell everyone you know to vote 'No.'\" He is also a supporter of Donald Trump, and recently showed me a used book he bought at a flea market. \"L'Arte di Fare Affari\"—\"The Art of the Deal.\"When I asked him if he isn't worried about predictions of a post-referendum apocalypse, Giovanni makes a series of complicated hand gestures and bemused, dismissive grimaces. Another supporter of Trump is Matteo Salvini, leader of the virulently anti-migrant Lega Nord. I drove with Salvini in his camper van from one \"No\" event to another in northern Tuscany last week. Along the way, he boasted of his meeting with the now President-elect before the US election. \"The lesson of Trump tells us we must have courage,\" he told me. The Brexit vote and Trump's victory have put the wind into Salvini's sails, and he's hoping a \"No\" victory will propel his party closer to power.I met some of the \"Si\" crowd at a public meeting hosted by Renzi on Saturday in EUR, the Mussolini-era modernist suburb of Rome. \"It is my first time to vote,\" 18-year-old Francesco told me in surprisingly good English. \"And I'm going to vote yes, to improve our country to make it similar to other European democracies.\" \"We have to change. It's enough,\" said Stefania, a woman of a certain age who repeatedly referred to Prime Minister Renzi as a \"bravo ragazzo\" -- a \"good boy.\" READ MORE: Europe follows Trump to the rightOnce-in-a-lifetime chanceThe \"bravo ragazzo\" certainly sounded convincing while making his case for \"Si.\" The chance for real change, Renzi said, is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \"Yes or never. This needs to be clear. There will not be another chance.\" But the Italian people are nothing if not jaded. They greet grand promises with smirks and great projects with a shrug. Wearing a blue baseball cap emblazoned with a big \"No,\" unemployed construction worker Galileo Pasquale cheered the Lega Nord's Matteo Salvini at a rally in the quaint Tuscan town of Camaiore. He is voting \"No\" because he doesn't like Prime Minister Renzi and wants him to go. But, I asked him, if Italy has had 65 governments since World War II, why do you expect number 66 to be any different? Good question, he replied with a laugh: \"Umpteen governments have left us up to our necks in s***.\" Pasquale is hoping that someone will yank Italy out of it, but he's not looking at politics-as-usual to do so.Ben Wedeman is CNN's Rome-based senior international correspondent.

{"_id":"First US service member killed in Syria","articleText":" (CNN)A US service member was killed in northern Syria Thursday from wounds sustained in a blast from an improvised explosive device, according to the US-led coalition fighting ISIS.This marks the first time a US service member has been killed inside Syria since a small number of US Special Forces were sent there last year to advise and assist Syrian forces battling ISIS, also known as ISIL.\"The entire counter-ISIL coaltion sends our condolences to this hero's family, friends and teammates,\" Lt. Gen. Stephen J.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other top defense officials have said operations to retake the city from ISIS would begin in the near term, as the battle against ISIS in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul is already underway.An estimated 300 US Special Forces are currently operating in Syria advising the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is made up of a number of local militias, including the Kurdish YPG.Beyond the death Thursday, four US service members have been killed in Iraq since military options to dislodge ISIS from both countries began in 2014.\"I am deeply saddened by the news on this Thanksgiving Day that one of our brave service members has been killed in Syria while protecting us from the evil\" of ISIS, Carter said in a separate statement Thursday.  \"It is a painful reminder of the dangers our men and women in uniform face around the world to keep us safe,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/politics/us-service-member-killed-in-syria/index.html"}
{"_id":"Five ways to avoid germs while traveling ","articleText":"This story was originally published on CNN.com in 2008.  (CNN)This week, while you're traveling, if you happen to spot a man applying hand sanitizer as he gets off an escalator, there's a good chance it's Dr. Mark Gendreau, a senior staff physician at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts.Gendreau studies germiness while traveling, and he knows just how infectious travel can be.\"The risk of contracting a contagious illness is heightened when we travel within any enclosed space, especially during the winter months, when most of the respiratory viruses thrive,\" Gendreau said.Studies show that germs can travel easily on an airplane, where people are packed together like sardines. For example, a woman on a 1994 flight from Chicago to Honolulu transmitted drug-resistant tuberculosis to at least six of her fellow passengers, according to a New England Journal of Medicine study. In 2003, 22 people came down with severe acute respiratory syndrome from a single fellow passenger who had SARS but didn't have any symptoms, according to another New England journal study.But the airplane isn't the only place along your travel route where germs thrive. Here are five ways to avoid germs while traveling.1. Sit toward the front of the airplane.\"Pick a seat near the front, since ventilation systems on most commercial aircraft provide better air flow in the front of the aircraft,\" Gendreau advised. If you can afford it, sit in first class, where people aren't so squished together.2. Don't drink coffee or tea on an airplane.Monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that water in airplanes' water tanks isn't always clean -- and coffee and tea are usually made from that water, not from bottled water, according to Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association.The EPA advises anyone with a suppressed immune system or anyone who's \"concerned\" about bacteria to refrain from drinking coffee or tea on an airplane. \"While boiling water for one minute will remove pathogens from drinking water, the water used to prepare coffee and tea aboard a plane is not generally brought to a sufficiently high temperature to guarantee that pathogens are killed,\" according to the EPA's website.According to the EPA, out of 7,812 water samples taken from 2,316 aircraft, 2.8% were positive for coliform bacteria. Although that sounds like a small number, this means 222 samples contained coliform bacteria.3. Sanitize your hands after leaving an airplane bathroom.A toilet on an airplane \"is among the germiest that you will encounter almost anywhere,\" said Charles Gerba, an environmental microbiologist at the University of Arizona who's also known as \"Dr. Germ.\"\"You have 50 people per toilet, unless you are flying a discount airline; then it is 75,\" Gerba said. \"We always find E. coli on surfaces in airplane restrooms.\"You should wash your hands after using the restroom, but because the water itself might have harmful bacteria (see No. 2 above) and because the door handle on your way out has been touched by all those who went before you, Gendreau also advises sanitizing your hands when you return to your seat.4. Wash or sanitize your hands after getting off an escalator.Gendreau says tests show that escalators in airports are full of germs.To confirm these tests, here's a fun activity while you wait for your flight this Thanksgiving: Look at your watch, and count how many people get an escalator in a five-minute time period. Multiply that by 12, and you have how many people are on that escalator every hour.High-volume handrails are why Gendreau sanitizes his hands as soon as he can after he exits an escalator.5. Wash or sanitize your hands after using an ATM.Gendreau says ATMs, especially in busy places like airports, are full of germs. As with escalators, he sanitizes ASAP after using one.Gendreau says that keeping healthy while traveling can be summed up in six words: \"hand hygiene, hand hygiene, hand hygiene.\"  Keeping your hands clean is crucial, he says, when you're spending the day touching surfaces that have been touched by hundreds or thousands of people before you.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/avoid-germs-while-traveling/index.html"}
{"_id":"Five yoga strategies to stress less","articleText":"Dana Santas is a certified strength and conditioning specialist, experienced registered yoga teacher and mind-body coach known as the Mobility Maker. She's the yoga coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Lightning and others in Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional Golfers' Association. (CNN)After dealing with months of stress-inducing election drama, many of us are feeling understandably tense and anxious -- myself included. That's why I'm sharing five of my favorite yoga-based ways to tame  tension and regain peace of mind.Because stress takes its toll both mentally and physically, yoga's mind-body approach can be very effective at reducing its impact. As a widely recognized stress-relieving practice, yoga has been shown to mitigate the body's physiological response to stressors. Its primary effectiveness is based on helping practitioners switch from their sympathetic \"fight or flight\" nervous system to their parasympathetic \"rest and restore\" nervous system. The following five strategies offer ways to leverage yoga's ability to calm the nervous system as well release physical tension and emotional unease. If you're looking to tame tension and find peace, give them a try. Practice a peaceful pause.When you notice yourself reacting to a stressor, like a negative news story or an overly opinionated friend or neighbor, it's helpful to have a means of regaining your sense of peace and composure. Practicing yoga breathing and mindfulness meditation have both been proven to dramatically reduce mental and physical stress; mindfulness meditation was even recently shown to relieve chronic back pain. The simplest way to meditate is by focusing on your breath. As the only aspect of our autonomic nervous system that we can control, breathing is truly a stress-busting superpower that grants us access to the physiological processes that make us feel stressed. According to Harvard Medical School's Dr. Herbert Benson, we can use our breathing to elicit a \"relaxation response,\" lowering heart rate, blood pressure and stress-hormone production. To put this into practice, sit comfortably with your eyes closed and focus on your breathing. Establish a count as follows: five-count inhale, seven-count exhale and three-count pause. Take a minimum of 10 breaths in this manner, but ideally, try to build up to four sets of 10 breaths. This should take about 10 minutes.  Roll stress off your shoulders.Emotional stress manifests as physical stress, especially in the neck and shoulders. To release upper-body tension, from standing, clasp your hands behind your back and straighten your arms to the best of your ability as you look up, opening your chest, neck and shoulders. Hold the posture for a few breaths. Release and repeat. You can also shrug off shoulder and neck stress with some shoulder rolls and gentle head turns, like you are shaking your head \"no\" slowly. Think: stress -- no, no! Twist away tension.Because muscles work in chains, tension that starts in one area can quickly spread throughout our bodies, especially in our backs and hips. That's why I like to use a kneeling lunge twist that does double duty, twisting away back tension while releasing hip flexors (the muscles of the front of the hips). To do the posture, start in a kneeling lunge with your right leg forward and left knee down, with your left toes curled under. Place your left hand on the outside of your right thigh. Rotate your straight right arm behind you with your palm facing up. Turn your head to follow your right arm. Draw your right shoulder blade down to keep your shoulder from lifting and neck muscles off. Take three long, deep breaths. Repeat on the other side. If balance is an issue, begin with the left side of your body braced against a wall, so you can lean into it when needed. For added comfort, place a folded towel or mat under your back knee. Strike a power pose.Stress-induced anxiety can leave us feeling powerless. But research says you can pose your way back to a sense of power. Although its physiological effects are questionable, research still showed that a majority of participants reported feelings of power while holding an expansive pose. So, regardless of the hormonal impact, if you want to feel powerful, strike an open-body power pose by standing with your arms overhead or outstretched or, even better, with your hands on your hips like Wonder Woman or Superman. For an added sense of power, add a mantra or positive affirmation to your pose. Try one of these phrases that promote feelings of power: \"I am confident\" or \"I feel strong.\" Repeat it out loud several times or simply concentrate on it for a moment while you hold your power pose. Unplug, rest and recharge.One of the most important strategies for easing stress is to give our bodies and minds time to recover. There's no substitute for a solid night's rest, but sometimes even a short midday nap or 10 minutes lying down comfortably -- even if you're not sleeping or meditating -- can offer a profound recharge. We spend so much time \"plugged in,\" receiving a constant influx of news and messages, that any time we can spend unplugged is worthwhile. Lie down comfortably with a bolster or pillow under your legs and set a timer for a desired length of time; eight to 10 minutes is a good starting point. Make sure you are in a different room than your electronic devices, and they're set to \"do not disturb\" or turned off. Close your eyes. Notice your breathing and the sense of release and comfort in your legs as they rest on the bolster. If you'd like, you can focus on breathing exercises or meditation, but don't pressure on yourself do so. Try simply being comfortable and content. Allow yourself to think, but don't let yourself take any action on your thoughts; no checking your phone or writing anything down! Remain committed to simply being in your body in your relaxed posture for your designated amount of time, resting and recharging.

{"_id":"Florence Henderson, TV's Carol Brady, dies at 82","articleText":" (CNN)She was one of America's moms, a television icon that endured through generations. Florence Henderson, who played Carol Brady on \"The Brady Bunch,\" died Thursday from heart failure at the age of 82.Her death was unexpected. Henderson had not been sick, her manager, Kayla Pressman, said. Just this week, Henderson attended a taping of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" to cheer on Maureen McCormick, who played her TV daughter Marcia Brady.Henderson had made some TV and movie appearances this year.\"We are all in a state of shock,\" said Pressman, who spoke with the actress Wednesday night. Henderson died in a Los Angeles hospital, surrounded by family and friends.  A TV iconHenderson played Carol Brady from 1969 to 1974 on \"The Brady Bunch,\" a show that became a huge hit in syndication.\"The Brady Bunch\" was a story about a lovely lady and a man named Brady, a widow and widower with three children each.Even 40 years later, parts of the show are still staples of pop culture: The upbeat theme song and Rubik's cube-style opening, \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,\" the football moment and of course, Henderson herself -- with her big blue eyes and signature blonde coiffure. Her former castmates expressed their shock and grief at her passing. \"Florence Henderson was a dear friend for so very many years & in my <3 forever. Love & hugs to her family. I'll miss u dearly #RIPFlorence,\" tweeted Maureen McCormick, whom Henderson had seen just days before her death. Barry Williams, who played Greg Brady, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin that people ask him whether Henderson was really that nice, really that giving, really that maternal.Yes, he said.\"She took what she did very, very seriously,\" Williams said Friday. \"She was very gracious, always. She was an inspiration with how to conduct yourself in public as a famous person. She was so kind and would always take time. I want to remind people that -- and there are many many of us that will miss her -- that she was a genuine person.\"From the beginning, to Broadway, to Brady Henderson's life story wasn't as ideal as the one she was a part of on TV. She grew up poor in Indiana, with an alcoholic father and a mother who left when she was 12 years old. She was a talented singer, and would use her voice to entertain the family and help make ends meet. \"I don't ever remember not singing. And I would sing and pass the hat, and I would sing for groceries,\" she told the Archive of American Television in 1999.Her big break came in 1951 when she was offered a starring role in the musical \"Oklahoma!\"  Her voice carried her to a successful Broadway career, and eventually she began landing high-profile television gigs. In 1959, she was on set as an NBC \"Today Girl,\" and in 1962, she became the first woman to guest host the \"Tonight Show.\"Henderson became Carol Brady in 1969.\"I created the kind of mother that I wished I'd had, and I think everyone longs for,\" she said.Henderson married her first husband, Ira Bernstein, in 1955, and had her first child, Barbara, in 1956. The fact that she was a young wife and mother helped her bring the role of Carol Brady to life. \"I understood kids. I was close to them,\" she said in the 1999 AAT interview. \"I was the only one on the set who was married.\"Henderson had four children with Bernstein. They were married for 29 years.In 1987, she married John Kappas, a hypnotherapist. He died in 2002.An enduring figureWhen \"The Brady Bunch\" ended, Henderson continued to be a figure on screen and on the stage. She stuck with her musical career for a while, reviving her role as Annie Oakley in \"Annie Get Your Gun\" in 1981. And, of course, she brought back Carol Brady for numerous \"Brady Bunch\" spinoffs and specials.As the decades passed, she continued to be a presence through cameos and guest appearances. She showed up on \"Murder She Wrote,\" \"Ellen,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"30 Rock,\" and curiously, as a guest host on \"WWE Raw\" in 2010.  She dabbled in movies, appearing in \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" and most recently, \"50 Shades of Black.\" She also had a fondness for game show appearances, delighting audiences on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\" \"The  $100,000 Pyramid\" and \"Dancing with the Stars.\"Remembering America's mom Stars from all genres paused their Thanksgiving festivities to honor their colleague and friend. \"It was a true honor to have known and worked with her,\" wrote Al Yankovic. \"[She] was a doll and a dame and funny as hell,\" wrote actor Michael McKean.

{"_id":"For 'Lion,' Dev Patel took his mind and body to new places","articleText":" (CNN)Dev Patel admits he was a \"puddle of tears\" the first time he read the script for his upcoming film \"Lion.\" Once moviegoers get a chance to see the film for themselves, they'll understand why. The movie chronicles the true story of Saroo Brierley, a man who searches for the birth mother and family he was separated from when he was a young boy living in India. To do this, Saroo (Patel) attempts to find his home town via Google Earth from Australia, where he was raised after being adopted. If that sounds like a daunting task, it's because it is. Saroo pushes himself to the emotional brink in hopes of finding the life he only recalls through a 5-year-old's eyes. \"[I was] just astounded that these words I'm saying, this journey that I've just read is real,\" Patel told CNN of reading the script for the first time. \"It's just so incredible. It's a feat of humanity, of what he achieved.\" Preparing for the role was an 8-month process for Patel, arguably best known for his work in 2008's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"The Newsroom.\" He had to learn an Australian accent and also set out to bulk up his frame. He hit the gym at director Garth Davis' request, who wanted to show Patel as he'd never been seen before. \"We spoke about the look and growing the hair and going to the gym and getting a bit more Aussie, a little more Alpha,\" Patel said. \"Eating a bit more food.\" Seemingly the hardest aspect of prep work had nothing to do with his physical form.  Davis had the cast do significant work on what Patel calls \"introspection.\" Patel was asked to keep a diary and at one point was asked to sit alone in front of the mirror for an hour looking at his reflection. \"All sorts of crazy stuff,\" Patel said. Then there was his visit to the Indian orphanage at which the real-life Saroo once lived. Patel recalled being greeted by a message written in flowers on the floor: \"Welcome Lion.\" As he walked around, Patel said the kids would call him \"hero,\" referring to his role in the film. That, he admits, made him feel \"like a fake.\" \"You're like, 'I'm not the hero. You're the heroes,'\" he said.  \"The one I went to, [some children] are severely disabled, suffering from all sorts of muscular dystrophy and things like that and in so much pain. And the staff, a lot of them are volunteers.\" Patel wrote about the visit in his assigned diary, he said.   \"You see in an environment like India where there is a lot of chaos and madness, these beacons of positivity and hope,\" he recalled. \"It's amazing.\" \"Lion\" opens in theaters November 25. Patel hopes the themes of family and unity come through. \"Everyone keeps saying you want to call your friends or your sister or your mother after this,\" he said. \"And that's the message we should be putting out in to the world, especially at this time.\" ","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/entertainment/dev-patel-lion-movie/index.html"}

{"_id":"France is paying the price for normalizing Islamophobia","articleText":"Aurélien Mondon is a senior lecturer in French and comparative politics at Bath University, studying racism, populism, the far right and the crisis of democracy (CNN)Nicolas Sarkozy's defeat in the French Republican primary Sunday night could mean a reshuffling of priorities on the center right of French politics.The race will now be between two former prime ministers, Alain Juppe and Francois Fillon, and the winner will then have to lead the mainstream right in what is set to be a decisive moment for France next year.Fillon's decisive and surprising victory in the first round could demonstrate that Juppé's more conciliatory tone has failed. With over 44% of the vote, Fillon may appear to many as a moderate compared to Sarkozy, but his neoliberal views -- coupled with a very conservative approach to societal matters, particularly with regard to identity, immigration and Islam -- should allow him to tap into the electorate of his defeated opponents. It was a strong sign that Sarkozy announced he would vote for Fillon as he conceded.As France struggles to escape the woes of the global economic crisis, with growth failing to reach predictions and unemployment remaining high, much of the coverage of the campaign so far has given prominence to the far-right Front National party and its leader, Marine Le Pen.After shocking victories by pro-Brexit forces and US President-elect Donald Trump, Le Pen seems emboldened, and the media's willingness to follow her lead will without a doubt make immigration and Islam central to next year's campaign. This will be compounded by the governing Socialist Party's failure to reject the politics of identity.This shift towards fantasies of a pure French (even Gaulish) identity being threatened has been made more prominent by recent attacks, as terrorists have fueled a deep sense of insecurity and distrust within the French population.This toxic atmosphere has been compounded and normalized by politicians reacting disproportionately to the attacks, calling for war against enemies from without and within. Stance on burkini bansThe burkini bans this summer exemplified the lack of an alternative -- beyond stigmatization and exclusion -- that politicians are willing to put forward in France.After being implemented in 31 towns, the bans on modest swimsuits worn by Muslim women were eventually suspended by the State Council, who claimed that such laws \"constituted a serious and manifestly illegal infringement of fundamental liberties.\" The council also reminded mayors that the law \"may only restrict freedoms if there are confirmed risks,\" something which clearly was not the case.Despite such strong advice, and a similar condemnation by the UN Human Rights high commissioner, politicians on both the left and right have jockeyed to show who is toughest when it comes to legislating over the rights of women's bodies, particularly those from already stigmatized minorities. Sarkozy went the furthest, demanding that the constitution be changed to ban the swimsuits.Fillon offered his support to the mayors who had passed burkini-ban laws, while Prime Minister Manuel Valls continued to criticise the burkini, stating that wilfully vilifying that piece of clothing was in no way attacking personal freedom. Juppé took a more moderate approach, criticizing the law and the polemics surrounding it. His efforts to appease tensions may have reassured left-wing voters, but they failed to win over his own camp.Following public opinion?Such extreme reactions have not been targeting only the Muslim communities in France. They also have been aimed at migrants, as the recent debate over an infamous Calais migrant camp demonstrated. In all cases, politicians defended their tough anti-immigrant stance on the basis that that they were merely following public opinion.However, a recent survey by Eurobarometer suggests this is not the case. When asked, \"What do you think are the two most important issues facing France at the moment?\" respondents ranked unemployment first (51.8%), followed by terrorism (30%, up from 13% in 2015). Immigration came fourth with 13.7%. When the same respondents were asked \"And personally, what are the two most important issues you are facing at the moment?\" rising prices/inflation came first (32.5%), followed by pensions (15.1%), taxation (14.4%) and unemployment (14%). Terrorism (7.2%) and immigration (3.8%) were respectively 13th and 15th.Paying the price The hype created around such hot topics by the media and politicians does not only distract the electorate from other concerns. It also legitimizes a type of discourse that had long been marginalized. In France, this race to the bottom within the mainstream has allowed Le Pen and the Front National to take the back seat. At the FN summer conference, Le Pen posited herself as the \"normal\" candidate, more moderate than many of her mainstream counterparts.However, it would be wrong to assume that this normalization of Islamophobia in France is simply the result of a panicked reaction from politicians following deeply traumatic events. The recent explosion of Islamophobia in mainstream political discourse is the result of decades of stigmatization towards Muslim communities in France, starting with the hijab affair in the late 1980s.The rise of simplistic exclusionary speech towards a diverse part of the population has been in part facilitated by the conscious misuses of the term laïcité. The word has traditionally protected freedom of religion while preventing interference from the state. But politicians have twisted its connotations into a tool for general stigmatization and exclusion.Islam has become the perfect scapegoat for French politicians who claim Muslims' incompatibility with \"our\" ways -- no matter how unclear these are -- became no longer a question of race but of culture and religion. But the end point is similar, and what has been called \"new racism\" is in fact very much still racism.As I have explained at length elsewhere, \"Muslimness\" in this \"new racism\" is defined by the onlooker in a position of power, not the bearer of the identity, and is imposed onto people through generalization, misperception and stigmatization made ubiquitous by public discourse and repetition.Sexism, violence and other generalizations become problems described as being located within the so-called \"Muslim community.\" This in turn justifies subjugating a minority to special and often violent treatment. And it prevents us from looking at the more systemic shortcomings of our societies in terms of gender violence and other forms of inequality and injustice.Dystopia as the new norm?Such a diversion has proven a blessing for mainstream politicians as they have failed to offer their people (including the minorities they willfully stigmatize) more hopeful avenues for politics. Dystopia has become the new norm.With less than six months to go before the first round of the French presidential election, it seems that none of the mainstream candidates are willing to denounce Islamophobia in all its forms. While Juppé has taken a more conciliatory approach, his underwhelming performance in the first round of the Républicans' primaries could spur a tougher approach in the coming week.While the situation is particularly worrying for minorities in France, polls revealing incredible levels of political dissatisfaction could point to a different future (up to 9 out of 10 respondents to the Eurobarometer survey say they don't trust political parties). While Brexit and Trump's successful campaigns did indeed capitalize on far-right sentiments, both did little to sufficiently address the more important economic issues that concern the electorate.While the far right has so far managed to tap into this resentment most successfully, at least in appearance, a progressive and inclusive alternative could turn the tide, as mainstream parties have proven their inability to retain or win back voters even when faced with an unpalatable alternative.The question for the French people who believe in a different future than that offered by the FN is thus both simple and impossibly complicated: Can they wait for traditional parties to provide such an alternative, or should they take matters into their own hands?

{"_id":"France's presidential election: Who is Alain Juppe?","articleText":" (CNN)Alain Juppe's chances of becoming France's next president appeared a lot more likely a week ago.The 71-year-old had been tipped to win the Republican Party's first-round presidential nominations -- but instead came second to Francois Fillon. The veteran politicians, both former prime ministers, will now go head-to-head in a final vote for the party's nomination on November 27. Third-placed former President Nicolas Sarkozy meanwhile, was knocked out of the race altogether.Juppe secured just over 28% of the vote in the first round, and is still seen as an experienced politician in the running for the center-right party's presidential candidacy. Because of the unpopularity of President Francois Hollande's socialist party, whoever is named the Republican nominee will likely complete against the leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen for the presidency in April next year.READ MORE: Who is Juppe's opponent, Francois Fillon?Juppe the moderateJuppe is the current mayor of Bordeaux who also served as prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under President Jacques Chirac.He's considered a moderate who promises to promote a \"happy national identity\" if he comes to power.In 2004, Juppe was found guilty of corruption and originally sentenced to 18 months in prison and barred from holding public office for a decade -- later reduced to 14 months imprisonment and one year of ineligibility.While deputy mayor of Paris in charge of finance in the 1980s and 1990s, Juppe was accused of using public funds to pay political allies.The father-of-three lives in the Bordeaux region with his journalist wife Isabelle Legrand-Bodin.What does he stand for?In a nutshell: He has promised economic reform, effective border control within and outside Europe, an end to the 35-hour work week, and more investment in security and the fight against terrorism.Critical of Russia: While Juppe has not opposed discussions with Moscow, he has been critical of Russia's alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the bombing of Aleppo. Juppe is also opposed to French military intervention on the ground in Syria.Supports longer working hours: Juppe wants to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65, and increase the working week from 35 hours to 39. Against burkini ban: \"Juppe was against the burkini ban which was quite rare on the right side of politics at the time, and I think that will play against him in the Republican primaries,\" said Aurelien Mondon, senior lecturer in French politics at Bath University.Unification: \"The broad message Juppe is trying to get across is a moderate, unified, appeased France,\" said Mondon. \"It's a lot less 'angry politics' than we have today and you can see in the Trump and Brexit campaigns.\"Could he be France's next president?

","articleText":" (CNN)He's been called the \"French Thatcher\" for his apparent admiration of Britain's \"Iron Lady\" and willingness to tackle the unions.Now Francois Fillon is also the frontrunner for the Republican party's presidential nomination, having beaten a field of seven on Monday -- including his former boss and president Nicolas Sarkozy.Fillon served as Sarkozy's prime minister between 2007 and 2012.But any chance of a political comeback by Sarkozy came to an abrupt end after Fillon secured 44% of the center-right party's first-round vote, pushing Sarkozy into third place.Fillon will now compete against another former prime minister, Alain Juppe, in a second-round vote for the party's nomination on November 27.The winner could be up against the leader of the far-right Front National, Marine Le Pen, in the contest for the presidency in May next year.READ MORE: Who is Fillon's opponent, Alain Juppe?Mild mannered racing fanThe 62 year old lawyer-turned-politician grew up in a strict Catholic household in Sarthe, western France, to a notary father and history teacher mother.At the age of 27 Fillon was elected mayor of Sable, and worked his way up the political ladder to become Sarkozy's mild mannered prime minster in 2007.\"Sarkozy was such a big personality that I think a lot of people don't really know who Fillon is,\" said Aurelien Mondon, senior lecturer in French politics at Bath University.\"Indeed one thing that could work against Fillon is his lack of charisma.\"The father-of-five lives in a 12th century castle near where he grew up, with Welsh-born wife Penelope.He is also a race car enthusiast who once appeared on France's Top Gear TV program. What does he stand for?In a nutshell: Fillon aims to end the 35-hour work week, cut public spending, abolish the wealth tax, reduce immigration and invest 12 billion euros in security, defense and justice.Tough on unions: French newspaper Liberation morphed Fillon's face with Margaret Thatcher's in a terrifying front cover this week -- no doubt inspired by the Republican's admiration of Britain's former prime minister, his tough talk on unions, and pledge to cut 500,000 jobs from the civil service. Warmer on Russia: \"Fillon wants to renew links with Russia and has been praising Russian politicians lately,\" said Mondon, adding: \"It could put him in the same category as the populist right that is on the rise across Europe.\" Critical of same-sex marriage: In 2013 Fillon voted against same-sex marriage, which came into law under President François Hollande. \"Fillon comes from the Catholic conservative side and is supported by radical Catholic organizations -- particularly the ones who organized anti-gay marriage demonstrations three years ago,\" explained Mondon.Supported burkini ban: Fillon offered his support to the mayors who passed temporary burkini-bans over the summer. A court in Nice later suspended the city's ban.Why he could be France's next presidentJust a few weeks ago, Fillon was considered an unlikely bet for the presidency, but he won over voters with a polished performance in the TV debates.He apparently also struck the right tone on the fight against Islamist terrorism and ISIS after publishing a new book called \"Beating Islamic Totalitarianism.\"\"Until recently we thought it would be Juppe or Sarkozy against Marine Le Pen in the presidential election,\" said Mondon. \"Le Pen would have done a lot better against Juppe, who could have been seen to be too moderate, and Sarkozy, who could have been seen as a hypocrite for not doing enough as president in 2007.\"Fillon has the credentials that neither of the other Republicans do with the radical right -- so that will make it a lot more difficult for Le Pen to compete against.\"CNN's  Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report ","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/politics/francois-fillon-french-presidential-election/index.html"}
{"_id":"Free of ideology, Trump can get on with making deals","articleText":"Richard Galustian is a business and security analyst who has lived in Libya since 2011. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)In his election campaign, Donald Trump was lauded by fans -- and hammered by critics -- for saying out loud what many regular voters were thinking.From migration to economics, foreign policy to Hillary Clinton's emails, his blunt style won him fans and enemies in almost equal number. Those fans have now sent him to the White House.The experts, having predicted his certain failure, are now stumbling to predict how he will run the foreign policy of the only hyper-power in the world.The likely answer is the most obvious one: Trump, in office, is likely to be the same as Trump on the stump. Blunt. Forthright. Dedicated to one belief: banging America's drum. Using one method to achieve it: dealmaking.Many analysts see Trump's lack of political experience -- he will be the first US president to have served neither in politics or the military -- as a liability.But might it also be an asset? Might a dealmaker be just what a world engulfed in crisis needs?Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the greatest political dealmaker of modern times, certainly thinks so. Last week he described Trump as the \"most unique\" President-elect in his lifetime after meeting him. \"He has no obligation to any particular group because he has become president on the basis of his own strategy,\" he said.Lack of experience on the world stage was leveled when Ronald Reagan came to power, and his term of office saw one of America's greatest triumphs in the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union.Confucius said 500 years before the birth of Christianity that \"the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name,\" and Trump embraces this methodology with gusto. Indeed, an end to political correctness was his campaign cry, and probably won him the keys to the Oval Office. His big idea -- that a system choked by bureaucracy and the liberal media is broke -- got him to the White House.Free of ideology, of political baggage and of the trappings that go with it, Trump can look the world in the eye, his guiding principle outlined in his election cry: Make America Great Again.He has already made a start, declaring he will dismantle the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which many Americans say favors rich business leaders at the expense of tens of thousands of US jobs to be exported overseas.His words caused consternation with China, and if anyone doubts the United States is still the big boy on the world's economic block, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe rammed home the message, declaring in Peru on Monday, \"The TPP without the United States is meaningless.\"Trump's broader foreign policy is unknown but seems likely to be as blunt as his stump speeches.Russia? Cut a deal. Neither Moscow nor Washington needs tension in the Middle East or Europe to boil over, and neither directly threatens the other, so there is a deal to be made. Especially if they can find some way of getting a fix on the open wound that is Syria.The Chinese? Work with them, if they work with the United States.Iran? If the deal to lift sanctions in return for cutting Tehran's nukes works, keep it. If not, talk to them about a new deal.Europe? The same. If European nations pay a fair share for their common defense, America may -- may -- be open to a deal with European Union member states.What about Libya, which President Barack Obama has declared the greatest foreign policy mistake in his eight years in the White House?Mahmoud Jibril, former Prime Minister of the rebel administration that emerged in Libya's Arab Spring to combat Moammar Gadhafi, said the key to Libya, as with Syria, is learning to work with Russia: \"If Trump can reach some sort of rapprochement with Russia, then there is a likelihood some sort of transaction over various MENA (Middle East and North Africa) problems can be reached.\"And it will be reached with the blunt mind of a businessman. The United States has been backing Libya's unelected, unpopular Government of National Accord, which has failed to become either a government, or find accord in a country convulsed in violence.A Trump view may be that, if it cannot command the respect of Libyans or bring peace, what is America doing supporting it? Why not find other groups to knit together a peace that would leave one less global headache for the United States to worry about.Trump's dealmaking, echoing that of Kissinger, can personify a spirit of realpolitik in the 21st century, using politically unorthodox skills that get the job done.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/opinions/trump-political-baggage-deal-opinion-galustian/index.html"}
{"_id":"French Interior Minister Cazeneuve appointed prime minister","articleText":"Paris (CNN)French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has been appointed prime minister, the Elysee Palace said Tuesday, after Manuel Valls stepped down from the role to launch a presidential bid. Valls, 54, announced Monday he would put himself in the running to become the Socialist Party candidate for next year's presidential poll and will have to go through primary elections to win the party nomination.Cazeneuve, 53, is best known for overseeing the nation's security forces in response to a spate of terror attacks that hit the country, killing 229 people in two years. The deadliest were the Paris attacks last year that left 130 people dead. Cazeneuve is a trained lawyer but has had a long political career. In 1991 he became a councilor in the Cabinet of Thierry de Beaucé, then the secretary of state for international cultural relations, according to his biography on the Interior Ministry website. He was elected a member of parliament in 1997 and has since served as minister of state for European affairs and minister of state for the budget, before being appointed interior minister.Valls' resignation has given way to a Cabinet shake-up, with Bruno Le Roux, a ranking socialist in the French National Assembly, nominated as interior minister in Cazeneuve's place.If Valls wins the Socialist nomination, he will likely face Francois Fillon of the Republican Party and Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National in the first round of the presidential election next spring.The race beginsPresident Francois Hollande of the same party announced Thursday last week that he would not seek a second term as his popularity ratings plunge.It is the first time since 1958, when France's fifth republic was created, that an incumbent president has not sought reelection.Hollande cited achievements under his watch, including opening up marriage to all couples, strengthening women's equality and fighting against discrimination.He said unemployment had declined since the beginning of the year, but conceded \"it remains at too high a level.\"Valls who has also previously served as interior minister, said on Monday that he wanted an independent France \"inflexible on its values, when facing Xi Jinping's China, Putin's Russia, Donald Trump's America, Erdogan's Turkey,\" referring to the leaders of those countries.  Fillon, 62, was elected the Republican Party candidate in primary elections. He has been dubbed a \"French Thatcher\" for his apparent admiration for Britain's \"Iron Lady,\" Margaret Thatcher. A lawyer who served as prime minister between 2007 and 2012 under Nicolas Sarkozy, Fillon has talked of ending France's famed 35-hour work week and getting tough with the country's powerful trade unions. A hard line on immigration has also bolstered Le Pen, whose anti-Europe stance is gaining popularity among French voters.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/europe/france-prime-minister-cazeneuve/index.html"}
{"_id":"From Snickers to Pat Benatar: A rabbit convention in Oregon","articleText":" (CNN)Last year, Katya Rezvaya went to a rabbit-breeders convention in Portland, Oregon. But unlike most there, she went with cameras in hand, not rabbits. In fact, she doesn't even have a rabbit. She has always liked them, though, and after watching a documentary called \"Rabbit Fever,\" she was amazed at how grand in scale the rabbit breeding community is.The documentary showcases a national convention held by the American Rabbit Breeders Association, whose annual event brings together more than 20,000 rabbits as they compete for prizes. Rezvaya wanted to learn about the kinds of people she saw in \"Rabbit Fever,\" and she thought she'd go to one of the conventions and make portraits of the people there.\"My impression was, 'Oh my God, so many rabbits,' \" Rezvaya recalled. \"I don't know what I was expecting when I was going there, because this idea was totally unpredictable.\"The convention was held in a big expo center, where Rezvaya set up a studio. She started by simply approaching people she was interested in photographing. But as the five-day event progressed, people heard about the woman making portraits, and they started to approach her.\"What was interesting for me is that, for this convention, I really felt that there were people from all over America,\" Rezvaya said. She was also amused by some of the names people gave their rabbits -- names like Snickers, Captain Adorable and Pat Benatar.One rabbit breed, Dwarf Hotots, look like they're wearing black eyeliner because of the ring of black fur around their eyes. So Peyton Brackenbury, 12, named hers by eyeliner brands such as Maybelline and Unique.There are many different rabbit breeds that vary in size, shape and color. Marcus Rhoden's fluffy Felicia, in photo No. 10, is an English Angora.\"There was a section in the building with this breed,\" Rezvaya said. \"There were a lot of people ... they were always busy with their rabbits because they always had to brush them or something.\"There were some really large rabbits, too. Daniel and Susan Hathaway's furry friends Defiance and Enterprise -- in the fourth photo above -- each weigh about 16 pounds. They're Flemish Giants, one of the largest rabbit breeds.\"Susan is a really, really small woman and the rabbit is about 7 kilograms (15.4 pounds). It's huge,\" Rezvaya said. \"She had to bring the rabbit on a cart to my place because it was like a 10-minute walk from one side of the building to another.\" Although she has never had a rabbit, Rezvaya says if she were to get one, she would probably get a Dwarf Hotot like little Ozwald in photo No. 11. \"They are really cute,\" she said.Rezvaya calls her photo series \"Oh My Rabbits\" and feels portraits were the best and most enjoyable way for her to find out more about the rabbit-breeding community. Her photographs capture just how diverse the community is. \"I can't even say something particular about who rabbit breeders are,\" she said.Katya Rezvaya is a photographer based in St. Petersburg, Russia.

{"_id":"From homeless to high school grad bound for college","articleText":" (CNN)Liyjon DeSilva had a secret.He kept it at night, when he could see the stars in the sky as he went to bed in a parking lot. He kept it during the day, when he attended classes at Lee High School in Houston.DeSilva at first didn't tell school administrators and teachers that he had been homeless for three years -- since he was 15 -- after he bounced around different relatives' homes. His mom died when he was 5 and he grew up in poverty.But when a school social worker began to break the ice, DeSilva's life took a turn. The student, who slept on buses and in parks, had been struggling to stay in the school and was unable to come up with residency documents.\"I didn't trust her at first. I thought she was with the school trying to ask why I had missing documents, but she kept chasing me just trying to figure out what was going on and how she could help. Once I finally opened up to her, things started to change for the better,\" said DeSilva.Better indeed.The student, now 20, flourished and graduated in late May among the top of his class. He won a full scholarship to Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. Classes start in mid-September.Jessica Smith, who works as a project manager with the nonprofit Communities in Schools, a dropout prevention organization, pushed for DeSilva to be allowed to stay in the school and get his diploma. She got the support of fellow teachers and Principal Jonathan Trinh.\"When we first met, I knew he was an amazing, bright college-bound kid,\" Smith told CNN. \"I see this type of stuff every day, and all it takes is one person to help these kids make a better future for themselves.... I knew I had to do that for him,\" said Smith.Trinh reached into his own pocket to pay for DeSilva to live in an extended-stay hotel for 30 days and Smith turned to social media to ask friends to put the student up as he completed his studies. \"Everyone needs help. Everyone needs love,\" DeSilva told the Houston Independent School District in a video about his accomplishments.The graduate's story begins in New Orleans' Ninth Ward, where he grew up poor. He lived in several locations with relatives. At 14, he said, he was sent to briefly live in Africa because his father didn't want to care for him.Once his visa expired, he moved to Houston to live with his cousins. He said they made him quit school and get a job. \"When I started questioning them on where my money was going they got angry, called me disrespectful and kicked me out. I only needed the money for new clothes and food. Everything I had was old and worn out,\" DeSilva said.So at 15, he found himself alone. But DeSilva believed the experience was preparing him for something greater.\"I wanted to be able to live like a normal kid. But I slept at parks. My favorite was sleeping in parking lots because I could see the stars in the sky,\" DeSilva told CNN.At Lee High School, he slowly began to trust people trying to help him. Now, DeSilva considers Smith and Trinh to be mother and father figures.\"Once he (DeSilva) was able to recollect himself, he began to blossom,\" Smith said. \"He didn't have to worry about his safety and was able to sleep and eat in a warm environment. He was finally able to be a normal teenager.\"On May 27, DeSilva graduated among the top of his class with a 3.67 GPA. The Posse Foundation provided him a full scholarship for college, said Eric Sieger, director of media relations at Carleton College, a small, private liberal arts school.Smith started a crowdfunding site to raise money so that the graduate can cover transportation costs to college, buy a laptop and furnish his dorm. And he could use some warm clothes for the harsh Minnesota winters. So far, $23,000 has been raised.DeSilva feels blessed.\"With my type of life, I thought I would die,\" he said. \"But, I wasn't going to let my situation hold me back. I always wanted a purpose and I feel like I have found it. Once I won the scholarship I truly realized I can do this. My impossible turned into 'I'm possible.'\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/us/texas-student-who-was-homeless-going-college/index.html"}

{"_id":"Game shows that ability to navigate declines at young age","articleText":"Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN)A mobile game has revealed the navigational skills of people around the world in a bid to develop an accurate test for dementia.The smartphone game, called \"Sea Hero Quest,\" asks players to set sail on a global adventure in search of precious artifacts -- in the form of memories -- which can be collected at different locations around the world. As you progress through the game, scientists can use the data you generate to gain insight into your navigational abilities, which is one of the first skills people lose during the onset of dementia.Initial results, presented at the Neuroscience 2016 conference in San Diego on Wednesday, found that our navigational skills deteriorate from early adulthood and for the rest of our lives, not just in older age, as previously thought.More than 2.4 million people have played the game since its launch in May, generating the equivalent of more than 9,000 years of lab data. In addition to new insight into our navigational decline, the data revealed differences in spatial navigation abilities between genders as well as countries, with Nordic countries coming out on top.The goal was to identify the normal range of navigation skills among humans in general, throughout the world, and to then use this to develop a test or chart to profile people and spot dementia early through any deviance from the norm. \"This is the only study of its kind, on this scale, to date. Its accuracy greatly exceeds that of all previous research in this area,\" said Hugo Spiers, a neuroscientist at University College London, who led the research stemming from the game's data.\"The findings the game is yielding have enormous potential to support vital developments in dementia research,\" he said in a statement.Deviating from the normThe main finding from the game to date was the discovery that our ability to navigate declines as young as 19, which was the age when researchers began sampling, and continues to do so throughout life. This was highlighted by results from one particular aspect of the game in which gamers are spontaneously asked to shoot a flare in the direction they came from.  Nineteen-year-old users were 74% more likely to shoot the flare accurately on average, but by the age of 75, this had been cut to 46%. \"We expected it to plateau, maybe in our 60s, but it was actually throughout our lifespan,\" Spiers told CNN.Men performed this particular task 10% better than women, according to Spiers, but the researchers think this may be down to differences in strategies, in terms of how each gender navigates the seas during the game as a whole -- to find and collect the memories as tasked.Another eye-opener was the differences in scores between countries. Some Nordic nations -- Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark -- were found to have notably better spatial navigation than participants from the other 189 countries.\"We're discovering some basic principles about humans,\" Spiers said, adding that this gender and cultural insight all feeds into identifying global norms and when people may be deviating from them due to dementia.How big a problem is dementia?Despite being potentially preventable in one-third of cases, it's estimated that someone develops dementia globally every three seconds. In 2015, more than 46 million people were living with dementia worldwide, according to the World Alzheimer Report 2015 (PDF).The condition is a collection of symptoms, such as memory loss, difficulties in thinking or problem-solving, and reduced ability to navigate. It is caused by diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\"Dementia is increasingly becoming one of the greatest medical challenges we face globally,\" said Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK.\"It is a disease you can prevent. ... It's not an inevitable part of aging.\"Despite the high numbers affected, an accurate test for the condition remains unavailable. But this could be about to change -- depending the next stages of data analyzed from \"Sea Hero Quest.\"\"(The game) can tell us, how do people get lost?\" Spiers said.\"Fundamentally, people with dementia -- Alzheimer's dementia -- struggle to navigate, and on a scientific level, we don't know enough of how people navigate to help really pin down what's going wrong,\" he said.Using global dataThe team has completed one round of its data analysis and will continue to reveal more insight as it comes. All data are anonymous and available only to researchers at University College London.\"Step one is establishing this live database of, how do people navigate? ... That gives us the tool to develop that diagnostic,\" said Spiers.The website that knows what doctors don't Next, researchers will test the game on people known to have Alzheimer's dementia to see whether they can identify any key differences in they subjects' spatial navigation.They then imagine a scenario in which people suffering from dementia can be identified early -- by playing the game -- and given relevant drugs to stop the disease taking full hold of their mind. \"You could give them (the game) and monitor if the drug is effective in a really powerful way,\" Spiers said.Next step: Brain imagingIn the next stages of the project, Spiers would also like to have volunteers play the game while having their brains scanned in order to see which parts are active and link this to patterns seen in the population worldwide.\"I hope to collect neuroimaging data from people playing this game to really understand how the circuits are activated as people play the game,\" he said.This is not the first use of mobile games to crowdsource data for scientists. Cancer Research UK has launched five games, including \"Play to Cure: Genes in Space\" in 2014, which obtained data as people traveled through space and helped identify codes and patterns along their way -- unwittingly.\"Sea Hero Quest\" became available on iOS and Android on May 4 and was created in a collaboration between Deutsche Telecom, Alzheimer's Research UK, scientists from University College London and the University of East Anglia, and game designers Glitchers.\"These new insights into how humans navigate have only come as a result of a new kind of collaboration in dementia research,\" Evans said. \"A health challenge as complex as dementia demands we approach studies innovatively.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/health/dementia-game-sea-hero-quest/index.html"}
{"_id":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel announces run for fourth term ","articleText":" (CNN)One of the world's most powerful leaders has announced her decision to run for office again.German Chancellor Angela Merkel put an end to months of speculation about her political future by saying she would seek a fourth term in next year's federal elections.\"I pondered a lot about it,\" Merkel told reporters at a news conference in Berlin. \"The decision for a fourth term after 11 years is anything ... (but) trivial, not for the country and not for the party, and I say it consciously also for me personally.\" Merkel, 62, said she expects the fall 2017 campaign to be her toughest to date. \"The coming election will be difficult,\" Merkel said. \"We will probably be criticized from everywhere, from the right-wing parties and also because of the polarization of our society, also from the left party.\"  Merkel alerted top members of her Christian Democrat Union party, or CDU, about her decision to run a few days ago. Another stint for Merkel would be significant because a large part of the German electorate is looking for stability in uncertain times after the Brexit vote in Britain, the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the rise of populist movements in several European countries.\"There is a lot of tension within the European Union given the Euro crisis, the question of refugees and the decision of Great Britain to exit from the European Union,\" Merkel acknowledged at the news conference. \"The situation in the world is as such that it needs to sort itself out again with regard also to the United States and Russia.\"Merkel has angered many voters with her decision to open Germany's borders to migrants, mostly from war zones in the Middle East. In September, her party suffered a significant defeat in local elections. The Chancellor has admitted she has made mistakes with the controversial refugee policy.\"There's a lot of criticism with her leadership with regard to her refugee policy and letting asylum seekers come to Germany,\" CNN political commentator Alice Stewart said Sunday.  \"There's also lot of uncertainty with regard to Brexit. But those two factors creating an uncertain environment, there could be a good play for her in showing stability.\" Merkel was elected Chancellor in 2005, becoming the country's first female leader. The daughter of a Protestant minister, she was brought up in communist East Germany. She entered Germany's parliament in the first post-unification election, serving in ministerial posts and as the leader of the opposition before becoming chancellor.  Visiting Berlin last week, President Barack Obama praised Merkel, who has voiced support for the US leader's priorities on climate change, Russian sanctions and economic reform.Merkel said she understood the world was looking at her as a source of stability but rejected the notion that she alone had a role in keeping liberalism alive. \"I'm honored in a way, but also I think it's grotesque and absurd,\" Merkel said. \"No human being on his own, even if there's a lots of experience, can manage to give the world a positive direction for everything, not even a German Chancellor.\" Merkel said she has a clear view of the challenges she faces and hopes to be a unifying figure. She said she wants to work for a cohesive society without hate. \"We together wish to argue like Democrats, that means arguing not (to) hate, not (to) degrade somebody, not (to) ostracize somebody, exclude somebody,\" Merkel said. \"I understand in politics that it's our mission as the state to try to solve problems for citizens, to give a framework where people can shape their lives.

{"_id":"Giant domes and airports in the sky: The New York that never was","articleText":"Daniel Libeskind is an architect, joint founder of Studio Daniel Libeskind and was CNN Style's first guest editor in July 2015. Below is his foreword to new book \"Never Built New York.\" (CNN)Architecture has always begun with drawing. Music, as we know, begins with a score. In this manner, both architecture and music have completed a work.Architectural drawings and musical scores live a life of perfect solitude even if in a drawer or an attic. Their future is yet to come.Strangely enough, people cannot conceive of architecture or music without a physical performance. One can build a building, and yet wind up without any architecture. One can make architecture in a drawing, yet never get to build. A composer may write a score, which may never be performed, but its lack of being performed does not disqualify it as a piece of music.Herein lies the paradox of unbuilt and unperformed works.They live their own existence, oblivious to time. The power of a drawing and its creative force does not lie merely in its use as a tool for practical purposes. It lies in the beholder's imagination. A drawing might lodge itself in the mind and build itself to great heights within it. Beethoven composed his last works without physically hearing them played. He heard them in his mind; in his being. So, too, architecture.The contents of architectural drawings, be they realized or not, can enter the imagination of the public. Drawings thereby inscribe themselves as projects: future actions. Just like music, an architectural drawing can wait a long time before revealing itself. Bach's scores lay for some 200 years, unplayed and unperformed, until Mendelssohn rediscovered them and made them public through performance.

{"_id":"Giant shield slides into place over Chernobyl's damaged reactor ","articleText":" (CNN)It can withstand a tornado and is so massive it could house Paris' famed Notre-Dame Cathedral.A giant shield designed to protect the nuclear reactor damaged 30 years ago at Chernobyl has reached its final resting place, completing an unprecedented engineering feat.Known as the New Safe Confinement (NSC), the shield will seal off an aging shelter -- built hastily after the disaster occurred in 1986 in what is now northern Ukraine -- that is leaking radioactive material. A first for modern engineering, the Chernobyl shield is the largest moveable, land-based structure ever built, according the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which manages funding for the international project.  The arch-shaped steel structure was assembled nearby and moved more than 1,000 feet into position with the help of a special skidding system of hydraulic jacks that pushed the mammoth shield one stroke at a time. \"Many people had doubts and didn't believe... However, I congratulate you, dear friends. Yes, we did it,\" said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during a ceremony at Chernobyl commemorating the event.A devastating blast The Chernobyl disaster, in what was then the Soviet Union, remains the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. A series of errors and technical malfunctions led to the meltdown of the No. 4 Reactor, which exploded on April 26, 1986, releasing radioactive plumes into the air. The blast at Chernobyl was nearly 400 times more potent than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Nearly 5 million people were exposed to whole-body radiation from the accident, and countless numbers have since died from radiation symptoms, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization. More than 100,000 residents were evacuated from the affected area and a 19-mile exclusion zone is still in place. Birth defects and cancer rates among residents in the area exposed to radiation are still high. 'One-of-a-kind technological challenge'Construction of the NSC is expected to be finished in late 2017 when the shield is fully sealed. The project costs some $1.7 billion and has been funded by contributions from more than 40 countries and organizations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund -- the largest international collaboration on nuclear safety to date, according to EBRD. A consortium of two French construction firms, called Novarka, started building the shield in 2010. Its project director, Nicolas Caille, said the NSC will ensure \"optimal safety conditions\" for the Ukrainian people over the next century, calling the endeavor a \"one-of-a-kind technological challenge.\" Rising 360 feet into the air with a span of 850 feet and length of 540 feet, the shield is tall enough to cover the Statue of Liberty and longer than two Boeing 777 jets placed end to end. It weighs over 36,000 tons, including the equipment inside, and has a lifespan of over 100 years, according to EBRD. The structure has a sophisticated ventilation system that eliminates the risk of corrosion. \"This is our contribution to the future, in line with our responsibility for those who will come after us,\" said Igor Gramotkin, Director-General of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The equipment inside the shield will be connected electronically to a control room outside, allowing all operations inside the dome to be managed remotely. The goal is to eventually safely dismantle the damaged structure underneath.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/europe/chernobyl-giant-shield/index.html"}

{"_id":"Gingrich mocks Romney for 'sucking up' to Trump","articleText":" (CNN)Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich mocked Mitt Romney on Wednesday for \"sucking up\" to President-elect Donald Trump as he contends for the position of secretary of state in the new administration. \"You have never, ever, in your career seen a serious adult who is wealthy, independent, been a presidential candidate, suck up at the rate that Mitt Romney is sucking up,\" said Gingrich -- an early Trump supporter and former 2012 GOP presidential rival of Romney's -- on Laura Ingraham's radio show Wednesday.Gingrich compared Romney's dinner with Trump on Tuesday to \"a scene in 'Pretty Women' where Richard Gere goes up to the salesman on Rodeo Drive and says, 'We need a little sucking up here.'\" \"I am confident that he thinks now that Donald Trump is one of his closest friends, that they have so many things in common, that they're both such wise, brilliant people. And I'm sure last night, at an elegant three-star restaurant in New York, that Mitt was fully at home, happy to share his vision of populism, which involved a little foie gras, a certain amount of, you know, superb cooking. But was done in a populist, happy manner,\" Gingrich said.Gingrich ridiculed Romney as an out-of-touch elitist, characterizing him as a bad fit for a team that defined itself in opposition to the type of GOP political establishment that the former Republican presidential nominee represents. \"Luckily for them, Mitt speaks French fluently. So he could help them with the menu, he could say, 'Oh, Mr. President-elect, this would be the perfect meal for you,'\" Gingrich said, mimicking a French accent. \"Something like maybe -- escargot, maybe -- triumphant pheasant under glass. Something really good, you can just imagine, god I'd love to have just been a fly on the wall, would have been so fun.\"The Trump loyalist said that he would respect whomever Trump ultimately chooses \"because it's his prerogative as president-elect,\" but he also suggested that Trump may cool on Romney after taking the temperature of his supporters during his \"thank you\" tour of rallies across swing states, kicking off today. Donald Trump's dramatic search for a secretary of state\"I think it will be very interesting if he goes on this thank you tour and his large crowds, you know, if he tests out the phrase Mitt Romney, secretary of state, it'll be very interesting to watch a Trump crowd respond, because it would not be pretty,\" he said.Gingrich instead plugged Rudy Giuliani, another early Trump supporter and close associate who is also in the running for the top diplomat post. \"I don't want to give up on Rudy. I think Rudy Giuliani is one of the great change agents of our lifetime. What he achieved was so unbelievable in New York City. That -- he would make a great secretary of state because he has the drive, energy and toughness to take on the State Department bureaucracy,\" he said. Gingrich was passed up by Trump when selected his running mate, tapping Indiana Gov. Mike Pence instead.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/politics/gingrich-romney-sucking-up-to-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Giuliani defends foreign business ties: 'Comparisons to Hillary Clinton are nuts'","articleText":" (CNN)Rudy Giuliani vigorously defended his business ties with foreign governments and the work his law firm did for foreign clients and countries in an interview with CNN's KFile Friday. The former New York City mayor is considered a top pick to be President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of state, but reports of his past consulting work for foreign governments, including in Qatar and Serbia, have raised conflict of interests concerns should he be chosen. In a phone interview with CNN, Giuliani cast his work, which included consulting work on reducing crime in Mexico City, El Salvador, Colombia, Chile, along with helping political candidates in Ukraine and the Dominican Republic, as a qualification to be secretary of state. The former New York City mayor also sought to rebut critics who say that his consulting and speeches make his attacks on the Clinton Foundation during the presidential campaign hypocritical.\"What I did violated no laws, no regulations,\" Giuliani said. \"It was a perfectly legal, lawful, thing to do. And also these comparisons to Hillary Clinton are nuts because I was in private business. I was not—there's no conflict with anything. I'm not a government official. I'm in private business. And finally, I wasn't selling influence. I was selling my expertise. And the services of my company. Giuliani contacted CNN in response to a story by CNN's KFile about his 2012 work consulting with Serbian politicians once tied to convicted war criminal Slobodan Milošević. Giuliani said he was providing development advice to the city of Belgrade. In interviews at the time, Giuliani said he was there \"to give advice\" to Aleksandar Vucic, now the Serbian prime minister, who was running for mayor at the time. Giuliani said that he was paid by a London company involved in putting together a plan for economic development in Belgrade. Press reports at the time cited Vucic saying he had invited Giuliani to advise him. In the interview Friday, Giuliani said that he was invited by the London company and that his team had assessed the offer and determined that they could provide useful advice to the city. He also defended the content of his consultation. \"I didn't go in there and give a public relations address,\" he said. \"I went there and gave a highly substantive speech on what happens to be one of the areas of knowledge which is perfectly lawful. I don't know what it is that I did wrong. Or how you can paint it is as wrong.\"\"I conducted myself in a very honorable way. Including a somewhat courageous way, to add, yeah, 'I think you should've been bombed,'\" Giuliani also said, referring to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. \"How many people go to a city and say, 'I think it was okay you were bombed. You know how often I've done that?\"Giuliani further cited his relationship with Viktor Yushchenko, the former Ukrainian president and foe of Vladimir Putin who was poisoned in 2004. He said that when he went to Ukraine, he was told that he couldn't meet with Yushchenko (Giuliani misspoke and said he couldn't meet with Viktor Yanukovych, another former Ukrainian president and a Putin ally, but described him in the interview as \"the Viktor that Putin poisoned or allegedly poisoned\"). The former mayor said that he met with Yushchenko anyway.  \"I said, 'F*ck you, I'll meet with him,'\" he said. \"And I did. And they took away my security and almost didn't let me out the country. And that's before the poor man was poisoned. He and his wife have become good friends of mine. And what I am upset about is the attacks on my reputation.\"In the conversation, Giuliani often returned to the idea that his work gave him foreign policy knowledge that would be valuable if Trump picks him as secretary of state, arguing that he is being unfairly \"hit on both ends,\" referring to critics who say he lacks experience and those who say he may be hampered by conflicts of interest. \"I know all these governments,\" Giuliani said. \"I know the good parts and the bad parts. When I go, I often meet with the prime minister, if I don't meet with the prime minister I always meet with the interior minister and almost always with the defense minister. They want my advice, because I have substantive expertise. They don't want my influence, nor did they try to ask me to influence President Obama which would be ridiculous of course or even President Bush. I'm not seen that way. I'm not seen as a lobbyist, government influencer. I am seen around the world as an expert on crime reduction, city development, and in a different part of my life an expert on securities law. I don't mean securities securities, I mean financial securities law.\"Giuliani went on to describe coverage of his consulting work as \"totally, totally and completely unfair and without any description of what I actually do.\" \"They make try to make it sound like I'm a world traveling lobbyist and what I am is a world traveling expert of crime reduction, terrorism, economic development and various aspects of international law and American law that is now becoming international law,\" he said.Giuliani defended his work for Middle Eastern countries like Qatar, which he said was a staunch ally of the United States at the time and claimed that he never worked for Saudi Arabia, which his former law firm Bracewell and Giuliani represented in Texas court cases. Giuliani left that firm in January. \"I let the State Department know that I was doing it,\" he said of his work for Qatar. \"They were supportive of it. I got paid for services. I did that in the best interests of my country. It was a different Qatar then, that was completely allied with the United States in the war against Iraq.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/kfile-giuliani-interview/index.html"}
{"_id":"Giuliani discussed foreign business ties in 2012 Serbian TV interview ","articleText":" (CNN)Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in a 2012 appearance on Serbian television, discussed his then-ongoing consulting work for Serbian politicians as well as work he did in other foreign nations. Giuliani, who is a top contender to be nominated by President-elect Donald Trump as secretary of state, has faced scrutiny in recent days for his foreign consulting work and legal representation of foreign governments. Those connections have raised conflict-of-interest concerns that could complicate his ability to serve as the nation's top diplomat. The former mayor appeared on 'Evening With Ivan Ivanovic,' a late night Serbian talk show, in April 2012, during a visit to the European nation to consult with Serbian politician Aleksandar Vucic, who at the time was running for mayor of Belgrade.  Vucic, now the prime minister of Serbia, is a former hardline nationalist who was once aligned with autocrat and convicted war criminal Slobodan Milošević. As minister of information in the late 1990s, Vucic instituted fines for journalists who criticized the government and banned some media. Vucic later moderated and expressed regret for his past actions. During his trip, Giuliani also met with Tomislav Nikoli, who was running for president of the country that year. Both Vucic and Nikoli are members of the Serbian Progressive Party.\"We're here to give advice to Mr. Vucic, who is running for mayor, about economic development and about how to organize a program to redevelop Belgrade, make it into a great world city,\" said Giuliani, adding he wanted to help the city lower unemployment and debt.  \"Those are things I'm an expert on, it's what I did in New York City, and I've advised other cities throughout the world about how to straighten up those problems.\"\"We've worked in Mexico City, we've worked in Puerto Rico, we've worked in Colombia. We've worked in some American cities, and we've done a good deal of security work in the Middle East,\" he said.Giuliani added that his company was being paid for the consulting.\"We're not involved in the election, we're not making an endorsement in the election. I don't know enough about the election to do that. We're just here to advise him, give our advice. My company gets paid for it, I don't get paid for it. That's what my company does, gets paid for giving advice, but that's being done by a private company not by the campaign.\"A spokesperson for Giuliani did not return an email and a phone call from CNN.The former mayor defended his foreign business ties in an interview with The New York Times this week. \"I have friends all over the world. This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world,\" he said. Giuliani's visit caused controversy at the time. The US embassy in the country issued a statement declaring  that the former mayor's visit wasn't an endorsement of a candidate by the US government. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton privately criticized Giuliani at the time.\"This is outrageous,\" Clinton wrote in an email when she was forwarded an Associated Press article on Giuliani's visit by her aide Cheryl Mills.Vucic lost the mayoral race, Nikolic won the presidency that year.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/kfile-giuliani-serbia/index.html"}
{"_id":"Giving up two years of your life for the 2016 campaign","articleText":"During the 1972 election, Timothy Crouse penned \"The Boys on the Bus\" -- a book that introduced us to the gritty (mostly male) journalists on the campaign trail. Over four decades later, the daily grind of election may be the same, but the faces have certainly changed.  Meet CNN's \"Girls on the Bus.\" (CNN)After months on the road last year, I finally had a day off and went to see my family in Dallas. But duty (and breaking news) called, and within minutes of arriving to play with my then four-year-old niece, I was back in the rental car, headed to the airport.\"Ashley goes on a lot of airplanes,\" my niece said, turning to her mother. \"I want her to stop doing that.\"Life isn't always glamorous working presidential campaigns, but those who do it — from the journalists who cover them to the staffers who execute them — all share one thing in common: They want to have a role in this unique American process.The primariesOn January 24, 2015, about 10 potential Republican candidates descended upon Iowa for the first major cattle call of the presidential race. Scott Walker was all the rage. Ted Cruz performed mightily. Donald Trump barely got any mention.It was a different time.It's also when my own campaign story began. Since then, I've covered events in 43 states, taking more than 400 flights and spending 524 nights in hotels. CNN assigned me to cover the (very large) Republican field, a beat that sent me racing across Iowa and New Hampshire for a primary that would last over a year.As an embed, you're responsible for shooting events, writing up stories, reporting on the campaigns, staking out candidates and occasionally producing for correspondents.And when there were 17 primary candidates, there was ample room for news. But it was the colorful and unexpected moments that truly stick out.Those memories include getting brushed by a few shell casings as Rand Paul hit up a shooting range before the first primary debate. I also shot video of John Kasich as he shot hoops with the Milwaukee Bucks, and I walked through a parade with Rick Perry (actually we jogged through a lot of it -- the man has a ton of energy).I watched Ted Cruz sign a woman's pair of pink cowboy boots. I followed Jeb Bush around the Iowa state fair for four hours on a hot August day. I tagged along as Chris Christie worked the line outside of Ben and Jerry's on free cone day. And I climbed aboard Trump's plane to ask him questions in a last-minute gaggle.Becoming a stalkerThe field started to narrow, and my focus became covering Bush full time under the assumption that he would be the front-runner. That storyline didn't last long, and the new story became how Trump was outgunning a former two-term governor who had an unprecedented amount of money behind him.It was interesting to watch and chronicle Bush's campaign from beginning to end, but more than that, it was fascinating to get to know the man and watch him evolve as a candidate. When your life becomes your candidate's life, you absorb everything they say and anything that impacts them.Studying a person like that — picking up on any inflection changes in their stump speech, reading thousands of their publicly-released emails, becoming obsessed over minor tweaks like switching from glasses to contacts — makes you feel like a stalker, yes, but it also helps you understand this person who wants to be the leader of the free world.Bush tried earnestly to be a more open candidate than Mitt Romney in 2012. He gave us access that our fellow embeds on other campaigns envied, he handed out his email address to voters, and he spent hours upon hours in conversations with people after events — all of which we were allowed to shoot.But he wasn't selling what Trump was selling to the public, and three weeks after Bush dropped out, I was reassigned to the man who would become the eventual nominee and now President-elect.Changing beatsGoing from Bush world to Trump world was a culture shock.Bush usually averaged 150-200 people at his intimate, town-hall style events. Trump held massive rallies at arenas with thousands of people. My first Trump rally was interrupted by close to a dozen protesters, and Trump dramatically read the lyrics to a song called \"The Snake,\" making a comparison between Syrian refugees and a poisonous snake.CNN producer Noah Gray had been covering Trump since the previous summer and he helped me navigate this bigger — and much louder — universe. We worked as co-embeds over the next eight months, covering the always-eventful rallies and trying to share with our network the frustration and anger felt by the voters who attended them.Often that anger was directed at us, the media. Most voters were pleasant one-on-one, and I learned about entirely new perspectives in those conversations. But when Trump would egg on his audiences to boo the press pen, sometimes the same lovely people I spoke to before the rally were suddenly flipping us off or screaming ugly things.Experiencing such vitriol was uncomfortable, but you learned to get used to that feeling and stay focused on the task at hand.The final pushAs it became clear that Trump would become the nominee and as the election turned from a primary to the general, our daily lives as embeds also changed. Gone were the hours-long road trips from event to event. Gone were TSA lines and protracted airport waits. Gone was spending an entire day in one state.Instead we traveled together as a press corps, chasing Trump's plane to multiple cities and states a day in our own chartered plane. We hustled to and from events, sometimes running with our gear to keep up with Trump's busy schedule. Our moments of peace came when we could cram in a nap on the plane or when Secret Service would let us pet their dogs.In the last week of the campaign, we did 30 flights -- landing in 11 states for 14 rallies in the final three days alone. It was an aggressive schedule that likely played a big part in his surprise victory on November 8. As a result, my body hurt that morning after Election Day; I could barely move. And thinking about the past 22 months lately has overwhelmed me.But I got to experience this country in a way that only a few get the chance to do, and I will never forget the people I met and the perspectives that shaped this election. It's been a whirlwind ride, one where I've learned to always adapt, never make assumptions, and never take things for granted -- like being able to put clothes in drawers and buy regular-sized shampoo bottles.I'm looking forward to moving back into an apartment in the coming weeks and actually staying in the same city for more than eight days in a row for the first time in two years -- all the while thankful that CNN entrusted me with this crazy job.And my now six-year-old niece, Emma, will get Auntie Ashley all to herself for two weeks next month.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/girls-on-the-bus-embed-life-campaign-trail-ashley-killough/index.html"}
{"_id":"Going to church could help you live longer, study says","articleText":" (CNN)Many Americans say they attend church because it helps them stay grounded and gives them spiritual guidance. A new study suggests that regular attendance may also help increase their lifespan.Researchers looked at data on nearly 75,000 middle-age female nurses in the United States as part of the Nurses' Health Study. The participants answered questions about whether they attended religious services regularly every four years between 1992 and 2012, and about other aspects of their lives over the years.The researchers found that women who went to church more than once a week had a 33% lower risk of dying during the study period compared with those who said they never went. Less-frequent attendance was also associated with a lower risk of death, as women who attended once a week or less than weekly had 26% and 13% lower risk of death, respectively.Women who regularly attended religious services also had higher rates of social support and optimism, had lower rates of depression and were less likely to smoke. However, the researchers took into account these differences between churchgoers and non-churchgoers when they calculated the decrease in death rates of 13% to 33%. Going to church could have a number of additional benefits that could, in turn, improve longevity, but the researchers were not able to examine them with the available data. Attendance could promote self-discipline and a sense of meaning and purpose in life, or it could provide an experience of the transcendent, said Tyler J. VanderWeele, professor of epidemiology in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. VanderWeele led the new research, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\"Our study suggests that for health, the benefits outweigh the potentially negative effects,\" such as guilt, anxiety or intolerance, VanderWeele said.Most of the women in the study were Protestant or Catholic, so it is not clear whether a similar association would be found between religious service attendance and longevity for people of other Christian religions, Judaism or Islam. The study also did not explore the association in men. Previous research suggests that male churchgoers also benefit, though their decrease in death rate is not as large as among women, VanderWeele said.\"There have been literally thousands of studies\" looking at whether religion is good for your health, said Dr. Dan German Blazer II, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center. The findings have been mixed about whether aspects of religious devotion such as prayer and spirituality -- such as reading the Bible or other religious literature -- improve longevity.\"The one (aspect) that is significantly more predictive of good health is about religious service attendance,\" said Blazer, who wrote an editorial about the new study in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine. Most people report that they are spiritual, and it is possible that actually attending religious services is good for their health because they are taking actions that are in line with their beliefs, Blazer said. \"You have a more integrated life in this sense.\" However, this explanation is purely speculative, and studies have not explored this theory, he added. The suggestion that attending religious services regularly could boost longevity has met with some criticism in the field. Other researchers have pointed out that the relationship could be due to other factors, such as the possibility that healthier people are more likely to go to church, perhaps because they are more mobile. The main strength of the current study is that the researchers were able to look at whether participants reported attending religious services at several points over many years, making it easier to find out which came first, religious activity or disease and health outcomes, Blazer said. Nevertheless, Blazer warns that it is important not to make too much of the new findings. \"This study does not suggest that clinicians prescribe attending religious services as a way to be more healthy,\" he said. It was not meant to assess going to church as an actual medical intervention.On the other hand, the study does suggest that \"clinicians who know their patients well and follow them over a period of time, like primary care doctors, inquire when it is appropriate about their religious beliefs and practices,\" Blazer said. That way, if patients say that attending religious services is important to them, the doctor can help ensure that they maintain a good relationship with their church, temple or mosque. This attitude about the place of religion in medical care is becoming more common among health care professionals and has been introduced into the curriculum of more and more medical schools, Blazer said.

{"_id":"Going to space is a real pain in the back","articleText":" (CNN)A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study. Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission. Things don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc. \"It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,\" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. \"So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.\"Like being in a body castMuch attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling. What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury. In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months. MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. \"Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,\" Chang explained.Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.Yoga in space?Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine. In addition to the \"fetal tuck\" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done. \"A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.\" Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station. Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity. Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.\"When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,\" he said. \"Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet.

The author works at the Institute. Boston (CNN)Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr hears the same refrain all the time from fans who think his sole focus should be basketball: \"Stick to sports.\" But that has never been the approach of the well-traveled Kerr, who was born in Beirut, lived in Egypt, and hasn't shied away from political commentary, especially not in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory earlier this month. \"People ask us, so why shouldn't I answer? I have this forum. If there's something important to speak on, then I think we should speak on it,\" Kerr told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files\" podcast, produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \"In this case, I felt it was important to address not the politics of the election, but the nature of the election cycle. It's the first time in my life that the election was not about policy, or even personality. It was about anger. It was about fear. And I was disgusted.\" \"I don't care what side of the political spectrum you're on,\" Kerr said. \"People vote for all kinds of reasons, right? You vote for your pocket book. You vote for abortion rights or gay marriage or you vote for certain social policies or maybe foreign policy. Maybe you're worried about this or that. And that's what it should be about. You should vote based on policy. But this election had nothing to do with policy. It had to do with hatred and fear and we had a candidate who stirred that up, and I thought it was a horrible precedent for our country.\" The day after Trump's victory, Kerr went on a self-described \"rant\" about the \"lack of respect\" in this year's presidential campaign, comparing it to \"The Jerry Springer Show.\" It was hardly Kerr's first foray into the world of politics: earlier this fall he praised Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and spoke out against police injustice. Kerr, whose father Malcolm was assassinated in 1984 shortly after moving to Lebanon as president of the American University of Beirut, credited his upbringing abroad for igniting his interest in politics. He noted that comments from Trump and his advisers about Islam have caused concern among Kerr's Muslim friends. \"If the president of the country can make remarks that are hateful and offensive, then it sort of rubber stamps it for a lot of people and that's scary,\" he said. \"I'm not the authority on any of this, but what I do feel strongly about is a level of respect that has to exist between candidates but also between people,\" he added. \"I'm a Democrat. I've got lots of friends who are Republicans. We have really great, healthy conversations. There's a respect level. That's how it should be. Again, people voting on policy? Absolutely. But the nature, the tenor of this election was ugly and nasty and it's scary in terms of what direction that is going to take.\" To hear the whole conversation with Kerr, which also touched on the impact of his father's death, his time playing alongside Michael Jordan for the Chicago Bulls, and his future in coaching, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

{"_id":"Goodwin says Trump won, in part, because of his story","articleText":"The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works for the podcast.CONCORD, Massachusetts (CNN)Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, has spent a career analyzing some of America's most consequential presidents, understanding their shortcomings and the characteristics that made them extraordinary.So, when Donald Trump, in his first debate against Hillary Clinton, boasted that, as someone who regularly wins, he has \"a winning temperament,\" the sentiment immediately captured Goodwin's attention.In her read of history, it is personal adversity rather than perpetual success that molds presidential temperament.\"I think overcoming adversity is an extraordinarily important trait for a leader,\" Goodwin told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files\" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.\"Which was what stunned me, in a way, when Donald Trump said that he had the very, very best temperament of anybody who had ever run for the president because he always won, that he had a winning temperament,\" Goodwin continued. \"History would record just the opposite.\"Goodwin went on to describe the positive transformations some of our presidents underwent after being struck by tragedy -- FDR's polio made him feel more connected to people; Lincoln's bouts of depression made him more empathetic; Teddy Roosevelt's personal losses gave him needed perspective.Listen to the full episodeGoodwin also discussed why it's important that our political leaders tell a story that captures the imagination of the people they aspire to lead. Goodwin, an evocative storyteller in her own right, said this was one of the crucial reasons for Trump's success.\"In a certain sense, because [Hillary Clinton] was telling a more complicated story about America and all the various things she wanted us to do, it didn't have the simplicity of a story that Donald Trump's did,\" Goodwin argued.\"Donald Trump told a story, whether true or not, that people felt was real,\" she continued, pointing to Trump's message of restoring America and bringing economic relief to those who felt forgotten by Washington.\"And that kind of story somehow reached out to a certain part of America. And even if Hillary's plans and her programs might have touched those people more deeply, the connection emotionally between her and those people seemed to have been lost,\" Goodwin concluded.The challenge for a president to lead by telling a sustained and engaging story is even more complicated now, Goodwin said, given the modern media landscape that must be navigated.\"It's much harder for a president now,\" said Goodwin, who wrote a book that focused in part on Teddy Roosevelt's belief in the president's ability, through his \"bully pulpit,\" to mobilize public opinion. Social media and other tools of communication mean that everyone has a platform now.\"The Internet has allowed people with megaphones as large sometimes as the big public figures,\" Goodwin said. \"You're competing against a lot of other people with a lot of other little or big platforms, so it's much harder, I think, to exercise public leadership in this media world than it was back in [Teddy] Roosevelt's time.\"To hear the whole conversation with Goodwin, which also covered her love of baseball, which historical moment she believes most closely parallels our politics today, her insights into some of our most seminal presidents, and much more, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

Brown was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.Siaufung \"Bosco\" Tjan, 50, was killed Friday inside his university office in the Seeley G. Mudd Building, police said. Brown was a student in Tjan's introductory lab course, CNN affiliate KTLA-TV reported.

{"_id":"Graham knocks Paul: 'He is my friend, he's a libertarian, but he's an outlier'","articleText":" (CNN)Sen. Lindsey Graham gave his full support to both Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton as picks for secretary of state by the incoming Trump administration, while chiding critics like Sen. Rand Paul who have vowed to oppose the potential nominees.\"You can put the Republicans in a very small car who are going to follow Rand Paul's advice when it comes to national security,\" Graham told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on \"At This Hour.\" \"He is my friend, he's a libertarian, but he's an outlier.\"Graham expressed confidence that both Giuliani and Bolton could be confirmed as heads of the State Department despite early opposition from Paul and Democrats, who have seized on Giuliani's international consulting work and paid speaking engagements -- something Hillary Clinton was criticized for -- as potential conflicts of interest. He also dismissed Paul's complaint  about the hawkish Bolton since his recess appointment during the Bush administration. Graham also said he could support another potential candidate -- his state's governor, Nikki Haley -- though his backing was more lukewarm.  \"I would say (Haley) did a good job as governor of South Carolina. She's talented, she's capable. I think she could do a good job in any assignment given. I don't know about her foreign policy. I haven't talked to her,\" he said, adding later, \"At the end of the day, I would support her.\"Other appointmentsGraham opined on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a potential pick for the Supreme Court vacancy, an idea --perhaps jokingly -- floated by Graham himself, despite a long history of criticizing the Texas firebrand. He had remarked earlier this week the largely unpopular Cruz would easily win a confirmation from his Senate colleagues, insinuating they might be eager to be rid of him.\"Ted Cruz is a constitutional conservative, very, very smart, in the mold of Scalia,\" Graham said, referencing Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away earlier this year.\"The people on (Trump's) list ... I could support them all. I just suggested that if you are looking for a Scalia-type figure, somebody to replace judge Scalia in their image judicially, Ted Cruz would fit that bill,\" he said. And Graham also said that he approved of Trump's apparent moves to install his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser, despite the controversy and charges of nepotism. Graham said it would be \"fine with me\" if Kushner worked as a senior adviser. \"It shows they got a good relationship. I don't know how many father-in-law's would pick their son-in-law's to do anything.\"Policy fightsWhile he enthusiastically supported some of Trump's potential administration appointees, Graham -- who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee -- expressed a firm willingness to challenge the new president on policy. As one of the more moderate Republicans in a closely divided senate, Graham could be positioned to wield significant influence in close votes. \"I can tell you if I disagree with the president,\" Graham said. \"I'm going to push back when I need to push back.\"  On the issue of Russian aggression, Graham sounded a more bellicose tone than Trump, who has urged friendlier relations. \"I have a different view of Russia. I don't think (Vladimir) Putin's our friend,\" he said. And Graham also stressed that counterterrorism efforts shouldn't be used as an excuse to permit Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad's atrocities. \"I see Assad as the butcher of Damascus ... I don't see Assad as an ally or friend of the United States,\" he said.Finally, Graham put some space between himself and Trump on immigration reform, saying he will \"vote for any bill that secures our border,\" but that \"I'm not going to vote for a bill that can't tell the difference between a grandmother who has been here illegally and a drug dealer. I just can't go there.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/lindsey-graham-rand-paul-donald-trump-confirmations/index.html"}

Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat who has represented Chicago in Congress for two decades, confirmed his grandson's death Saturday.\"His father had just told me about how proud of him,\" Davis said at a news conference, \"that he was because he was catching on and realizing that all of his life was in front of him.\"Police said two people forced their way into Wilson's residence before a physical altercation ensued and an unknown male offender began to fire shots.No suspects were immediately in custody Saturday morning, but Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, said a person of interest has been identified.Chicago Police spokesman Officer Jose Estrada, who earlier characterized the incident as a home invasion, said police believe it was \"not a random act\" and that \"somebody in the residence did know the offenders.\"Estrada could not confirm whether Wilson knew the suspect.A source with knowledge of the investigation said the incident began as an argument over a personal matter related to clothing and eventually led to the victim being shot.

{"_id":"Great escapes: The world's most beautiful contemporary cottages ","articleText":" (CNN)Award-winning architecture probably isn't the first thing that comes to mind when hearing the word \"cottage.\" More likely, it conjures images of quaint countryside dwellings -- rustic abodes in Cape Cod, thatched roofs in England, and modest oceanside retreats in Sweden.First emerging in medieval England between the 5th and 15th centuries, the word \"cottage\" refers to a home for cotters, peasants who worked on farms in the countryside. The more familiar style of rustic cottage architecture, typically made with heavy stones or wood, emerged in the 18th century. But quaint and cozy is no longer the order of the day. As more and more city dwellers look for a refuge to relax and recharge, cottages all over the world are getting sophisticated, environmentally sensitive makeovers.\"Contemporary taste calls for a lighter touch and a stronger connection between nature, the materials, and the architecture itself,\" says Charles-Bernard Gagnon, principal architect of Quebec City-based Cargo Architecture.The getaway planToronto firm Superkül is one of many firms answering the call for off-the-grid hideaways.\"Cottages are destinations of the heart, and those fortunate enough to own them really let their hair down in these rural properties,\" says co-principal architect Meg Graham. \"Immersion in nature and the larger landscape is critical (for people) to recharge and refresh, to see things in a new light.\"Tucked away on Georgian Bay in Ontario, Superkül's Shift Cottage is an idyllic getaway nestled between dense trees and unique rocks formations. The owners requested a home that would tread lightly on the land, so Graham and Andre D'Elia designed the 2,000-square-foot property on a natural clearing without destroying any vegetation.Graham says the cedar cladding exterior will eventually fade to a silvery gray that echoes the colors of the landscape.\"Architectural expression of cottages is freer, and there is a greater variety and diversity of form,\" says Graham. \"The focus has shifted outward, and people want to watch and feel like part of the change in seasons and skies.\"Related article: Secrets behind the world's great buildingsThe connection to nature continues inside Shift Cottage, where the duo chose pine and oak for the floors, as well as stacked stone for an inviting fireplace.\"It's a centering process of getting back to the basics, away from the intensity and trappings of urban life,\" says Graham.Location, location, locationFrom the materials used in construction to the orientation of windows, contemporary cottages take their cues from their specific location. And with large windows, concrete floors and raw finishes, Villa Boreale in Canada's boreal forest is about as close to nature as it gets.Deep in the woods, the vacation home is just a few hundred feet from a path where deer and black bears wander freely. \"Nature awakens all the senses,\" says Gagnon of Cargo Architecture. \"The great Canadian boreal forest in particular, in the Charlevoix region, offers a raw experience.\"To protect the surrounds, Gagnon made several sustainable choices, using locally sourced materials, cedar wood siding, recycled steel wall cladding and double insulation.The Danish-inspired design emphasizes the landscape surrounding the house, with a large window in the living room that frames the view. Meanwhile, residents might spot a moose while sipping an espresso in the morning, thanks to long vertical windows in the kitchen.Leave no footprintsWith a greater emphasis on enjoying and protecting nature, some owners are extra careful not to leave a trail of destruction. Forest Retreat, for example, barely even touches the ground. The 172-square-foot hideaway in Central Bohemia in Czech Republic rests on a giant boulder and two smaller stones, minimizing the impact on the land. \"We try to understand the surroundings and work with it. The site for Forest Retreat has its own unmistakable atmosphere,\" explains Petr Uhlík, principal architect of Uhlik Architekti. \"The retreat feels like a shy and quiet visitor amongst the boulders.\"Built for a busy urbanite who wanted to escape the daily grind, Forest Retreat is made of locally sourced wood from fallen trees on the owner's property. The far side of the residence is essentially one big window, making it feel as if guests are sleeping in nature.\"We chose the location and orientation of the retreat by watching the movements of the sun -- where the sun sets, where it rises,\" says Uhlík.\"That way, the view from the sleeping space frames the sunrise among the trees.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/01/architecture/most-beautiful-contemporary-cottages/index.html"}
{"_id":"Great sex linked to heart disease for older men but not women","articleText":" (CNN)If you're an older man in a relationship and you have sex once a week or more, you may be twice as likely to have a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event than a less sexually active man, according to a study released this week in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior. Especially if you enjoy it.\"Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable, or satisfying, had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,\" said study author Hui Liu, associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University.  The study analyzed survey data from 2,204 people enrolled in the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project in the United States. Men and women aged 57 to 85 in partnered relationships were asked about their sexual satisfaction, frequency and health status in 2005, then again five years later. Each person's cardiovascular health was also recorded by measuring their blood pressure, heart rate, elevated C-reactive protein and history of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes.While the analysis found great sex is risky for men in the survey, those who had sex one to three times a month and rated it less pleasurable had no increased risk for heart concerns. For their female partners, however, results were different. Women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.Mediocre sex better for heart health?\"These findings challenge the widely held assumption that sex brings uniform health benefits to everyone,\" Liu said. \"I think it is important for older people to understand the potential risks and benefits of sex.\"\"You have to interpret this data with grain of salt,\" said Dr. Kevin Campbell, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who specializes in heart rhythm disorders. \"It's in direct contrast with the significant clinical data we have showing that as men age if they continue to be sexually active their risk of cardiovascular disease actually decreases.\"I tell my patients a month after they have a heart attack or open heart surgery if they can walk a flight of steps without getting chest pain or shortness of breath,\" said Campbell, \"then they are fine to resume sexual activity.\"Surprising results for men\"The results for men were surprising,\" said Lui, agreeing they run counter to decades of research that shows a positive health effect from sexual behavior for men, including better prostate health. One reason for the unusual findings, she said, could be in the design of the study. She said while other research has tended to focus on younger age groups, this survey was on a nationally representative sample of older adults across the United States.\"It's a survey, not a gold-standard, randomized, clinically controlled trial,\" countered Campbell, also highlighting that the study was conducted in 2005, with a follow-up in 2010. \"Is it really relevant now that most everyone is on a statin and our treatment of cardiovascular disease has continued to improve?\" he asked.Another reason for her findings, Lui said, might lie in the use of erectile dysfunction supplements by many older men, or the level of stress created by the act of sex itself.\"Older men may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons,\" Lui said. \"Therefore, they may exert themselves to a greater degree of exhaustion and create relatively more stress on their cardiovascular system in order to achieve a climax, which may hurt health.\" That could possibly be true, Campbell said, if the man is suffering from an unknown cardiovascular blockage or if he is using certain medications for existing heart disease. \"If they are taking any type of nitroglycerin, it can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure with any of the erectile dysfunction drugs,\" Campbell said. \"That needs to be monitored very carefully.\"Sex and relationship educator Laura Berman agreed. \"It's about being careful and understanding the risk factors,\" said Berman, a clinical assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. \"If you're talking about the typical sexual scenario for most baby boomers, it's him on top, doing the work. It does make sense to me that it may be more risk factors for an older man than an older woman.\"She added, \"So men should be sure they are physically able to have sex, and then it's about being careful and understanding the risk factors.\"Lastly, said Lui, having a high frequency of sex may indicate problems of \"sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity or sexual impulsivity\" for men, and could be related to \"psychological states such as anxiety or depression, which may lead to negative cardiovascular health.\"\"To say that wanting frequent sex after a certain age may be bad for you is a problematic statement to make,\" said certified sex educator Logan Levkoff. \"Any time we make these sort of grandiose statements of sex and sexuality it's problematic. There is no one normal on how we experience intimacy.\"A win-win for womenWomen, however, have good news. \"Good sexual quality may protect older women from cardiovascular risk in later life,\" Lui said. That makes sense, said Berman, because of the way that women view their sexual relationships. \"It's not so much the number of orgasms or how vigorous the sexual experience that predicts a woman's sexual satisfaction,\" Berman said. \"It's how close she feels to the person she is having sex with, through kissing and cuddling as well as orgasms. That is the key to her emotional and physical well-being, which benefits her health and her heart, and everything else.\"Men, however, are different. \"The way men feel emotionally close to their partner is through the physical act of sex,\" Berman said. \"They benefit from an emotional connection, but in their minds, they don't need it as much and don't get as stressed, anxious, depressed as a woman will. They will feel that way if they are not getting sex, but they won't see isolation as such a loss.\"She added, \"If a man is in a relationship, no matter what sort, he will live longer, but if a woman is in a bad relationship she will live less long.\"The takeaway for older couplesSo what's an older couple to do when it comes to sex and the risk of heart disease?\"We need to weigh the cost-benefit analysis and allow the older sexual relationship to progress, because we're living longer in our society and we have to deal with this,\" Berman advised. \"I still believe that for the majority of older adults, the physical and emotion benefits outweigh the risk factors.\"Campbell, the cardiologist, said, \"Here's the bottom line. Patients need to talk about sex with their doctors, regularly, and on each office visit, so we can diagnose and address any concerns before they escalate.\" Levkoff agreed.\"All of this gets back to our inability or ability to communicate about sex and pleasure and health,\" she said. \"It's not surprising that an older population might have some discomfort about speaking up, but the conversation of sex and aging is one that we should have been having for years.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/great-sex-older-men-women-study/index.html"}
{"_id":"Green Party files for Wisconsin recount, audit","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Green Party officials filed Friday for a recount in Wisconsin, following reports of voting discrepancies, and were seeking a deeper investigation into the election results, which handed the state to Donald Trump two weeks ago. Wisconsin Green Party co-chairman George Martin said that they were seeking a \"reconciliation of paper records\" -- a request that would go one step further than a simple recount, spurring, he said, an investigation into the integrity of the state's voting system.\"This is a process, a first step to examine whether our electoral democracy is working,\" Martin said. The announcement came as Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Thanksgiving fundraising blitz passed $5 million. The money is well beyond the $2 million mark the Green Party initially set, and Wisconsin party officials said that any additional money not used for the recount would be used to train Green Party candidates for local office. The goal as of Friday was to raise $7 million. \"We don't know, and we think the forensic computer experts have raised serious questions. What we do know is that this was a hack-riddled election, we saw hacks into voter databases, into party databases, into individual email accounts. We know that there were attempts made broadly on state voter databases and we know that we have an election system that relies a computer system that is wide open to hacks,\" Stein told CNN's John Berman Thursday. \"It's extremely vulnerable, Americans deserve to have confidence in our vote.\"Late Friday afternoon, the Wisconsin Elections Board said it had received the petition from Stein and the Green Party and \"is preparing to move forward with a statewide recount of votes.\"\"We have assembled an internal team to direct the recount, we have been in close consultation with our county clerk partners, and have arranged for legal representation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice,\" Wisconsin Elections Board Administrator Michael Haas said. \"We plan to hold a teleconference meeting for county clerks next week and anticipate the recount will begin late in the week after the Stein campaign has paid the recount fee, which we are still calculating.\" Hacking experts alerted the Clinton campaign earlier this week it was possible, based on voter low turnouts in some counties with electronic voting, that voting systems might have been hacked. But nobody has presented any evidence yet that they were tampered with.Even if Stein and others succeed in winning recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, it's unclear they would be enough to swing the election from Trump to Hillary Clinton, with Trump holding leads as big as more than 60,000 votes in Pennsylvania. When Florida officials launched their recount in 2000, the margin was just 537 votes. The Clinton campaign has stayed out of the recount debate, which sprouted up over the Thanksgiving holiday, even though it was a conference call that election hacking experts had with her campaign staff which led to the drive. The Trump campaign and his top advisers have dismissed the effort. Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted on Thanksgiving that their opponents were being sore losers.\"Look who 'can't accept the election results' Hillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States,\" Conway wrote.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/politics/green-party-recount-wisconsin/index.html"}

By 2050, around 66% of the global population likely will live in urban areas. In Africa alone, there will be nearly 800 million more people living in cities than today.  To provide for all these new urban dwellers, we need more buildings, more bridges, more public transport and more energy -- and all of that requires money. City governments often struggle to raise the funds they need for urban mobility projects such as rail or bus rapid transit. There is a significant gap between the supply and demand for urban infrastructure -- some estimates suggest it is upward of $1 trillion per year to 2030.Despite the challenges, the economic and environmental arguments for increasing investments in cities are clear. Investing in more compact, connected, efficient cities with modern public transport systems can spur economic growth while also having positive effects for the well-being of residents and for the climate.  Investing in sustainable infrastructureResearch from the New Climate Economy has found that investing in sustainable urban infrastructure such as public transport, building efficiency and waste management could generate energy savings with a current value of $16.6 trillion by 2050. Meanwhile, sustainable cities have cleaner air, less traffic congestion and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.Devising ways to scale financing for urban infrastructure, and to shift capital flows to make sure new projects are sustainable, is the next great challenge facing cities. To meet it, cities must have the authority and resources they need to make bold investments. Mayors and local policymakers are eager to take on the challenge, but they must have the authority and resources to do so.  The first step is to improve cities' access to private finance by improving their creditworthiness. Right now, only 4% of the 500 largest cities in developing countries are considered creditworthy, hampering their ability to raise capital. Turning to the private sector for investment Estimates suggest that with the right policies, private sector investment could fill up to half of the infrastructure-financing gap.For example, Kampala, Uganda, recently set out a plan to improve its governance and financial management, and has gained a reputation as an effective, reform-minded and innovative authority. This improved the city's creditworthiness to an \"A\" rating at the national scale for long-term debt instruments.  The improved rating almost doubled its borrowing allowance for large-scale sustainable urban infrastructure. Municipal green bonds are another way to attract capital. The municipal green bond market is relatively small, valued at about $6 billion in 2015, but fast growing.Last year, in the biggest issuance yet, Seattle's Sound Transit sold nearly $1 billion of green bonds that will help fund voter-approved regional transit projects, including construction of more than 30 miles of light rail extensions. Johannesburg recently issued a green municipal bond with a target value of $136 million. The bond was oversubscribed. Another South African city, Cape Town, is looking to use its \"AAA\" credit rating and pipeline of climate action projects to issue a green bond that it intends to have certified through the Climate Bonds Initiative.These measures, coupled with increasing pressure on the market to invest in instruments that support and deliver sustainable objectives, mean that Cape Town is hopeful that this bond will attract a favorable investor response when it goes to market.Public-private partnerships can also be an effective way for cities to improve access to private finance for urban infrastructure.Bangkok's Skytrain and Bogota's Bus Rapid Transit were both financed in part through such partnerships. Cities, especially in the developing world, can also tap into multilateral development banks and international climate funds.For example, the Global Environment Facility has a new $140 million program in 22 pilot cities expected to leverage $1.4 billion for smart urban development. New heart of economic developmentCity-level action works best when supported by national policies that place urban infrastructure at the heart of economic development. A new global initiative -- the Coalition for Urban Transitions, with experts from more than 20 of the world's leading urban-focused institutions -- will help support national governments to develop these strategies. But even if national action stalls, as some worry may happen after the US election, city-level action will continue to blaze forward. As part of the new Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, more than 7,000 cities and urban areas have committed to developing energy and climate action plans, a good starting point for identifying city infrastructure needs.In addition, city networks such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, and United Cities and Local Governments can share best practices, spread new technologies, facilitate new forms of finance and support project preparation.As both a co-chair and member of the Global Covenant's mayoral board, we will ensure investors see the data cities are reporting on significant actions they are taking as evidence for increasing funding. Building the sustainable cities of the future will be challenging, and we have a long way to go to close the urban financing gap. The good news is that cities are finding innovative solutions to do it, and we are already seeing results.

{"_id":"Group helps former foster kids establish a home all their own","articleText":"\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute\" airs live on CNN and CNNgo Sunday, December 11 at 8 p.m. ETLos Angeles (CNN)Georgie Smith was working as a designer and chef in Los Angeles when a young man named Barry sought her out.He was 23 years old and living on his own after growing up in the foster care system.\"I went to see him living in his apartment, amongst black garbage bags,\" Smith said. \"It was unacceptable. ... I immediately thought of my nephew, who was around the same age, and I did what I would do for him.\"Los Angeles County has the largest foster youth population in the country. At 18 to 21 years old, they age out of the system, often with no family, financial or community support. And the odds are stacked against them.Statistics show that many former foster youth will experience homelessness, poverty or incarceration along with higher rates of suicide, teen pregnancy and drug addiction. \"They're out on their own,\" said Smith, 47. \"They finally get to that amazing place of having their own space, and then they're sleeping on the floor.\"In 2014, Smith gathered a team of volunteers, collected donated furniture and household items and transformed Barry's makeshift living space into a real home. That experience led Smith to start A Sense of Home. The nonprofit has since created comfortable living spaces for 130 young people who have aged out of the system.\"These kids have such resilience and are so inspiring. They are so incredibly positive and hopeful,\" Smith said. \"I just feel it's incumbent on us -- the community -- to be their village.\"CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Smith about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: You sort of stumbled into helping foster youth before you met Barry. How did that happen?Smith: Several years ago, my partner, Melissa, and I were looking into adoption. We happened to ask about the children that are taken away from their families -- what about them? That's when I discovered the foster system. And I was frankly appalled and wanted to get involved. We were so moved by the plight of foster youth that we began to volunteer (with) organizations that care for (them). Barry found me through a design video posted on Facebook. It was miraculous how we transformed (his apartment). And this was such an easy, tangible way to make a difference. So I just kept doing it. It just snowballed. It seemed really clear to me that we as a community could share what we have too much of, give to these kids that have no family, no community and who are sleeping, eating and studying on the floor.CNN: How do you find the young people your group helps?Smith: We get referrals from agencies across L.A. County and surrounding counties. The youth must have a referral so we can establish that they truly were in the system.They also have to secure an apartment, enroll in college courses and/or be working 30 hours per week and have a GED or be studying for it. Obtaining the apartment is the most important factor. We meet them halfway. They have overcome so much to get to that place.Nearly all of them have experienced homelessness, and most, if not all, have experienced abuse. Eighty percent are young women; 30% have their own babies. Many are guardians to their own siblings.CNN: The spaces you and your team create look like something out of a magazine. How does it all come together?Smith: We have an all-foster-youth staff who collect the donations, store it at the warehouse, organize what items we're getting to them, load it onto the truck and then are there to coordinate the volunteers and help them get everything installed in the home.Every week we do a minimum of one home, outfitting their space with every conceivable item one needs to set up their first-ever home -- from soap to bedding and beds and curtains to fully stocking their kitchen with organic food. We provide them with tables and chairs and a desk on which to study. Art is really important. So we try and find pieces that really reflect the aspirations of the youth so that they can look up and feel really inspired by the art on their walls.CNN: The work has become about more than just setting up furniture and walking away.Smith: All the youth come and pay it forward. They've got a community of former foster youth and the volunteers.When we do a home celebration, a housewarming, (it's) a time for everyone to chill and hang out and break bread, to do spoken word, to tell their stories and share with the youth that are just receiving their home. It's just amazing. They get to hang out and be together and network and find job opportunities and get mentors. That foundation of home, which our family provides for us -- they don't have that. By setting up their first home, it gives them the foundation from which they can succeed.Want to get involved? Check out the A Sense of Home website and see how to help.

{"_id":"Gupta: DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana","articleText":" (CNN)There is really just one salient question when it comes to today's decision by the Drug Enforcement Administration to expand the number of growers of research-grade marijuana, while still not changing the scheduling of marijuana: Will this decision make it significantly easier for scientists to study the medical benefits of marijuana? The answer sadly is: unlikely. And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.Up until today, the University of Mississippi has been the only federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana in the United States. In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same. The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity. While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door. In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.That is the predicament of medical marijuana.Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research. Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive. There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place. Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press. This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.Then, after years of those bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock. Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself. Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.The problem, however, is that last word in NIDA's name: \"abuse.\" According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary \"Weed,\" the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine. Abrams makes an important point. Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years. That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits. The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as \"Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis,\" \"Cannabis induced pancreatitits\" and \"Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer.\" That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture of the harm-benefit ratio.Contradictory policyThe road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.This is one of many quotes from his 1988 petition (PDF) to unschedule marijuana. \"In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.\"Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself. And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives. Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts. The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/health/gupta-dea-marijuana/index.html"}

I loved it,\" she said.\"You know you've got the right sport for your kid when they don't complain about having to go -- they really want to go,\" said her mom, Barb Foster.By the time she was 11, Kate was practicing for 25 hours a week at the gym.But then she started feeling sick off and on for several months -- and the symptoms wouldn't go away.\"I just felt terrible all the time. I was tired, and I got a bunch of bruises. Then I started getting staph infections. That's when we were like, 'Something's wrong here,'\" Kate said. A blood test revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia. The doctor broke the news to her parents.\"We packed our bags and her bag. Kate was still at the gym,\" her mom said. \"We drove directly to the children's hospital. They had a room waiting for us.\"Kate started chemotherapy immediately, and it wiped out her immune system.\"One of the reasons why my hospital stays were so long was because of my complications. My first hospital stay, I got a gangrene infection,\" she said.\"All of a sudden, we went from cancer patient to she was on life support for three days,\" her mom said.During her second hospital stay, Kate got another infection in the same leg and ended up in the intensive care unit. By her third round of chemo, before her bone marrow transplant, doctors found an infection in her knee joint. \"That's when they finally said, 'We have to amputate,'\" Kate recalled. \"I was devastated. I actually told them no. They were not going to take off my leg. ... Then I came to my senses. I knew, and my family knew, that it was my leg or my life.\"At that point, said her dad, Lynn Foster, \"She started crying, and she said, 'What about gymnastics?'\"Then Kate's coach said something to her that really changed her mindset.\"She said, 'I've never taught a one-legged gymnast before, but I'm willing to try if you are,'\" Kate said.That motivated her to get back to the sport she loved.\"Kate is all driven from the inside,\" said her coach, Denise Cooper. \"I think that's what made her such a great fighter against leukemia.\"Kate went back to the gym for the first time on her 13th birthday.

{"_id":"Harassment in schools skyrockets after election, teachers report","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)In the days following Donald Trump's presidential victory, students in Kansas chanted, \"Trump won, you're going back to Mexico,\" to students from other countries, according to a high school teacher in a suburban community within the state.In Oregon, a high school teacher photographed vandalism in the boys' bathroom, which mentioned the KKK and used the n-word.In Tennessee, a black student was blocked from entering his classroom by two white students chanting, \"Trump, Trump,\" according to a high school teacher at the school where this happened.And, in Georgia, a 12-year-old white male student saw an \"X\" on another white student's paper and proceeded to draw a swastika on his paper, according to a middle school teacher at the school. \"And our administration is telling us not to talk about it,\" the teacher said. Those are just a few of the examples given by more than 10,000 educators, 90% of whom are teachers, who responded to an online survey sponsored by Teaching Tolerance, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is dedicated to reducing prejudice and improving relations among school children across the country. The organization has been critical of Donald Trump following comments from the candidate it characterized as fueling racism and bigotry. The educators were asked to answer a series of questions about the climate at their schools following the presidential election.In the first national snapshot of what teachers are observing, nine out of 10 educators who responded to the survey said the election has negatively impacted students' behavior and mood. Forty percent said they have heard derogatory language used against students of color, Muslims, immigrants and other students based on gender or sexual orientation.\"We are still daily experiencing the affects of the outcome,\" said Lindsey Polkl, a fifth-grade teacher in Minnesota. \"My students have begun playing a game called 'Trump's Coming,' in which one non-Hispanic student yells 'Trump's Coming' and all of the Hispanic students need to hide.\"  \"There have been more fights between students as well as students toward teachers, a direct result of the anxiety our students are constantly feeling,\" Polkl said. \"Daily we discuss and answer questions about the hate they see spewed across the internet and within their community, about what is true and what is not true.\"In all, there were more than 2,500 reports of \"negative incidents\" of bigotry and harassment that can be directly tied to the rhetoric of the presidential campaign, according to the report, entitled \"After Election Day: The Trump Effect.\" These incidents include posting graffiti such as swastikas and comments by students saying something along the lines of, \"Better pack your bags. You're going to be deported,\" said Maureen Costello, director of Teaching Tolerance.This new survey is not scientific and does not represent a random sampling of teachers across the country. It was disseminated to teachers, staff and other educators by Teaching Tolerance through a link on its website and across social media, and was also shared by other education groups. It stands to reason that teachers and educators who are witnessing problems were the ones more likely to respond. Still, the survey results do paint a picture of the anxiety that is being felt in some classrooms around the country.\"If I had to say, looking at the results, does it skew in some way, I would say that it skews toward people who teach some of the large numbers of immigrants, vulnerable students,\" said Costello. \"Those are the people we really heard from because I think those are the schools that are most affected and clearly people who didn't think there was any problem going on probably didn't feel as compelled to answer the survey.\"Hateful harrassment up, say advocatesNationwide, there have been more than 867 incidents of \"hateful harassment\" in the first days following the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center says. In a press conference Tuesday, Richard Cohen, the center's president, said he fears those incidents are under reported. \"These incidents of hate occurred in schools, on public streets and parks and in retail establishments. People were even targeted in their homes,\" said Cohen. \"These incidents have been ugly. And time after time the perpetrator has invoked Mr. Trump's name. The level of hate that has been unleashed is unprecedented.\"\"Our report also documented about 20 incidents against Trump supporters,\" added Cohen. \"And we would repudiate those acts as well.\"In the \"After Election Day\" report, a \"very small minority\" of teachers said the election has not affected their schools. Most of the teachers who felt that way came from schools that were predominantly white, with few students of color or immigrants.\"Truly it hasn't had an impact,\" wrote a middle school teacher in Utah. \"Because I talk about these things in class, I have been able to see what little impact there is. Colleagues haven't seen anything.\"But 80% of the educators who responded said they have observed a heightened anxiety on the part of some students, namely immigrants, Muslims, African Americans and LGBT students. In some cases, the anxiety lead to thoughts of suicide. \"In a 24-hour period, I completed two suicide assessments and two threat of violence assessments for middle school students,\" a Florida middle school counselor reported in the survey. \"This was one week after the election... students were threatening violence against African Americans. Students were suicidal and without hope. Fights, disrespect have increased as well.\"In Tuesday's press conference, Janet Murguía, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group with community ties throughout the country, said a call with their affiliates backed up the Teaching Tolerance survey. \"What were they seeing in those first days after the election?\" asked Murguía. \"They told us of countless incidents of harassment, verbal and physical taunts and most importantly, many students contemplating taking their own lives. Everything the teachers reported is collaborated by what we are hearing from our affiliates.\"Heightened anxiety for minority students\"The takeaway message is first of all that school administrators and school board members and anyone who has to do with education has a crisis on their hands,\" said Costello. \"If you're talking about at least a quarter of students -- and it's estimated that a quarter of students in American schools are immigrants, or the children of immigrants -- suffering trauma, that is going to have quite the impact over the course of the year.She added that \"there's certainly been a breakdown in school culture and I think many schools are now ripe for incidents.\" One of the teachers who responded to the survey, who didn't want to share her name publicly or the name of her school for fear of retaliation, told CNN that incidents of harassment and vandalism were left unpunished at her school.\"There was no investigation as it was determined it would be impossible to know who committed these acts,\" she said via email. \"Many incidences are unreported or under reported, as there is a fear of retaliation. This is an area of the country where most adults voted for, and avidly support, Trump.\"Another teacher who responded to the survey, a high school teacher in Kansas who reported that students were chanting to the English language learners that they would be sent back to Mexico, believes the total number of negative incidents across the country is probably much larger than has been publicly reported so far. She says teachers are not able to report incidents directly to the press meaning many of them are never revealed to the public.\"We're supposed to keep everything in house,\" said the teacher who also didn't want to use to use her name, saying school policy forbids her from independently talking to the press. \"That's pretty standard for most districts and most schools. If there's a problem, you take care of it internally but you don't go out to the press with it.\"Hostility caught 'a lot of people unaware'Schools were not prepared for what unfolded following Trump's unexpected defeat of Hillary Clinton, some teachers said.\"I don't think that they anticipated in any way what kids were going to say because for the most part, our schools are very diverse,\" said the teacher in Kansas. \"It's not something we deal with anymore. It's not like the '50s, so this reactionary stuff going on just caught a lot of people by surprise.\"While two-thirds of respondents to the survey said that administrations have been \"responsive\" to what's been going on at their school, four out of 10 said they didn't think their school had a real plan of action to deal with incidents of bias and hate.The Kansas high school teacher said her school, and others, could use better resources, including more training for teachers, administrators and staff.\"I think a lot of people thought we were in the post-racial era and they didn't expect this going backwards kind of behavior,\" she said. \"This kind of hostility just really caught a lot of people unaware.\"As for what caused the hostility, she believes it's what students saw on TV during the presidential campaign and what they're hearing at home. \"I think it's the dark underbelly of this country. It wasn't socially acceptable to be like this for a long time.\"Since the incidents in the days following the election, however, things at her school have really calmed down. \"A week and a half ago, it was like, 'Oh my God,' \" but since then, the school has gotten proactive, she said.\"Teachers are out in the hall, (the) administration's out in the hall, security's out in the hall,\" she said. \"Our kids know that if anything happens to anybody, we will act upon it. We will pull security footage if we have to but everybody here needs to be safe.\"Have you heard about any unique ways teachers are trying to bring students together following the election?

{"_id":"He's now a surgeon at the hospital that saved his life","articleText":" (CNN)On Kevin Morton's first night in the operating room, he wasn't wearing scrubs. His mind was reeling, his body shuddering and failing. It comes back to him in flashes. In July 2007, when he was 22, he was balancing college classes and working 48-hour weeks as the manager of a Detroit Arby's. Shifts at the restaurant often lasted until after midnight, and this particular night was no exception. Morton dismissed his co-workers, finished his closing duties and walked out to the quiet parking lot alone.\"My car was in reverse when I saw the shadow (of a man) coming up,\" Morton said. There was a flash of light and a loud noise; Morton knew that he had been shot in the stomach. The man robbed him and ran away. Morton's first thought was that the hospital, St. John, was too far of a drive. He knew there was a police station a few miles down the street, since officers would often stop by Arby's for lunch. Though his body was fading rapidly, Morton somehow steered his car to the road, set for the station. He didn't make it far. Morton passed out, but from what he was told, he swerved off the road and was found by a passer-by, who dialed 911. He briefly remembers being inside of an ambulance, an oxygen mask covering his face. The second time he woke, he was on an emergency room table, having his clothes ripped off by doctors. \"All I could think about was my younger sisters,\" said Morton, now 31. \"It's funny, but that's the only thought I had. I kept thinking, 'I have to stay alive for them.' \"         Beating the oddsDr. Dharti Sheth, a surgeon, was on call in the St. John trauma center the night Morton was shot. She heard the dispatch: a code 1 trauma patient shot in the abdomen, one of the most vulnerable areas of the body. Luckily, the bullet spared Morton's vital organs. \"He had no vital organ injuries,\" Sheth said. \"He was alert, amazingly. I had to convince him that he was going to be OK.\" Despite Sheth's reassurance to her patient, Morton had about a 10% chance of surviving for more than 24 hours, Sheth recalled. The gunshot had pierced his stomach, damaging his large and small intestines. Most critically, half of Morton's pancreas had been destroyed. Sheth moved quickly. She stabilized her patient, controlled the hole in his stomach and began closing the wounds with sutures. Meanwhile, Morton's family -- his father, stepmother and two younger sisters -- braced themselves for the worst. \"I think (Sheth) threw a couple of extra staples in there,\" Morton said. \"She went the extra mile to save my life, even when the vascular surgeon said (my case) was futile.\" He survived the night. But a long, difficult road still lay ahead. For the next six weeks, Morton was confined to the intensive care unit, his vitals closely monitored for signs of failure. His weight dropped from 160 pounds to 107. Injuries to his digestive system made eating impossible. Even after he was discharged from the hospital, he had to be fed through an IV for the next year. Morton had complications: A fistula developed in his small intestine, draining liquid onto his skin.\"If I were to drink a Pepsi, the Pepsi would gush out of my side,\" Morton said. With every drawback, he told himself, \"This will pass. This will pass.\" Recovering and rediscovering a passion for medicineMorton's experience was traumatic, but it made his life goals suddenly clear. \"This event happened to me, and it (relit) the fire and love for medicine,\" Morton said. Though some details of the shooting are blurry, Morton remembers the man he was at the time of the shooting. He was a student at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, studying biochemistry: a subject encouraged by his stepmother, who worked for a pharmaceutical company in the area. Before the shooting, Morton was on a pre-medical track, possibly pursuing a career in pharmacy, but that plan didn't seem feasible anymore. His grades were slipping. \"Life got hard,\" he said. \"I couldn't afford to study as much as the other kids,\" he said. At that point, he remembers, \"I just wanted to get a degree, get a job and make money.\" Long work hours were necessary to pay rent, but they came at the expense of valuable study time. With student loans looming, Morton was concerned with paying off his college debt, and he couldn't even consider paying medical school tuition.After the shooting, Morton's stepmother gave him a laptop to use in his hospital bed. He started researching his injuries, excited to recognize medical terms from his college science classes. Witnessing the effects of Sheth's precision in the operating room and compassion with her patients was an inspiration for Morton to pursue medicine again. \"Most surgeons only see patients during the operation, and maybe a follow-up appointment,\" Morton said. \"(Sheth) was very involved post-care. She kept my family in the loop and continued to check in even after I left the hospital. She was very motivating.\" \"Kevin says I inspired him to be a doctor,\" Sheth said. \"He had mentioned during recovery that he wanted to go into medicine, then he called to say he was going to medical school at Michigan State. I was so happy for him. \"He has all the qualities of a good doctor. He has the intellect, the personality, good eye contact, and is very pleasant and easy to talk to. He's very positive.\" When Morton graduated from Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine in May, Sheth came to the ceremony. She also attended her patient's wedding seven years ago. Along with Sheth as a doctor and mentor, the unfailing support from Morton's wife, Sherry, support from his family and a strong conviction in God helped pull the doctor through every challenge -- from recovering from a gunshot to managing medical school.Morton contributes his drive and optimism to his father, Kevin Sr.\"He knows how to make the best out of every situation,\" Morton said. \"Even in the hospital, when we didn't know what would happen.\" Because of Morton's strength of character, Sheth said, \"He had the courage to take a good path in life.\"Returning to the operating roomAfter Morton graduated from Michigan State, he moved back to his hometown of Warren, Michigan, with his wife and young daughter. This fall, he began his medical residency in surgery at the very place where his life took a dramatic turn: St. John hospital. \"It was weird walking down those corridors again,\" he said. \"They gave me an uneasy feeling.\" Morton doesn't have much time to dwell on bad memories, however. He rotates between St. John's three hospital branches, including the one in Detroit where he was treated in 2007. On a typical Tuesday morning, he wakes up at 4:15 a.m. and arrives at the hospital about 4:45 a.m. to see his patients and meet with the upper level attendants. Then from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., he's in the operating room, where the soundtrack might be a mixtape of Tupac and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. \"It's very busy, very fast-paced,\" Morton said. \"Our program is good at getting residents first-hand experience.\" Residency has its lows -- long days at the hospital coupled with hours of studying at night -- but it also has its highs, like being able to pay back the service he received in 2007. \"I try to block out the past, as a healing process,\" said Morton. \"But from going through that experience, I feel like I can connect more with my patients.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/health/kevin-morton-surgeon-st-john-hospital-detroit/index.html"}
{"_id":"Health care refugees: Family flees Florida to save daughter's life","articleText":"This is the first part of a series on health care refugees. Read the second part here.  (CNN)Kim and Richard Muszynski love Florida. They love the beaches and the fishing and the beautiful weather and the Sunday afternoon barbecues with their large extended family.Rich has lived in Florida all his life and Kim since she was 6 years old.But in September, the couple left the Sunshine State. They packed their bags, took their 5-year-old daughter, Abby, and moved away.They wept as they kissed their older daughters, Katlin, 22, and Christina, 16, goodbye, leaving Christina to finish the last half of high school without them. They wept again as they said goodbye to their parents and friends and Rich's job on a fishing boat and the only community they've ever known.The Muszynskis say they fled Florida because they think Abby's health insurance was killing her.Abby was born missing a piece of her brain and while in Florida had frequent, large seizures, sometimes several in one day, that shook her entire body. She gasped for air, and her parents gave her oxygen and prayed she'd keep breathing, but doctors warned them that any seizure at any time could mean the end of her life.Like nearly half of all children in Florida, Abby has Medicaid, the state-run health insurance. Her parents say that instead of being helpful, Florida Medicaid refused to pay for lifesaving medicines and took so long to pay some of her health care providers that at times, they refused to treat her.Advocates for children on Medicaid say that the Muszynskis' story doesn't surprise them and that they see families leaving a handful of other states too in search of better Medicaid programs.\"The state has done everything in its power to support this family,\" Mallory McManus, communications director for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, the agency that administers the state's Medicaid program, wrote in an email. \"Our number one priority has always been -- and remains -- insuring health care services are available to all Floridians, especially children.\"This doesn't ring true for the Muszynskis or for some other Florida families with Medicaid.Like Abby, 3-year-old Sofia Patriarca has severe epilepsy and probably will never walk, talk or even sit up by herself. Her parents recently sold their family pizzeria in Lantana and are preparing to leave Florida in December.\"Medicaid forces us to give our children subpar care,\" said Sofia's mother, Stefany Garcia-Patriarca.\"They treat them like animals instead of children,\" she said.A 6-pound, 14-ounce bundle of joyKim Lutz and Richard Muszynski (pronounced mew-ZIN-ski) met at a party in the Florida Keys that neither of them really wanted to attend.It was a few weeks before Christmas in 2004, and Kim's friends invited her to drive down to Islamorada, at the southern tip of the Keys. The party, they promised, would be epic.But Kim wasn't feeling up for fun. Recently divorced, she was a single mother to Christina, then 5, and working full-time as a paralegal at a large multinational law firm.He friends begged Kim to come, telling her she needed a break.Kim finally agreed, and her friend Susie Little spotted Rich singing in the band. She thought he looked like Kim's type -- so clean-cut -- and she introduced them.Kim asked him to play her favorite song, \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" He did, and later Rich bought her a drink and put his arm around her shoulder and pretended to be her boyfriend when a large lecherous drunk man got a little too close. Later, he told Kim he'd only come to the party because his friend in the band had lost his voice.Two years later, on the exact same date at the exact same hotel in Islamorada, Kim and Rich were married. Christina, then 7, and Katlin, Rich's 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, were the flower girls.They moved into Kim's townhouse in Boynton Beach on Florida's east coast, about an hour north of Miami, They decided to grow their family, and Kim became pregnant a few years later.Everything was going well until a little more than halfway through the pregnancy, when a routine ultrasound showed that something might not be right with the baby's brain.A followup MRI showed that the baby's brain was fine. Kim and Rich breathed a huge sigh or relief, and the rest of her pregnancy proceeded uneventfully.When Abagayle Rose Muszynski was born September 14, 2011, she was a 6-pound, 14-ounce bundle of joy.But her left eye wouldn't open.Don't worry, the doctors told Kim and Rich. It's probably just a blocked tear duct. He referred them to a pediatric ophthalmologist.\"I thought, 'OK, this is going to be fine,' \" Kim remembers.To this day, one of Kim's worst memories is watching the ophthalmologist pry open her 5-day-old daughter's eyelid with a metal instrument. Behind the lid, he found an abnormally small eyeball, a condition called microphthalmia.He told the Muszynskis that Abby would always be blind in that eye, but she could get a prosthetic eyeball and live a normal life. She seemed otherwise healthy -- but he arranged an MRI of Abby's brain just to make sure.Once again, Kim thought, \"OK, this will be fine.\"When the doctor called to give the results of the MRI, the Muszynskis instantly knew something was wrong, because he requested that both Kim and Rich come to his office and that they put their pediatrician on speakerphone.They were completely unprepared, however, for just how bad it would be.The doctor told them the MRI had found that Abby was missing a big chunk of her brain, a piece called the corpus callosum that connects the right and left hemispheres. She also had several other congenital brain defects and microcephaly, a small head.That's when the Muszynskis learned that their daughter would probably never walk or talk. She would have frequent seizures and would always need a diaper. In addition to the brain defects, she would later be diagnosed with scoliosis and cerebral palsy.The reason for all these problems was Aicardi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects about 1,000 people in the United States, almost exclusively females. There is no cure.Doctors have told the Muszynskis that their daughter probably won't live past her 20th birthday.\"I was shattered,\" said Kim. \"She was our dream baby. We were married and happy and financially OK. Our nursery was decorated perfectly. I would just sit and rock her and try to embrace the joy of our new baby, but I was so overwhelmed with sadness and hopelessness.\"A neurologist gave Kim and Rich instructions for what to do when she had her first seizure. The couple watched YouTube videos of babies having seizures to prepare for their own baby's first time.When it happened, it was still terrifying.A Christmas Day seizureIn a burgundy dress trimmed with white lace, black patent-leather shoes and a matching hair bow, Abby Muszynski celebrated her first Christmas with her parents, older sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins in Boca Raton, Florida.As the family was opening gifts, Abby had her first seizure. She was 3 months old.Her arms and legs jerked up and down. Her whole upper body bowed forward, as if she were doing a sit-up.\"Looking back, I think I'd been in denial, that she wouldn't really have seizures, or maybe they would be just mild,\" said Kim, who was changing Abby's diaper when it happened. \"So I was terrified.\"Kim yelled for Rich, who scooped up his daughter and headed for the hospital, as the neurologist had instructed. She was later sent by helicopter to Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami.\"That was the worst night of my life, to watch my baby be airlifted like that,\" Kim remembers. \"When we got to Miami, I climbed into the crib with her.\"Once out of the hospital, Abby started taking an anti-seizure drug and went into day care while Kim returned to her job at the law firm.But when the medicine didn't work, the center said it couldn't keep her.\"We looked into hiring a full-time nurse for her, but it just wasn't financially feasible,\" Kim said. \"So I resigned a job I loved. I ended my career.\"That's when the Muszynski family ended up on Florida Medicaid.Florida a 'troubled situation'When Kim quit her job -- and the health insurance that came with it -- in spring 2012, they tried to put Abby on Rich's insurance policy at his work. Inspired by his wife, he'd become a paralegal and was working at a small law firm.But the Muszynskis said it was prohibitively expensive to add Abby to Rich's policy.Their income was low enough to qualify for Medicaid. They had no way of knowing that they were joining a system that in the next few years would be harshly reprimanded by judges and the federal government for failing to provide adequate services to sick children like their daughter.In 2013, a federal judge chastised Florida Medicaid (PDF) for refusing to pay for a therapy called applied behavior analysis. The state's defense was that the therapy was experimental, even though it was considered standard treatment for autism by eight leading health agencies and organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.McManus, the spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, said in response to an inquiry from CNN that \"we have recently received approval from (the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to expand coverage of behavioral analysis services for any Medicaid eligible child for whom this service is medically necessary.\" Then in 2014, the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services threatened to cut millions of dollars in funding to Florida because the state was limiting children on Medicaid to six emergency room visits a year, in violation of federal law.In 2015, another federal judge ruled that Florida had violated the law by underpaying doctors. The state later reached a settlement (PDF) with the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the plaintiffs in the case.Later that year, a Florida judge (PDF) said the state had illegally removed thousands of children from an insurance program for children with special medical needs.Jane Perkins, legal director of the National Health Law Program, noted that this number of legal decisions against a state in just a few years is unusual and that the letter from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services threatening to withhold funds is unusual, too.\"Florida fits in that group of states that's needed courts and the federal government to tell them how Medicaid works,\" Perkins said.\"Florida is certainly a troubled situation. There's no question,\" added Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, who's studied Florida Medicaid for more than a decade.When asked about the issues that arose in previous years, McManus, the spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, pointed out that in 2013 and 2014, Medicaid in the state was transitioning to a managed care system. Such a system is defined by the US National Library of Medicine as a health insurance plan that has contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs.\"This transition has allowed our Agency to hold health plans more accountable and focus our efforts on better quality of care, enhanced access requirements and working as partners with advocacy groups who share our goal of better health care for all Floridians,\" McManus wrote in a statement.\"The cases you cite against the Agency all arose prior to the design and implementation of our new program,\" she added. \"Florida's Medicaid program is currently operating at the highest level of quality in its history.\"Almost losing AbbyAbout the same time judges were reprimanding Florida, the Muszynskis started to experience their own Medicaid struggles.The couple says that when Abby was 18 months old, her pediatrician requested that Florida Medicaid pay for a wheelchair for her, but it refused.\"I couldn't believe they wouldn't give her something as simple as a wheelchair, given her diagnosis,\" Kim said.Kim appealed the denial, and about six months later, Medicaid did pay for it.Then it got worse.About the same time her wheelchair was denied, Abby was hospitalized with pneumonia. Respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of death for people with Aicardi syndrome, as they're often too weak to cough properly, and mucus and secretions can get stuck in their airways.When Abby got out of the hospital, her doctor prescribed respiratory therapy four days a week. After every session, Abby breathed easier -- and her parents did, too.At the end of one session, the therapist packed up and turned to Kim. He said he would have to stop seeing Abby because Medicaid hadn't paid him for about six weeks. He said he felt terrible, but his agency had rules.\"We were so fearful of losing her,\" Kim said.Kim says she pleaded with Medicaid to pay the therapist but said they got nowhere. After several missed sessions, the Muszynskis could see that Abby's breathing was suffering. They paid the therapist $900, and he agreed to see her again.Kim says that at various other points, Abby's feeding, occupational and physical therapists also stopped seeing her because Medicaid hadn't paid them. Eventually, the therapists were paid, and they resumed caring for her.According to Kim, Florida Medicaid also initially refused to pay for most of the medications Abby was prescribed to prevent seizures, even though her doctors were adamant she needed those particular drugs.\"I was fighting them constantly, appealing their decisions, writing emails, arguing with them,\" Kim said.Using the skills she'd learned in her legal training, Kim says, she eventually prevailed, and Medicaid paid for the drugs.There was one medicine, however, that she couldn't get Medicaid to budge on, no matter how many hours she spent calling and emailing and arguing. It was Diastat, a drug that can stop a seizure before it kills her. Kim says Medicaid would pay for only four doses of Diastat a month, even though Abby was having about eight to 12 large, or grand mal, seizures a month.She said the family couldn't afford to pay for more doses out of their own pocket: It costs about $250 a dose, and in early 2014, when Abby was 2, Rich was laid off from his job.Kim says that about once or twice a week for nearly three years, whenever Abby had a seizure and they'd run out of Diastat, they'd call the paramedics and wait until they arrived to give Abby a dose of the drug.The paramedics were there so often, Kim and Rich gave them their garage door code.The Muszynskis panicked every time they called the paramedics, praying that Abby would keep breathing until they arrived. They also wondered about the finances of it all. Was Florida really saving money by denying Abby the Diastat? The dose cost $250, but didn't the paramedics cost more, especially as they insisted on transporting Abby to the hospital for observation?They wondered -- how much did those ambulance runs and hospital stays cost Florida taxpayers?Fighting to get what they need to surviveThe Patriarca family has wondered the same thing.Up until recently, Christian Patriarca ran the family pizzeria in Lantana, not far from the Muszynskis on Florida's east coast. His wife, Stefany Garcia-Patriarca, left her job as a hotel clerk to care for their 3-year-old daughter, Sofia, who has severe epilepsy and can't walk or talk or even sit up.She said that as with Abby, Medicaid doesn't pay for enough doses of Diastat for Sofia, and so they often have to call paramedics when they run out. Instead of paying for a $250 dose of Diastat, taxpayers pay for the paramedics to arrive and take Sofia to not one but two hospitals, as she needs to be stabilized at the closest hospital, which doesn't have neurology services, and then taken to a second hospital farther away, which does.Garcia-Patriarca also said that for regularly scheduled appointments with Sofia's neurologist at a Medicaid clinic, they used to wait for four hours in a small room crammed with about a dozen other children and their families. When the children made noise, it sometimes triggered Sofia to have more seizures.After parents complained about the wait, she said, the clinic was moved to an office with a more spacious waiting room and only two-hour waits. But that office couldn't do simple procedures like taking blood, so she'd have to take Sofia to a lab or the hospital.The extra trip was a strain on Sofia, who's medically fragile, and her family questioned the financial wisdom of a separate visit for something as simple as a blood draw.The Patriarcas, who also have a 9-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son, plan to leave Florida in December.\"We decided we just couldn't wait any longer,\" she said.Heather Rosenberg said she and her husband have also thought about leaving Florida, but they both work for the state.The Rosenbergs have extensive experience with Florida Medicaid: They've been foster parents to 16 children and adopted three of them. All of the children have been on Medicaid.She describes Florida Medicaid as \"horrible.\"\"It's an absolute nightmare,\" she said, adding that she speaks as a mother, not in her role as children's ombudsman at the Florida Department of Children and Families.Rosenberg describes many of the same problems as the other mothers, such as hours spent on the phone trying to reach someone at Medicaid to fix problems. For example, for just one issue, she had to make about seven phone calls and spend about three hours on hold.As with Abby, physical therapists and other therapists temporarily stopped seeing two of the Rosenbergs' children because Medicaid paid them late.. As the children missed appointments, their parents could see their development suffer.She said Medicaid also refused to pay for drugs prescribed by her children's doctors, but she persevered and got the decision reversed.Janice Mauro said she and her family have constantly had to fight to get her grandchildren, Charlotte and Michael Wolf, what they need.Both children, ages 4 and 2, have a neurological condition. They can't breathe on their own and are on ventilators. They'll never walk or talk or sit up and are fed by tubes that go into their stomachs.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/health-care-refugees-part-1/index.html"}

{"_id":"Help! How to lower Thanksgiving stress ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns, and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN)Writing a story about Thanksgiving stress is ironic, because I don't personally feel stressed at all as the holiday fast approaches. I keep waiting for the stress to hit me like a sledgehammer, especially since we are hosting for the first time in more than five years and my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law, whom I adore, keep asking if I'm sure I really want to host.\"Are they trying to tell me something?\" I wonder to myself.The stress will undoubtedly kick in when I start cooking turkey for only the second time in my life, along with stuffing and side dishes I'm still Googling how to make. Add in an exhausted husband and children hoping for pie before dinner -- and the pressure that Thanksgiving is my family's favorite holiday of the year -- and the anxiety begins to climb.So, what to do when you feel the stress level starting to rise? Reach out to others and ask them how they cope this time of the year.The unconventional approach Pam Rak, a married professional in Pittsburgh who is cooking for 22 family members, said the stress starts long before \"the pots and pans will come out\" because in her family, the first challenge is finding a day to celebrate that works for everyone.\"No, we don't celebrate on Thanksgiving Day. Why, you ask?\" wrote Rak, president of a national marketing firm, in an email. \"IN-LAWS! Everyone has two places to go on Thanksgiving Day, which makes all of the hard work associated with cleaning your house, cooking dinner, setting the tables go to complete waste if people rush in and have to leave to go to another dinner on the same day.\"Related: Where Thanksgiving calories hide -- and how to burn them off After having learned the hard way, she said she and her family now have their big Thanksgiving feast the day before Thanksgiving. \"It may be a bit unconventional but it works for us (after years of aggravating scheduling conflicts!)\" she said. She still needs to cook for 22 and have the meal ready a day before most of us. How does she manage? \"Cooking with lots of wine! Thankfully,\" she said.School psychologist Louise Sattler, a mom of two grown children, is planning a Thanksgiving night out. Her daughter's boyfriend is a chef and so instead of \"slaving over a hot stove,\" they'll be going to the restaurant where he works. \"Did I mention it is a kosher fusion restaurant! Nothing says Thanksgiving more than that -- huh!\" wrote Sattler, co-founder of 411 Voices, a collective of professionals with social media expertise.Ellen Williams, co-founder of Sisterhood of the Sensible Moms, has done something she hasn't quite had the courage to do before. \"In a bold move, I waved the white flag and sent out a very direct email saying I was too overwhelmed to host Thanksgiving this year,\" she wrote. \"I have never, ever let myself admit that I could not handle something before in my life but you know what? It feels good. I'm just bringing the pies to my in-laws.\"A 'plan of attack'Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two, ages 3 and 4½, and founder of the blog Tales of a Southern Sweetheart, has been hosting Thanksgiving for nine years and expects 15 people this year, her biggest crowd yet. (She usually has about five guests!) \"Thankfully, my stress levels decrease with added wisdom from each experience,\" she wrote.She used to make everything the day of Thanksgiving, which meant she was in the kitchen from 6 a.m. until the guests sat down to eat. \"And by the time everything was prepared and set out, I was too exhausted from making it all to partake!\"Related: Holiday myths debunkedNow, she splits the work up, so the dessert and a few sides are made the day before and the high priority items are made the day of. \"That helps so much!\" she said.Jessica McFadden, a mom of three and founder of the blog A Parent in Silver Spring, also always hosts Thanksgiving. Years ago, to lower the stress, she came up with her own \"plan of attack,\" which included buying \"cooking Crocs\" so she could stand up for hours in her tiled kitchen without any soreness and writing a \"to do\" list for each day leading up to the big celebration.\"The week before I order my turkey and pies from a local farm (hey, they're home baked -- just not by me!)\" she wrote. Monday, she shops; Tuesday, she starts cooking the easy sides; Wednesday more sides and picking up the turkey and pies; and Thursday, she puts the kids to work setting the table.\"When people arrive, I totally give them jobs and don't act the martyr. That makes everyone happy and part of the process,\" said McFadden, who also started the site A Parent in America. \"The most important things to do, I think, for a stress-free Thanksgiving are to pray, eat and love what you did ... and let someone else clean up.\"Avital Norman Nathman, a mom of one and editor of the motherhood anthology \"The Good Mother Myth,\" agreed that sharing the load is key, so her 9-year-old son will be making an appetizer and a dessert, her parents will bring side dishes and her husband will clean the house.\"As someone with a diagnosed anxiety disorder, 'stressed' is my default setting,\" she said. \"One thing I've learned through daily life is that it's OK to delegate tasks when you just don't have enough spoons to take on everything. The same holds true for Thanksgiving.\"'This is baad t-o-r-w-k-e-y'There is nothing like stressful Thanksgivings of the past to keep the stress of the holiday in check. One such Thanksgiving has now become \"family lore\" for Cherylyn Harley LeBon, a mom of two, and her family.After giving birth through a difficult cesarean section in late summer years ago, she and her family ordered dinner for Thanksgiving, because they were \"too exhausted to do anything more,\" the lawyer, strategist and writer said via email.Related: 11 things you'll fight over this Thanksgiving However, instead of turkey, the store gave them uncooked chicken, which they didn't realize until the store had closed. Since they don't eat chicken, they scrambled around to find something else in the freezer and found a frozen salmon dish, which they tried to pass off as turkey to their then 3-year-old daughter.\"We sat down to eat and our daughter took one bite of her salmon (faux turkey), stood up on her ... chair, pointed at the food, and shouted, 'This is baad t-o-r-w-k-e-y,' \" she wrote.\"You can't put anything over on kids, especially when it comes to turkey,\" she joked. \"No turkey that year, but a lot of laughing.\"Nationally syndicated columnist Tracy Beckerman, author of \"Lost in Suburbia: A Momoir. How I Got Pregnant, Lost Myself and Got My Cool Back in the New Jersey Suburbs,\" has her own story. For her family, \"nothing says Thanksgiving like having someone choke on a piece of Thanksgiving turkey,\" she wrote.She was about 11 years old when she remembers her grandmother gasping for air. Without missing a beat, she said her mother wrapped her arms around her grandmother and performed the Heimlich maneuver.\"The piece of turkey shot out of my grandmother's mouth, flew across the room at the speed of sound, and then hit the wall with a thud, where it stayed for the rest of the meal,\" she said. \"Once the family was assured that Grandma was OK, we all continued eating our Thanksgiving dinner, hardly mindful of the congealed turkey on the dining room wall.\"Thanksgiving isn't stressful but profitable for Kitty Bradshaw, founder of an online destination covering lifestyle in Los Angeles and New York. Because her birthday occurs the week of Thanksgiving, she tries to use it as an opportunity to \"extort money from family members who failed to remember\" her special day.\"Of course, everyone knows this and considers my annual pity party as family tradition,\" she wrote. And when she is not \"collecting birthday hush money,\" she takes on \"Thanksgiving bartender to lighten the mood and relieve the stress.\"Reality puts stress in perspective There is nothing that really puts all the stress, worry and anxiety over Thanksgiving in perspective like tragic events of our world, such as the Paris attacks.\"Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because I feel that even for a brief moment, every American gets real about getting grateful,\" said Amy Jordan, a mother of two and creator of WundaBar Pilates. \"There's power behind stopping to recognize who is important and a blessing to you in life. It takes away the power of stress by focusing on the truth of what counts.\"Related: How to talk to your kids about tragic events Bosse, the mom of two and host of Tales of a Southern Sweetheart, agreed. \"We are very fortunate to be able to sit down to a nice meal together surrounded by safety and comfort. Not all can say that. If anything, it makes you feel more thankful.\"Perhaps that's part of the reason why I can't seem to get too stressed this year even as we're hosting. No matter how the turkey, stuffing and sides turn out, I'll just feel blessed and comforted by the love I'll see around that table during these truly anxious times.What do you think is the best way to lower the stress around Thanksgiving?

{"_id":"Highlanders: The architects redefining Scotland's northern reaches","articleText":" (CNN)On the northwestern tip of the Isle of Skye, where the island's rugged terrain meets the choppy seas, a corrugated metal house is glimpsed atop a cliff. Stylistically, this eye-catching building lies somewhere between a 1960s Airstream caravan and a child's imagining of what a house should like -- all neat angles and square windows. Somehow this modern creation does not look out of place in this Highlands landscape - its silver exterior reflects the blue-grey of the surrounding skies and sea. Recycled, eco-friendly materials draw on the local landscape and ensure an air of grounded authenticity.This building, known as Tinhouse, is the brainchild of Rural Design, a RIBA-Award-winning architecture firm based on the Isle of Skye. Stunning Skye is perhaps Scotland's most famous island, renowned for its cinematic landscapes and ancient rock formations -- but not its architecture, at least not until now.Flashback two decades and the only new buildings being constructed on Skye were poor recreations of 'traditional' Highland architecture. But over the past few years, Rural Design have been quietly revolutionizing modern Scottish architecture, alongside fellow RIBA-Award-winning architecture firm Dualchas. Now, Highlanders can live in some of the most enviable homes in Britain. This is what Scots want, at least according to historian Daniel Maudlin, a lecturer in Architectural History and Theory and building inspector with Historic Scotland:\"They don't want to live in a Blackhouse, and they don't want to live in an 18th century cottage either,\" Maudlin contends.\"I think the point is that the best way to talk about the Highlands is as a modern place, and that in itself is a 200 year tradition. It's a constantly evolving, changing place.\"Scottish national identityAnyone au fait with post-Brexit politics will be aware that Scottish national identity is a politically charged topic. Architecture is always intertwined with national identity -- but it is particularly linked in the Highlands thanks to its history.Prior to the 18th century, Highlanders lived in Blackhouses - simple, stone-based longhouses designed to protect inhabitants from the country's extreme weather. But following Bonnie Prince Charlie's failed Jacobite rebellion of 1746, Highlanders were forcibly evicted from their homes. The Highland way of life was almost eradicated. Blackhouses began to disappear from the landscape. In this new era, the improved Scottish farmhouses were erected: simple white farmhouses which still dominate the hilly Highland terrain. Picture Scottish architecture and images of these white chocolate-box cottages come to mind.\"The thing about the Blackhouse, is that the Blackhouse became an emblem of shame, and of poverty,\" explains Dualchas director Neil Stephen, who founded the dynamic firm with his brother Alasdair while they were still students. \"What was traditional architecture in the Highlands just basically stopped and died -- and then it was imposed architecture, whether it was the white house traditional classical form, which was the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries template from Edinburgh, or the kit house which was a more American or suburban form.\"Dualchas aims to turn the negative associations of the Blackhouse on its head. \"What we sought to do initially at Dualchas was to try and have something that was connected to this place and inspired by this place [...] inspired by the old architecture and trying to get some sort of cultural connection,\" says Stephen.\"But then as you develop you are thinking more about the place and the environment, of the materials and updating those ideas -- and within the business when you bring in new folk and young folk, new ideas obviously develop. You can end up with very different modern architecture.\"Maudlin is quick to stress he thinks this change is good -- and exciting.\"I think it's a brilliant way of introducing new buildings into the Highlands, and much more interesting than just doing copies of old Blackhouses - or even doing copies of 18th century white cottages,\" enthuses Maudlin. \"Rural Design [...] keep exploring new things and different forms, other materials,\" agrees director Alan Dickson.\"We're trying to stand here, where we are at the moment at the beginning of the 21st century, and look forward and backwards with equal weight [...] with the view that the Highlands in the past has never stood still.\"The importance of landscapeHowever many -- including Stephen and Dickson -- would argue that celebrating the Scottish landscape goes hand in hand with celebrating Scottish cultural identity.Scotland's Landscape Charter describes landscape as \"an essential aspect of our sense of place and belonging\".The new breed of modern Scottish homes have a respectful, reciprocal relationship with their iconic surroundings.Architect Mary Arnold-Forster worked for Dualchas for 16 years. Now she works independently, designed stunning homes across the Highlands and Islands.\"The sites are amazing [...] so the inspiration comes from the site,\" Arnold-Forster explains. \"I spend a lot of time, or as much time as I can, on the site [...] at different times of year and at different times of day to see how the light changes\".Arnold-Forster notes \"the typography aspects, the geology, the flora, the surrounding built environment [...] I suppose what I'm saying is, the site is for me the generator and the start of every project.\"Her thoughts are echoed by Rural Design's Alan Dickson:\"What we really like doing is when somebody comes to us with a location for a project that has these key elements that you might think of in the landscape here, which is the sea and the sky,\" enthuses Dickson. \"I love designing a building where you have a great sunset [...] I think that's a very special moment in any day, as the sun sets particularly across the sea. We'll do anything with a project, contort or twist it maybe, to try and take advantage of that moment.\"By celebrating the Highland landscape, which is so intertwined with Highland history and culture, these homes do more to celebrate the region's traditions than copycat recreations of 18th century cottages.Elements of the cottagesThanks to the technologies of the 21st century, new buildings can showcase the surrounding landscape in a way older architecture could not.Many of the homes can showcase the spectacular landscape through large glass windows,\"Traditional Scottish buildings are very solid, very low [...] with tiny windows to protect you from the weather,\" explains Dickson, \"Whereas now we don't have that issue, now we have amazing technologies and amazing windows.\"Rural Design's Loch Duich uses its showstopping glass window to highlight the property's view across the loch towards the Five Sisters of Kintail mountain range.Other properties highlight more localized elements of the landscape. \"Clients are often interested in the big view,\" notes Arnold-Forster, \"But sometimes views of rocks or moss and heather appeal to me, just really close up views of intense landscapes, because [clients] buy these sites and they're always looking beyond them, sometimes there's something really beautiful and micro on the site.\"These buildings might be modern -- and in some cases grandiose -- but they are normally low. This means minimum impact on the scenery.In some instances, the buildings are literally submerged into their surroundings -- perhaps most strikingly in the case of Rural Design's Turf House, with its grassy roof. Building a Scotland for the futureThe popularity of Scotland's new architecture directly aids Scotland's $13.7 billion tourism industry: many Dualchas and Rural Design properties are available to rent as holiday lets. But many more are permanent homes. Looking towards the future, the architects want to encourage young Scots to stay North.\"We want the Highlands to protect itself as a modern, confident place,\" explains Stephen.\"We want it to be aspirational. A lot of people who live and work in Skye, especially young people, are aspirational about what they want the place to be and they can see the potential in it.\" Stephen also wants to encourage young Scottish designers to stay in the Highlands: \"I think that's a great thing for communities to have, for young people to stay and to be ambitious, but the older generation have to help give them those opportunities, by making sure they can get housing and set up businesses.\"The architect is optimistic, but cautious about the future:\"Design still tends to be a privilege of people who are wealthier quite often and I think that's got to change, it's got to be for everybody,\" he tells CNN, \"That's what we started off trying to do, low cost affordable homes [...] but it's not as easy as it used to be, and that is a problem.\"Meanwhile, Dickson thinks the architecture of the future must be about duality: respecting the past but looking forward to the future:\"I'm not necessarily as presumptuous to think we're going to completely change the landscape once again,\" concludes Dickson, \"But it does seem right that we should be trying to find an architecture that reflects our age, rather than reflects a time of a hundred years ago.\" ","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/architecture/scottish-modern-architecture/index.html"}
{"_id":"Hill GOP split on how to roll back Obamacare","articleText":" (CNN)On the day that President-elect Donald Trump picked a major Obamacare critic to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, congressional Republicans agree they want to repeal and replace the health care law, but they are split on how quickly it can happen.The No. 2 House Republican leader said he believes the GOP-led Congress can move ahead early in 2017 to repeal Obamacare without a plan ready for a new system to take its place.\"I don't think you have to wait,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters in a session in his Capitol office on Tuesday.But the powerful Senate Republican who will chair one of the two main panels rewriting the law cautioned against rushing things.\"We need to make sure that we do no harm, make sure that we don't make the mistakes that the Democrats made when they passed Obamacare -- which was to go too far, too fast. The goal is to get it right,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, a deal-making Republican, declining questions about specific timetables.\"I'm not sure how fast we can do it. It should begin immediately but anything this complex affecting so many people will take a good while to implement,\" Alexander said.How Trump's health secretary pick would replace ObamacareTrump, in his first post-election interview, said he wanted to roll back President Barack Obama's signature health care law and create a new program \"simultaneously.\" \"We're not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced and we'll know. And it will be great health care for much less money,\" Trump said on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" Alexander noted Trump's time line of doing both at the same time on Tuesday, saying that \"means to me that we need to figure out how to replace it before we repeal it. And I think we can do that.\"Earlier on Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan told a Wisconsin radio host that getting rid of Obamacare was \"really high up and early on the agenda.\"Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't specify any date for moving a repeal of the health care statute, but told reporters he planned to begin the process in early 2017.McCarthy argued that rolling back the law and creating a transition period for creating a new program will force Democrats to come to the table and work on a bipartisan replacement bill. \"If it is repealed then you've got an ability to get the right policy and why wouldn't you want to interject if that's the direction it's going. I would hope people wouldn't want to play politics,\" the California Republican said.But House Minority Whip, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, released a statement saying he was \"deeply concerned\" about McCarthy moving ahead with a plan to repeal the law with no strategy to address those who could lose coverage.   \"Democrats will strongly oppose these efforts, and we will continue working to ensure that affordable health coverage is accessible to all Americans,\" Hoyer said.McCarthy, like other GOP leaders, declined to give a detailed time line on when the House will vote to repeal Obamacare. But said he expected to use a budget procedure called \"reconciliation\" as a vehicle for the issue because that allows the passage of the legislation in the Senate with a simple majority, making it harder for Democrats to stymie the effort.Trump recently told The Wall Street Journal that he is considering keeping parts of the law after meeting with Obama. He nominated a longtime opponent, and physician, Georgia Rep. Tom Price, to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has worked for years on legislation to wipe away the current system and instead provide tax credits for individuals to purchase coverage in private plans.Obamacare critic is Trump's pick for health secretaryTrump ally Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, told reporters he has talked to Democrats about an effort to overhaul Obamacare. He acknowledged that Democrats may be open to some changes, but not a full replacement plan written by Republicans.\"That's right. It's a partial repeal first of all. It's not a total repeal. Let's get that out of the way. It's a partial repeal and I think there are pieces of it that have to stay in place for a while and that's what we're going to be working on,\" he said while refusing to elaborate on which parts might stay in place. McCarthy praised Price, but sidestepped a question about using Price's proposed legislation as the vehicle for putting a new structure in place. He said he planned to send a letter to governors and insurance companies to gather input on how to create a new system. He said the House would start by looking at the plan outlined in the GOP's \"Better Way\" agenda, which Price helped craft.

{"_id":"Hip-hop braces for a Donald Trump presidency","articleText":"Washington (CNN)As the reality of a Donald Trump presidency settles in, artists and activists in the hip-hop community are gearing up for a political battle.Rapper and activist David Banner predicted that a Trump presidency will continue to revitalize political activism in hip-hop and said in a message recorded on Facebook Live to his fans that Trump's win over Hillary Clinton \"may be the best thing to ever happen to black people.\"\"The veil of America has been ripped off,\" Banner said. \"Maybe Hillary winning would have kept that mask on and we would have been further pacified as a people. Now, what are we going to do as a community? What is the agenda? I'm going to stop waiting on black people having an agenda, I'm gonna create one.\"Banner argues that a Clinton win would have provided the illusion that everything is OK and would make black Americans complacent to policies that have hurt their communities.Throughout the 2016 election cycle, hip-hop, which was born as a reaction to civil unrest back in the 70s, was the most politically active genre. While artists and activists were generally not fired up about Clinton, they were overwhelmingly united in their passionate rebuke of Trump.Rapper imagines Trump's American in album, says his \"nightmare\" came trueFears over civil rightsAs the nation's first black President gets ready to leave office, deeply rooted fears are bubbling over concerns that a Trump administration could deny minorities a seat at the table and lead to the erosion of civil rights. These fears are reinvigorating political activism.\"I think that activism is going to be for the next four years at an all-time high. It's going to be reminiscent of the 60s,\" former South Carolina state representative and Clinton supporter Bakari Sellers told CNN.Common reflects on black America, Obama's legacy and the silver lining of TrumpIn a statement released following Trump's election, the Black Lives Matter movement, called on people to organize:\"Donald Trump has promised more death, disenfranchisement and deportations. We believe him. The violence he will inflict in office, and the permission he gives for others to commit violence, is just beginning to emerge. In the face of this, our commitment remains the same: protect ourselves and our communities.\"\"President-elect Trump has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he [got] elected because he will be a leader for every American,\" Trump-Pence transition spokesman Bryan Lanza said. \"To think otherwise is a complete misrepresentation of the movement that united Americans from all backgrounds.\"Following a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, DC, where attendees hailed Trump's victory, Trump denied Tuesday that he did anything to energize the \"alt-right\" movement through his presidential campaign.\"I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\" Trump told a group of New York Times reporters and columnists during a meeting at the newspaper's headquarters in New York.Rappers Ty Dolla $ign and Vic Mensa, who were outspoken opponents of Trump throughout the election, held a conference call with fans last week organized by the Hip Hop Caucus to rally their communities to vote in upcoming local elections and urged them to stay politically aware and involved.\"I had not even considered the possibility of Trump being elected and I woke up the next morning and I started to sing the National Anthem ... and realized that this isn't really my country and it's not a sweet land of liberty as far as people who look like me are concerned,\" Mensa told CNN, \"and that this wasn't my election to win or lose. The things I've been fighting for don't end here.\"While members of the hip-hop community are divided in their assessment of President Barack Obama's legacy, there is a general consensus that a Trump administration would roll back progress — whether big or small — on issues like criminal-justice reform, the war on drugs and the Department of Justice's efforts to investigate and uncover instances of police brutality and racial biases in various police departments across the nation. Concerns over Trump administration picksTrump's nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general and his appointment of Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News Steve Bannon as a chief strategist have exacerbated those concerns.\"What we're seeing with the rise of Donald Trump is the rise of white nationalism ... Trump gave them a voice and a vessel,\" Sellers said.Sessions' nomination has been dogged by old allegations of racism and racially-charged comments he made as a US attorney in Alabama, which led him to be denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago, have continued to haunt him.\"I am very concerned (about) someone with the history of Jeff Sessions, who has shown animus towards people of color and immigrants,\" Sellers said. \"It is not conducive to ensuring that all persons with alienable rights are protected.\"Sessions — a fierce opponent of the 1965 Voting Rights Act — called the ACLU and the NAACP \"un-American\" and said the organizations \"forced civil rights down the throats of people.\"\"Sen. Sessions as AG is deeply troubling, and supports an old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values,\" the NAACP tweeted.A message left with Sessions' Senate office seeking comment was not returned.Meanwhile, Bannon's appointment has appeased white nationalist groups around the country, including former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, who told CNN's KFile that Bannon is an \"excellent\" choice. Bannon previously called his site \"the platform for the alt-right\" — a far-right movement that been aligned with white nationalism, racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. \"It's frightening in certain ways to be faced with so much vitriolic ... hatred, but it's the truth,\" Mensa said. \"That's what America is. In this moment we're being forced to face the ugly truth of America and I think it's a good thing ... that we have to confront these issues head on.\"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bannon rejected white nationalism and said that he's an \"economic nationalist\" but does not support racist and anti-Semitic elements of the nationalist alt-right movement.CNN political commentator Van Jones said that while \"a real resistance to Trump's ideas and his policies,\" will revitalize political activism, he hopes that activists will be proactive in their approach. \"When so much energy has to go towards reacting against something negative as opposed to driving for it with something positive, I sometimes get worried,\" Jones said.\"We sometimes valorize and glorify street-level protests and activism ... I would much rather have people working hard to build communities, rather than working hard to block Donald Trump,\" he added.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/hip-hop-reacts-to-donald-trump-win/index.html"}
{"_id":"Hobbit holes and sci-fi monuments: Ingenious visions of the future ","articleText":"Sofia Borges is an architect, designer, curator and writer. This is an edited excerpt from her book \"The Tale of Tomorrow: Utopian Architecture in the Modernist Realm,\" published by Gestalten.  (CNN)There was a time when it seemed like blueprints, dreams, and raw concrete could change the world.We were optimistic then. We thought we could build utopia. We thought we could cast our vision of a better world in raw concrete and sweeping glass and cantilever it over the edge of our flawed present, over the chasm of our human failings, and into the open, untouched air of an ideal future -- and then live there, all of us. For thirty years or so, in the heart of the twentieth century, it felt like architecture might save the world. Read: Secrets behind the world's great buildingsHalf a century later, we turn back to look at those massed hopes and dreams, some still standing, some already crumbling, and ask: What happened to the future? When did we decide that the present was the best we were going to get?Ambition and arrogance Utopian architecture was driven by visions of how life could -- should -- be. It was informed by ideas of society reshaped to overcome divisions of class, race, and creed, to strengthen the bonds of community, to enable us to live more humanely (and to be more human), to live with and in nature. It was architecture meant to make things better.The way the utopian drive manifested itself in built form thus changed over the decades, but the drive itself stayed true: architects could provide more than just shelter -- they could free us from the flaws of earlier forms of living and usher in a new era.Read: The man behind North Korea's next generation of architectsThe very grandeur and ambition of their plans sometimes seemed to move them towards an architecture not of utopia but of dystopia. Some of the most idealistic buildings have served as the ominous settings of dystopian films, while others have been shunned, abandoned, or even rebuilt from the inside out by those fated to live or work within them. There was a certain arrogance on the part of the architects in thinking that a brave new world could simply be planned, modeled, and made. And yet that same arrogance is so full of inspiration and yearning and potential. Even today, looking back, one cannot help but feel a longing for what could have been -- and also a sense of disappointment or even resentment because their dreams failed us. What they hoped would make life better, more humane, and more livable did not. We were promised a better future and we received the present day instead.Designing a better future But in other cases, it was we who failed their dreams. We watered down their ideals, stripped back their visions, and ignored their calls to become something more.Consider modernist architecture, the school most associated with the utopian impulse: Black and white, and Brutalist. Minimalist forms creating uncomfortable spaces. Cheaply built and sometimes poorly constructed. Cracked concrete. But that is not what the real modernist utopians intended, or designed, or built. Real modernism was not minimalist.Read: The world's most beautiful contemporary cottagesIt was elegant and it was often photographed in black and white and so it appears to have been colorless, stripped down, unadorned. But many modernists played with bold splashes of color, and as much as they favored elegance, they were not all dogmatic, austere minimalists. Modernist works could holistically blend architecture, art, and product design. Our modernism is not their modernism, nor was it never meant to be. The modernism we think we know is our later perversion of their designs and ideals to create templates for saving time and cutting costs. It was our own bad faith that made much of the dystopian architecture that now surrounds us.We live in an age of coming to terms with both the atrocities and the achievements of the past. The things that could have been, the things that (regretfully) were, the feats that will endure forever, and the failures that we would like to forget. The time has come to begin again -- to design a better future.We have learned our lessons. We have the technology. Let us go forth and build new utopias.\"The Tale of Tomorrow: Utopian Architecture in the Modernist Realm\" by Sofia Borges, published by Gestalten, is out now.

{"_id":"Holocaust survivor pleads with Austrian voters: Don't let far right win ","articleText":" (CNN)An 89-year-old woman who was the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust sent a heartfelt plea to young people not to let the far-right candidate win Austria's presidential election.A video of Gertrude -- she didn't give her last name -- has gone viral with more than 3 million views since it was posted online last Friday, a little more than a week ahead of the December 4 re-run vote.\"It's probably my last election,\" said the retiree from Vienna. \"There's not much future for me. But the young have all their lives ahead of them and it's up to them to see that they continue to do well. They can only do that if they vote wisely.\"The left-leaning Alexander Van der Bellen, an independent candidate backed by the Green Party, posted the video on Facebook at Gertrude's request. He is challenging Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party in the election.At the age of 16, Gertrude, her parents and two younger brothers were deported to Auschwitz, the German Nazi concentration camp in Poland. Estimates vary, but about one million Jews are believed to have been executed at Auschwitz. According to the video, Gertrude -- who says she is not religious -- was the only member of the family to survive. 'Shiver ran down my spine'Gertrude says she is disturbed by the anti-migrant sentiment -- \"the insult towards others. The denigration. The badmouthing\" -- that she has heard during the campaign by the Freedom Party.She reminds viewers of a comment made in October by the leader of the Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache, who warned of possible civil war if the influx of migrants to the EU is not stopped.\"When Strache used the word 'civil war,' a cold shiver ran down my spine and I thought that shouldn't even be mentioned, not even be thought of,\" she says. \"I experienced a civil war as a seven-year-old and I've never forgotten it. It was the first time I saw dead bodies. Regrettably not the last.\"I've never forgotten it. It buried itself so deep in me that I'm still aware of it.\"She did not specify what happened when she was seven, but the four-day February uprising in Austria in 1934, also known as the Austrian civil war, marked the first mass European working class resistance to fascism.

{"_id":"Homeopathic kids' products recalled due to belladonna ","articleText":" (CNN)Raritan Pharmaceuticals has issued a recall of kids' homeopathic ear relief liquid and teething tablets. The recalled products contain varying levels of belladonna extract, which can be dangerous or fatal when consumed in large doses, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The recalled Raritan products include CVS Homeopathic Infants' Teething Tablets, Kids Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Oral Liquid and CVS Homeopathic Kids' Ear Relief Liquid, which are sold nationwide. The products, tested by the FDA, were found to contain small but varying amounts of belladonna. According to the agency, the recall is precautionary. There have been no reports of the recalled products directly harming consumers. \"The recall is a precautionary action,\" confirmed Sushant Pradhan, a Raritan Pharmaceuticals representative. He said the recalled products contain only about a nanogram of belladonna, which is \"not toxic to anybody.\" However, the company has not received the recent belladonna test results from the FDA, according to Pradhan. This fall, the FDA warned against using homeopathic teething tablets and gels after 10 deaths were reported. Though the causes of the deaths were not certain, the agency suggested that the homeopathic products contained potentially harmful amounts of belladonna, a toxin from a poisonous plant called deadly nightshade. Typically, the homeopathic treatments contain just trace amounts of the toxin -- a level that is supposed to be safe to consume. However, belladonna poisoning can occur when too much is ingested. Seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargy and excessive sleepiness are symptoms of belladonna poisoning, according to the FDA. When belladonna amounts are inconsistently labeled on treatments, the administration warned, children can be unknowingly exposed to dangerous doses. After the FDA's warning was released, retailers such as CVS and Walgreens withdrew the suspect homeopathic teething tablets and gels from store shelves, though the products were not officially recalled before now. Hyland's, a maker of homeopathic teething tablets and gels, discontinued distributing teething products in the US after the FDA warning. In a subsequent letter posted on its website, the company wrote, \"We are confident that any available Hyland's teething products, including those you already have, are safe for use. Of course, parents who may have concerns should consult with their physicians before using any medicines, read labels carefully and follow all instructions.\" Pradhan is similarly confident in the safety of Raritan's products. \"Belladonna can be toxic in high doses,\" Pradhan said. \"But there are very trace amounts of (belladonna) in these products.\" However, Pradhan acknowledged that there can be a wide range of belladonna levels across homeopathic treatments outside of the recalled products. Belladonna is used in several alternative medicines: it can be found in homeopathic eye drops and as a cure for upset stomach, he said. \"This is not your typical medicine,\" and homeopathic treatments should be used with caution, Pradhan said. People who use homeopathic treatments may be seeking a healthier, more natural remedy than with modern medicine, he explained, but alternative cures risk being less regulated than standard medications. The FDA advises consumers of the recalled Raritan products to immediately stop using them. If any health problems occur when using these products, consumers should consult a physician or health care provider, the FDA says. The FDA website offers a complete description of the recalled products and distribution information. Raritan Pharmaceuticals can address any further questions at 1-866-467-2748.

{"_id":"Hong Kong's banned lawmakers aren't backing down","articleText":"Hong Kong (CNN)Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus \"Baggio\" Leung would be forgiven for feeling a little shell shocked. They've gone from being stars of Hong Kong's nascent independence movement, to public enemy number one, criticized in newspapers and on television, and harassed online. In September, the pair were elected to Hong Kong's parliament, LegCo, where they joined a raft of other young lawmakers favoring greater autonomy for the city or even independence from China. \"When we were elected, our battle between the people and government was just starting,\" Yau, a 25-year-old former community worker, told CNN. That battle has escalated far quicker than anyone could imagine. On November 2, Yau and Leung were dragged from LegCo by security guards as they found themselves at the center of a legal battle that threatens to undermine the city's already shaky political system. OathgateThe saga began as lawmakers were taking their oaths of office last month. While pro-democracy politicians have used the ceremony as a venue for protest in the past, Yau and Leung took it a step further. They swore and insulted China and displayed flags with the words \"Hong Kong is not China,\" leading to their oaths being rejected, along with several other lawmakers who flubbed their vows. The pair were due to retake their oaths properly the following week when everything got a lot more complicated. Hong Kong government officials sued to prevent them being sworn-in again, arguing they had forgone their opportunity. Before the court could rule, Beijing too waded in, using a rarely-used power to re-interpret Hong Kong's constitution. Yau and Leung could not retake their oaths, and would not become lawmakers, Beijing said. This was later backed up by a Hong Kong court, though the pair are appealing. \"We were elected by over 15,000 voters,\" Leung said, adding that he was fighting to \"protect our system and the separation of powers and the rule of law.\" Yau defended the pair's protest as a tradition, pointing to occasions in the past where other lawmakers used the oath-taking session \"for a performance or chance to show their ideologies.\" Displaying the flags was just a statement of fact, Leung added, \"Hong Kong is not China.\" They would not comment on the content of their oaths, due to the ongoing appeal. What's at stake?Beijing's ruling came as a shock to much of Hong Kong. Last week, wearing black and led by a marshal holding a black umbrella, more than 2,000 lawyers marched on the city's top court, in a silent demonstration against what they saw was a blow to the city's judicial autonomy. \"This is treachery on behalf of the (Chinese government) to the Hong Kong people. How can they ever trust them again?\" said Alan Leong, a former barrister and co-founder of the pro-democracy Civic Party, adding that Beijing's ruling was \"completely unnecessary.\" The fear is that Beijing's interpretation, which requires officials to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong as an inalienable part of China, will undermine judicial independence and the \"one country, two systems\" principle under which the city is governed. \"By preventing the two pro-independence politicians from taking office, the Chinese government has opened the door to disqualify anyone from Hong Kong's government if they are determined to not be loyal to Beijing,\" pro-democrat lawmaker Claudio Mo wrote in an op-ed after the ruling. Some fear that Beijing is also indicating a willingness to change the constitution at will. Before the most recent interpretation, the power had only been used four times in the past 19 years.Why did Beijing act?The oath-taking saga comes amid increasing support in Hong Kong for independence from China, which has caused concern and outrage in Beijing. In the run-up to the LegCo elections in September, several pro-independence candidates were banned from taking part, including Edward Leung (no relation to Baggio), then the city's most famous separatist politician. Yau and Leung's actions \"hit the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle and posed a grave threat to national sovereignty and security,\" China's top lawmaking body said in a statement this month.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week that \"pro-independence forces in Hong Kong want to split the nation.\" Leung accused his and Yau's critics of \"blaming the victim,\" and argued that it is Beijing which has fostered support for independence through its heavy-handed actions.\"They're the ones who caused a generation of Hong Kongers to think that 'one country, two systems,' isn't working,\" he said. Yau added that people should recognize the arrangement is \"a failed experiment, no country would choose to rule a city in this way.\" If Hong Kong does not become independent, she said, then it is just the same as any other Chinese city. Divided cityDespite widespread outrage over Beijing's intervention, including mass protests, Yau and Leung have also come in for a whirlwind of criticism, even from anti-Beijing quarters. Chinese state media said that it was \"the will and demand of the entire population of China\" that the pair be ejected, and pro-Beijing groups staged a protest against them holding signs such as \"Yau and Leung get out of China.\" While other pro-democrat lawmakers have largely stood in solidarity with the pair, outside LegCo reaction has been decidedly mixed, with some supporters even expressing frustration over Yau and Leung's actions. \"The most prevalent sentiment is that Yau and Leung have overplayed their hands -- and rather unnecessarily so,\" said Jason Ng, a lawyer and author of \"Umbrellas in Bloom: Hong Kong's occupy movement uncovered.\" \"By doing what they did, they have not only damaged their own politics careers, but they have also jeopardized those of other anti-establishment lawmakers.\" Intense criticismWhile Yau and Leung said they are determined to keep fighting to the end (the case has not yet reached Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal), it is clear events are taking their toll. Leung said he was moved to tears reading an article quoting his election volunteers' despair and dejection after months of work to get him his seat was wasted.\"Most Hong Kongers are sympathetic to us,\" Yau said. At times however, criticism has turned personal. The youngest woman ever elected to LegCo, Yau has frequently been the target of offensive and sexist comments, and at a protest last month pro-Beijing groups displayed a naked sex doll with her face on it.While Yau denied that her gender has been a factor, she said the criticism has made her family worry for her safety.  Paraphrasing a song lyric by Canto-rock singer Candy Lo, Leung said he could handle being \"abandoned by the world\" so long as he had something to love. \"Hong Kong is like a sinking ship,\" he said, but one he hoped to save.

{"_id":"Hot car deaths: How can parents forget a child in a car?","articleText":"I have been studying the brain and memory since 1980, but I was baffled when a news reporter asked me in 2004 how parents can forget that their children are in the car with them. It seemed incomprehensible that parents could leave a child in a car and then go about their daily activities, as their child dies of hyperthermia in a car that reaches scorching temperatures.My first inclination was to assume negligent parenting. Then I learned from a children's advocacy group that more than 100 children had died as a result of being mistakenly left in cars since the 1990s. None of those cases had evidence of prior abuse or neglect by their parents.I then spoke with many of these parents. I heard the gut-wrenching 911 calls they made after their child was found dead. I have realized that, in the vast majority of cases, this was not the act of uncaring or negligent parents.Since I began studying forgotten children in cars in 2004, more than 300 additional children have died or suffered brain damage as a result of being left in hot cars.Three times as many children have died this year over last year after being left inside cars that overheat, the National Safety Council reported in early June. It's a good time to remind ourselves about the dangers of children being left in parked cars -- and also to examine what causes and what can possibly prevent these tragedies.Memory systems of the brain competeAs a neuroscientist, I have studied this phenomenon from neurobiological and cognitive perspectives. I have interviewed parents, studied police reports, served as an expert witness in civil and criminal cases and contributed to media segments and documentaries on the topic.Based on my research and my expertise, I have developed a hypothesis as to how this tragedy occurs. This type of memory failure is the result of a competition between the brain's \"habit memory\" system and its \"prospective memory\" system -- and the habit memory system prevails.Prospective memory refers to the planning and execution of an action in the future, such as planning to take a child to daycare. Habit memory refers to tasks that involve repetitive actions that are performed automatically, as in routinely driving from one location to another, such as from home to work.Prospective memory is processed by two brain structures, the hippocampus, which stores all new information, and the prefrontal cortex, which is essential to making plans for the future. The hippocampus provides access to one's awareness that a child is in the car. The prefrontal cortex enables a parent to plan a route, including the plan to bring their child to the daycare, rather than to drive straight to work.The habit brain memory system is centered on the basal ganglia, which enables people to perform repetitive tasks automatically. Examples of habit memory abound in our daily lives, including tasks such as riding a bike or tying shoelaces. It also applies in regard to children unknowingly left in cars. When we repeatedly drive along a fixed route, as between home (or other typical start locations) and work, habit memory can supersede plans stored in our prospective memory.A suppression of prospective memory caused by the dominance of the brain's habit memory system is an almost daily occurrence. It happens, for example, when we forget to interrupt a drive home to stop at the store for groceries. In this case, the habit memory system takes us directly home, suppressing our awareness (prospective memory) that we had planned to stop at the store.Drunk driving laws don't match the researchThe magnitude of prospective memory failures, however, is not always so benign as forgetting to buy groceries. There are documented examples of memory-related tragedies: pilot memory failures are a significant threat to flight safety, police officers forget their loaded guns in public restrooms and service dogs have died of hyperthermia after they were forgotten in cars.Therefore, our flawed prospective memory puts those we love at risk. This is especially true when we assume that precautions are not necessary because such tragedies happen only to negligent parents. The evidence is clear that this assumption is wrong.Change in routine, stress contribute to lapsesAlthough each case is different, the cases tend to share factors in common that contribute to children being left in cars: a change in the parent's routine that leads him or her to follow an alternate, but well-traveled, route; a change in how the parent interacted with the child during the drive, such as when a child might have fallen asleep en route; and a lack of a cue, such as a sound or an object associated with the child -- for example, a diaper bag in plain view.Typically, there was a choice point during the drive where the parent could go to daycare or to another a destination (usually work or home). At that choice point the parents report having lost awareness that the child was in the car.Parents who have forgotten their children in cars often report stressful or distracting experiences before or during the drive. Many also report sleep deprivation.The stress and sleep deprivation factors are important, as they are known to bias brain memory systems toward habit-based activity and to impair prospective memory processing. Ultimately, all or a subset of these factors have caused parents to follow a well-traveled route, controlled by their brain habit memory system, that did not include stopping at the daycare.What happens in the brain when you no longer need information?In theory, therefore, activation of the habit memory system suppressed their prospective memory system. This caused them to lose awareness of the presence of their child in the car.A universal observation I have made is that each parent's brain appears to have created the false memory that he or she had brought the child to daycare. This scientific anomaly explains why these parents went about their routine activities, which even included telling others that they needed to leave work on time to retrieve their child from daycare. Having this \"false memory\" caused them to be oblivious to the fact that their child had remained in the car all day.Explainer: What is forgetting?Many of these parents have been charged with manslaughter or even murder. I do not think that incarcerating parents for the deaths of their children in these cases is appropriate. The hijacking of prospective memory by habit memory, and the parent's loss of awareness of a child's presence in the car, is a tragic way for us to learn how the brain can malfunction when it is in \"memory multi-tasking mode.\" There is no indication in the cases I have studied that these parents demonstrated an act of willful recklessness or gross negligence for the child's welfare.Finally, how do we stop this tragedy? The first step is to accept that human memory is faulty and that loving and attentive parents can unintentionally leave their children in cars. Many strategies have been suggested, such as using a phone app linked to an occupied car seat, but most people refuse to take any precautionary measures because they believe this could never happen to them, a potentially fatal mistake.Some progress has been made by General Motors, which has developed a child reminder system for its cars. Although I applaud GM's efforts, they have chosen to apply this lifesaving technology to only one of their models. To ensure that no more children will die in hot cars, it is urgent that legislation mandates that a child reminder system be standard equipment in all cars.David Diamond is a professor of psychology, molecular pharmacology and physiology and director of the Neuroscience Collaborative Program and Center for Preclinical and Clinical Research on PTSD at the University of South Florida.Copyright 2016 The Conversation.

{"_id":"House Democrats to offer bill on Russia vote hacking","articleText":"Washington (CNN)House Democrats are set to introduce legislation Wednesday calling for a formal probe into Russian cyber hacking in the 2016 election, part of a broader Democratic push to shed light on unprecedented foreign interference in a US voting season.Leading national security Democrats in the House also asked the White House on Tuesday to share classified information on Russian hacking with Congress, saying in a letter that Moscow \"may have succeeded in weakening American's trust.\" \"We are deeply concerned by Russian efforts to undermine, interfere with and even influence the outcome of our recent election,\" said the letter, signed by Adam Schiff, the most senior Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and six others. \"By eroding Americans' and foreigners' trust in US institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global instability and uncertainty.\"The House legislation, to be announced Wednesday, according to California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, is one of several Democratic efforts to shine a brighter light on Russia's cyber activities. The initiatives could lead to a clash with Republicans and will almost certainly cause tension with the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed admiration for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and a desire to work more closely with Moscow. During the campaign, Trump dismissed the assessment by all 17 US intelligence agencies that Russia was responsible for thefts and disclosures that were \"intended to interfere with the US election process.\" Instead, Trump suggested the hacks could be the work of \"someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\" In contrast, Putin and the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had a long history of mutual criticism and clashes. The hacked information, published through sites like WikiLeaks, was exclusively from Democratic organizations and individuals, including Clinton's campaign chairman. Now, the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling wasn't just meant to roil the presidential election, but was explicitly intended to support Trump, CNN has reported, based on multiple sources. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. The House Democrats' letter to the White House Tuesday comes on top of an earlier letter sent by seven Senate Democrats that called for the Obama administration to publicly release information showing that the Russian interference was explicitly meant to help Trump.

{"_id":"How Atlanta proved black and blue lives matter ","articleText":"Atlanta (CNN)Before #BlackLivesMatter became a trending hashtag, before names like Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald and Walter Scott filled national headlines, before protesters took to the streets of Charlotte and Baltimore, Atlanta Police had a moment of reckoning. Several officers killed an elderly woman named Kathryn Johnston in a botched drug raid. Johnston's death, which occurred 10 years ago this week, forced the Atlanta Police Department to undergo a major series of reforms. But did reforms actually change anything? We revisited the case -- talking with officials, activists, and police about the shooting -- to see how Johnston's death impacted Atlanta.Why did Kathryn Johnston die?On a rainy Tuesday evening, two days before Thanksgiving 2006, Kathryn Johnston, a lively 88-year-old black woman, was inside her yellow brick ranch at 933 Neal Street. Her family was planning to come by for their annual feast.  Johnston had lived near English Avenue since the late '80s. Since then, the historic neighborhood where black working-class families once prospered had fallen on hard times. It became known as the \"The Bluff\" and had turned into the South's largest open-air heroin market, according to the FBI.Johnston, used to the drugs and prostitutes, felt unsafe after an elderly woman had recently been raped. A friend came over to clean her old .38 revolver. She wouldn't be taking any chances.Around 7 p.m., eight Atlanta Police officers approached Johnston's property without warning. They pried off burglar bars attached to the wooden door and used a ram to bust inside. Johnston, who had grabbed her gun, fired a single shot that zipped past the police. APD officers unleashed a hail of gunfire, 39 bullets in total. Five pierced her body.\"They shot her down like a dog,\" Sarah Dozier, Johnston's niece, told reporters outside Grady Memorial Hospital.It was a botched drug raid that went horribly wrong -- police knowingly acted based on false pretenses, and then tried to cover up their actions.Johnston's death grabbed international headlines, prompted a civil rights probe, and led to a congressional hearing. Three APD officers pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. They went to prison.\"People in communities of color believed officers in certain APD departments operated as a band of thugs,\" civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis said. \"The exposure was too much to turn a blind eye.\"Following Johnston's death, local officials pledged to review practices and make reforms. It all happened years before police shooting victims' names were popularized into hashtags -- all while hundreds of other minority men and women became victims of police brutality. A decade later, the department's changes have largely spared Atlanta the anger and conflict that followed police-involved deaths in such cities as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland.\"Her killing was heart-wrenching and tragic,\" said former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who oversaw the changes after Johnston's death. \"The expressions of horror helped all of us in Atlanta refocus on the value of human life.\"'A complicated set of errors'On the afternoon of November 21, 2006, narcotics officer Jason Smith was feeling pressure to meet his unwritten quota of nine arrests and two executed search warrants each month, federal investigators learned while interviewing APD officers. According to a report from the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, Smith and two other APD officers -- Gregg Junnier and Arthur Tesler -- told federal investigators such quotas were in place. APD has long denied such a policy was ever enforced.The three officers detained a suspected drug dealer named Fabian Sheets, according to court filings. After a search turned up nothing of substance, Smith planted marijuana near Sheets, which a canine officer then found, an FBI investigation revealed. Faced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence Sheets told the officers he knew of a kilo of cocaine that could be found inside a shoebox at 933 Neal Street -- Johnston's address.The tip had the potential, if true, to yield one of APD's biggest seizures of the year. The officers submitted paperwork for a \"no-knock\" search warrant -- which would permit them to enter the house without warning. A judge quickly approved the warrant. The raid was on.There was just one problem: The paperwork said a man named \"Sam\" had sold two $25 baggies of crack to a confidential informant at 933 Neal Street. That informant, a drug dealer named Alexis White, didn't actually buy the drugs. White told federal investigators he was asked to make a buy for APD, but he couldn't get there in time because he didn't have a ride.The plain-clothed officers busted down the door anyway.From the archive: Informant denies buying drugs","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/us/atlanta-police-kathryn-johnston-lessons-learned/index.html"}
{"_id":"How Gary Johnson and Jill Stein helped elect Donald Trump","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Neither Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nor the Green Party's Jill Stein managed to make a dent in the Electoral College, but they did post a significant enough showing in several states arguably to help elect Donald Trump. Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to 232 for Hillary Clinton, as of Wednesday evening, with Clinton topping him in the popular vote. But had the Democrats managed to capture the bulk of third-party voters in some of the closest contests -- Wisconsin (10), Pennsylvania (20), Michigan (16) and Florida (29) -- Clinton would have defeated Trump by earning 307 Electoral College votes, enough to secure the presidency. The entire scenario conjures up memories of Ralph Nader's Green Party run in 2000. Nader's share of the vote in that year's razor-thin Florida contest was 1.63%, according to the final totals from the Federal Election Commission. Bush won the state by just .05%, which tipped the Electoral College in his favor. (Nader has for years denied his candidacy played a role in Bush's 2000 victory.)It's impossible to know how an election could have gone under hypothetical scenarios, but the Johnson campaign regularly said they thought they were pulling support equally from would-be Trump supporters and would-be Clinton voters. Stein's campaign, meanwhile, made a constant, explicit appeal to disenchanted Democrats and former supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. If Johnson and Stein weren't in the race, it's also possible many of their supporters may have stayed home. But if about half of Johnson's supporters would have voted for Clinton over Trump, and if most of Stein's supporters broke for the Democrats, the electoral map would have been decidedly different.For what it's worth, both Johnson and Stein have in repeated interviews with CNN taken offense at the notion they would spoil the race. Johnson said he hoped his candidacy would wipe out the two-party system and, in a recent MSNBC appearance, literally held his nose shut at the mention of Clinton and Trump. Stein said she would not \"sleep well\" in the event of a Clinton or Trump presidency and suggested Clinton would be more likely to start a nuclear war than the current president-elect.However, Johnson's running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, took a different tack. He defended Clinton regularly and argued Trump was a unique threat to the United States.Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Hunter told CNN on Thursday \"the Johnson/Weld campaign was clearly a factor\" and cited Colorado as a place where the Libertarian presidential campaign may have actually benefited Clinton.\"To the extent that independents and others found a voice through our campaign, were heard, and impacted the outcome, that is success -- and ultimately an important step toward breaking the two-party hold on the system,\" Hunter said.Also in a response on Thursday, Stein campaign press director Meleiza Figueroa dismissed any impact the Green Party may have had on the presidential election, citing the campaign's marginal showing in battleground states.\"There is no way statistically we could have been a \"spoiler\" for the outcome of the election,\" Figueroa said. \"In any case, the solution to a potential 'spoiler' scenario should never be to silence political opposition and limit democracy to two corporate-sponsored choices.\"Here's the breakdown of what might have been, based on available totals for the key states:Florida (29 electoral votes)Trump stood 119,770 votes ahead of Clinton, with 99% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 270,026 votes -- well more than double Trump's margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.Michigan (16 electoral votes)Trump stood 11,837 votes ahead of Clinton, with 96% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 223,707 votes -- almost 20 times more than the margin as of this writing. CNN has not yet projected a victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it could have delivered a Democratic win here.Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes)Trump stood 68,236 votes ahead of Clinton, with 99% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 191,565 -- almost three times Trump's margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.Wisconsin (10 electoral votes)Trump stood 27,257 votes ahead of Clinton, with 95% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 137,422 votes -- about five times Trump's margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here.If half of Johnson's supporters and all of Stein's supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/gary-johnson-jill-stein-spoiler/index.html"}
{"_id":"How Grindr got men to self-test for HIV","articleText":" (CNN)Grindr, a dating app for gay men, was found to be an effective way to give out HIV self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of HIV, according to a recent study. The study targeted black and Hispanic Grindr users in Los Angeles, a high-risk population that is often untested for HIV. Gay-related and HIV-related stigma and lack of access to health care often keep these men from getting tested, according to Dr. A. Lina Rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.With a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. If the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation. Researchers offered free access to these HIV home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on Grindr. Clicking on the ads took users to the study's website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. They were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested. The researchers chose Grindr because of its popularity among gay men in Los Angeles. The app attracts 2 million daily active users in 192 countries, according to its website. The study's website received 4,389 unique visits over four weeks and 333 test kit requests.Among the 125 participants who answered the first survey, 74% reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the past three months. Twenty-nine percent were last tested for HIV more than a year ago, and 9% had never been tested for HIV.Of the 56 users who took the follow-up survey, two tested positive for HIV. Still, 77% of those users preferred testing at home to doing so in clinical settings.The pilot study, spearheaded by the University of California, Los Angeles, is part of a larger effort to incorporate HIV self-testing with mobile technology. \"We were surprised about the number of people who were willing to engage with us in health prevention through mobile apps,\" Rosengren said. \"People are comfortable receiving and giving fairly private health information through mobile technology.\"She hopes the study can inspire future efforts in HIV prevention and more research that finds ways to bridge the gap between HIV testing and early, proper treatment.The FDA has approved two types of home HIV tests, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"_id":"How Jeff Sessions could change the Justice Department","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Under the Obama administration, Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch dedicated Justice Department resources to areas such as civil liberties, voting rights, same-sex marriage, environmental and consumer protection.Elections have consequences, however, and President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions, has a new mandate.Sessions, the 69-year-old Alabama senator, is likely to change course and place a greater emphasis on more traditional criminal law areas such as drug and immigration enforcement. He would take a narrow view of the scope of federal authority in other areas and emphasize deference to the states.Resources aren't endless, and as head of the department, Sessions will have to consider where to devote his. Under the Obama administration, for example, DOJ brought a lawsuit challenging Arizona's controversial immigration law. Its lawyers also fought back hard against a lawsuit brought by states challenging the President's executive orders on immigration. And in the area of gay rights, the administration chose not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in 2011, a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\"The average American may have a hard time seeing how shifts in enforcement priorities within the Justice Department affect their daily lives, but the impact can be substantial,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.\"Whether it's in how much (or how little) to enforce anti-discrimination laws against local governments or private employers, how aggressively to enforce (or not enforce) drug laws, or taking a different position on the relationship between the federal government and the states with respect to immigration, the environment and other hot-button topics, how resources are allocated has potentially monumental substantive policy implications,\" Vladeck added.\"Sessions will bring a dramatically different ideological vision for the role of the Justice Department, \" said Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University. \"This will occur across the board and because of his years on the Senate Judiciary committee, his influence may also extend to judicial nominations.\"Critics of Sessions are preparing for the worst. They say a man who has encouraged the investigation of Hillary Clinton, and who himself lost a chance to serve on the federal judiciary in 1986 after allegations of racism, shouldn't get the job as America's top lawyer.\"It is a blatantly inflammatory act in a time of heightened focus on violence and injustice of communities of color,\" said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. One area that Sessions is sure to target is immigration.Immigrant rights attorneys -- still stung by the fact that Obama's executive orders were blocked-- were quick to respond to the nomination, saying it should \"send chills down the spines of all Americans.\"\"Under Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions has been pushed from the fringe into the center of American politics,\" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \"As a result, women, immigrants, the Black community, the LGBTQ community and anyone who cares about justice and equality for all being are being pushed out.\"But Sen. Ted Cruz, who himself was under consideration for the post, struck back at Sessions' critics at an appearance at the conservative Federalist Society on Friday and said that Sessions is a necessary change of course from the Obama years.\"We need all hands on deck,\" Cruz said, and noted that many of the lawyers in the room might land in the new administration. \"Do not follow the example of the previous administration,\" he warned, speaking about the need for deregulation and a reining in of the power of administrative agencies.\"We must rebuild our legal culture,\" Cruz said.Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society who has met with Trump concerning Supreme Court nominees, agreed.\"The one thing you have to know about Jeff Sessions,\" said Leo, \"is that he believes deeply in the rule of law.\"\"He is going to want to have a Justice Department that is a most fitting example of an institution committed to the rule of law, integrity and getting it right legally, because that's what he believes in. \"Supporters of Sessions say he will help change the way Washington works.\"He is not intimidated by the liberal media or the Washington establishment,\" said Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation. \"He should easily be confirmed.\"The Alabama senator is on his home court before his colleagues in the Senate, and already has the backing of one Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.\"He knows Senator Sessions, considers him a friend's and believes he can work with him,\" Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott told CNN.But he won't get a free pass.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, set to take over as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, warned it might not be smooth sailing.\"Senator Sessions has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for many years so he's well aware of the thorough vetting he's about to receive,\" she said. \"While many of us have worked with Sen. Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee.\"CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/jeff-sessions-justice-department/index.html"}
{"_id":"How Pope Francis is shaking up the Vatican","articleText":"Rome (CNN)Pope Francis is showing his love for outsiders again -- this time by turning some of them into the ultimate insiders.He's appointing a batch of new cardinals on Saturday, reshaping the group that will someday choose the next pope.Many of the new men come from lands far distant from Rome: Three are from Africa, two from Asia, one from Oceania, and one from the Middle East. All represent places where the Catholic population is in the minority.Meanwhile, some major cities usually led by a cardinal -- including Los Angeles and Philadelphia -- are being bypassed this time around.Some things will not change. Europe will continue to dominate geographically, and the College of Cardinals isn't getting much younger: The most common age for a cardinal is 83.But in his 3½ years as Pope, Francis has put in place nearly a quarter of the cardinals, the \"princes of the Church.\" (John Paul II still exerts huge influence: Four out of 10 current cardinals were appointed during his papacy.)Confronting Christian-Muslim violenceIn part, Francis has chosen men who are involved in a daily battle with poverty, violence and religious conflict. Dieudonne Nzapalainga, 49, will become the first cardinal from the war-torn Central African Republic, one of the poorest countries in the world. He'll also be the youngest of the 229 members of the College of Cardinals.Nzapalainga is known as one of the \"saints of Bangui\" for his efforts to calm Muslim and Christian militia violence in a fight over the Central African Republic's important diamond and mineral resources. Pope Francis visited the capital of Bangui in 2015.In Bangladesh, Patrick D'Rozario, 73, leads a small Catholic population of around 350,000 in the Muslim-majority country of 153 million. As the archbishop of Dhaka, D'Rozario was on the front lines when a deadly terror attack struck the capital in July. Francis plans to visit Bangladesh in 2017.Francis is also shining a spotlight on Syria by appointing his Italian-born ambassador to Damascus, Mario Zenari, a cardinal. The Pope says the appointment shows his closeness to the \"beloved and martyred Syria.\"Papua New Guinea, in Oceania, is threatened by climate change, and Cardinal-elect Archbishop John Ribat has been an outspoken proponent of reducing carbon emissions. Mother Teresa declared a saintUnexpected American choicesThe United States has three new cardinals, but even these, it might be said, come from the peripheries.Francis made a surprise appointment in Monsignor Joseph W. Tobin, from Indianapolis, who will become the Cardinal of Newark, New Jersey, a city that has never before had a cardinal. Tobin will replace Archbishop John Myers, who came under criticism over his handling of sex abuse cases and for excessive spending on his residence.In Chicago, the Pope surprised many when he appointed an outsider, Blase Cupich, in September 2014 to lead the archdiocese. Cupich was also appointed to be a special delegate to the Synod of Bishops on the family in 2015, and he was seen to be in the progressive camp on divorced and remarried Catholics and outreach to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. The Irish-born Monsignor Kevin Joseph Farrell, the former bishop of Dallas, has been appointed to lead the Vatican's new office for laity, family and life.Creating cardinals is an important way for the Pope to leave his stamp on the Catholic Church. Francis' choices show a move away from traditional conservative-liberal theological categories and toward men who are doing practical work of helping the poor, immigrants and the planet.

The opinions in this article are those of the author. (CNN)It has been hard to remain optimistic about peace as Syrian civilians have died, been displaced or had their homes destroyed in this man-made, unnatural disaster. What began as peaceful protests for democracy were crushed by a dictator.The actions and inactions of powerful international actors has made Syria an arena for their proxy wars and enabled Islamist terrorist groups to flourish. Readers could be forgiven for thinking that there is no hope, especially given the catastrophe in Aleppo.Yet a credible path to a meaningful, enduring peace exists and is perhaps more viable now, in light of Donald Trump's election.The Syria's Tomorrow Movement, which I helped found earlier this year, advocates a different strategy to that of the official opposition, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC). We are led by former SNC President Ahmed Jarba and share the SNC's objectives of a transition away from dictatorship towards a pluralistic, democratic Syria. But we differ in that we believe these long-term ideals can only be achieved through hard-headed realism that accepts the prevailing geostrategic situation and the facts on the ground.The status quo is the result of a litany of failure on all sides. The opposition failed to form coherent political and military institutions and to separate itself from the Al Nusra Front.Bashar al-Assad failed to pursue politics, choosing instead the response of dictators down the ages: a brutal war against his own people.Regional countries failed to establish a coordinated strategy to help the opposition, instead competing with one another, leading to the fracturing of opposition groups.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/opinions/trump-syria-war-opinion/index.html"}
{"_id":"How Trump should use Twitter","articleText":"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \"Jimmy Carter\" and \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\" He is the co-host of the podcast Politics & Polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)It doesn't seem like President-elect Donald Trump is going to stop tweeting any time soon. Unless his advisers take away his Internet access, the basic means of communication that he used as a candidate will become his bully pulpit as president for the next four years. He will continue to provide, in 140-character bursts, nonstop commentary from the Oval Office and -- on the weekends -- from Trump Tower in New York City.This past weekend, \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a blistering skit, with Alec Baldwin as Trump, obsessing over retweeting the rants of his followers, from high schoolers on up, instead of paying attention to security briefings from officials who are having trouble swallowing that the inauguration is weeks away. Of course, in real life, Trump couldn't resist tweeting a response: \"Just tried watching Saturday Night Live -- unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad.\" There are some virtues to what he has done. Every so often, a new president displays a feel for media and demonstrates how it can be used to make his case politically. In the right hands, Twitter could indeed become a powerful way for elected officials to break through some of the rigid barriers imposed by the news media, interest groups and partisan leaders. As with radio in the 1930s, back when many Americans felt that Franklin D. Roosevelt was speaking directly to them in their living rooms amid a horrendous economic crisis, Twitter creates a sense of intimacy, letting citizens know what is going on and connecting them to their politicians.But that's not what we've seen from most of Donald Trump's tweets. Perhaps before he starts his time in the White House, it would be useful to lay down a few of the ground rules about what politicians should avoid when they start to tap characters into the \"What's Happening\" box and instantly share them with the world. Some rules: Don't tweet about foreign leaders and foreign policy One of the most difficult parts of serving as the commander in chief is handling the delicacies of foreign policy. Each statement uttered by the president of the United States can have huge ramifications, even creating dangerous situations for our military and our citizens. Some Soviet leaders were reportedly shaken when word leaked that President Reagan, who was joking, said during a microphone check before a 1984 news conference: \"My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\" International relations are extremely tricky, given that the president is dealing with so many nations, each with its own history, its own perception of events, its own internal tensions. When foreign leaders hear or read something from the president, they will naturally read into the statement some kind of signal about what the US might do.It's not always easy to know when someone is joking. The wrong statement can easily insult a leader or even instigate a movement in another country, resulting in violence or the breakdown of diplomatic relations. So when Fidel Castro passes away, tweeting \"Fidel Castro is dead!\" is exactly the kind of tweet that can't be acceptable.Trump's tweets after Castro's death, including \"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal,\" amounted to diplomatic threats.After coming under criticism for taking a call from the president of Taiwan, breaking four decades of diplomatic practice, Trump responded by firing off more tweets:  \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\" And then: \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" as he sank deeper into potentially threatening a showdown with China. Soon after this happened, China lodged a complaint with the United States about what the President-elect had done. \"We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the 'one China' policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiqués, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship.\"What did Trump do? Push out tweets critical of China's handling of its currency and of its actions in the South China Sea.Don't offer knee-jerk reactions to terrorismOur national security challenges require great caution from leaders. With terrorism as the major threat that we face on a daily basis, elected officials have the difficult job of keeping calm amidst tragedy and remaining extremely cautious when making statements about what has happened in a given event: the wrong words can dangerously inflame passions or provide skewed interpretations.Many older Americans will remember how the media initially blamed Muslims for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, although it turned out that white nationalists were behind the carnage. The role of the leader is to maintain a national security infrastructure that protects citizens, to guide Americans through troubled times and to maintain calm as the government responds to acts of violence. His job is not to target particular social groups or make poorly informed statements about public policy.After the recent Ohio State University shooting, Trump responded: \"ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.\" It seems inevitable, unfortunately, that during Trump's presidency there will be more acts of violence, and he would do better if he refrained from using this medium to make statements about what happens, other than to offer calming words.Don't attack individual reporters or specific media organizations It is absolutely vital to the health of our democracy that journalists feel that they have the freedom and the space to produce honest accounts of what's going on in Washington and to offer readers and viewers hard-hitting stories about our nation's leaders. To be sure, they shouldn't expect that this will be easy. Presidents have often lashed out against the press when they come under attack; recall President Nixon's hostility to the press and his vice president, Spiro Agnew, commenting on the \"nattering nabobs of negativism.\"In his recent tweets, Trump has gone after specific people. When CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported that there was no evidence to support Trump's assertion of massive voter fraud, Trump retweeted aggressive statements from his followers -- \"what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist do your job!\" and \"just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist!\"After a few more of those, Trump issued his own blast against @CNN. These kinds of tweets should not be part of the presidential arsenal. In an atmosphere that quickly turns hostile and aggressive (many Jewish journalists, for instance, found themselves under attack from anti-Semites during this campaign) the president can't legitimize such practices. Journalists may become scared of reporting on the facts, and news organizations may fear punitive action against them for being too tough on the White House.Don't spread false allegationsThe thing about Twitter is that there are no editorial filters. When the president makes a claim, it instantly goes out to all his followers, becomes the subject of reporting and national conversation and can quickly be seen as the truth. While it is true that all presidents tell lies, it has only been a few weeks since the election, and we have seen the President-elect make a series of stunning claims that have no foundation in serious evidence. Many were taken aback when Trump tweeted that \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" Trump went on to claim that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in states like Virginia, New Hampshire and California. Not only is his claim patently false, but it undermines public confidence in the election process without any justification, continuing a strategy he employed in the final month of his election when he couldn't stop speaking about a \"rigged election.\"More troubling is the fact that this assertion will lend support to the ongoing campaign among some conservatives to make voting more difficult and cumbersome through voter fraud laws. In an era when it is becoming harder to tell fact from fiction, the president must be an apostle of truth, demonstrating extreme discipline and not putting out false claims that produce dangerous decisions. Don't threaten individuals or individual businessTwitter is not an appropriate mechanism for the president, or president-elect, to start issuing threats. In one of his recent tweets, Trump started to threaten any business that moved its factories overseas with a 35% tariff. Most economic experts are dubious that the president would have this legal authority. But even if he did, Twitter is not a platform for the president to use his authority to try to scare people into action. This can have dangerous consequences for the market and for civil liberties. Given Trump's extensive business interests -- and it is unclear if he is planning to let go of any of them while he is president -- this will also cause concerns about how he might be using his office to advance his own economic interests. The Twitterverse is already toxic enough. There is no room for the president to fuel that atmosphere.The power to tweet is serious when one is the leader of an entire country. Donald Trump already demonstrated some of the destructive ways this tool could be used during the campaign. The costs were already high then, as some of his statements encouraged a new level of vitriol and anger than we ordinarily see in America. In the hands of the most powerful politician in the country, and one of the most powerful individuals in the entire world, one wrong tweet can have disastrous consequences.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/opinions/how-trump-should-use-twitter-zelizer/index.html"}
{"_id":"How a Mexican snack became an American staple","articleText":"CNN is serving up some of our best food pieces. This article, originally published in 2014, details the history of the tortilla chip. Enjoy! (CNN)As a non-sports aficionado, my attraction to game day festivities has been solely food focused. So naturally, I noticed how potato chips have taken less and less space on the snack table to make room for tortilla chips and guacamole.Although potato chips continue to be the top-selling salted snack in terms of pounds sold, tortilla chips have been increasing in sales at a faster pace than potato chips, especially during this time of year, according to Tom Dempsey, CEO of the Snack Food Association.And, it's not just tortilla chips selling at such high rates either.Make homemade tortilla chipsTortillas -- not the chips but the round flat breads used to wrap burritos - have been outselling hamburger and hot dog buns at supermarkets and retail food stores since 2010.And salsa has been the new ketchup since 2008, according Jim Kabbani, CEO of the Tortilla Industry Association.One of the factors that contributes to that growth is immigration. As the Latino population grows, so will the variety of foods that cater to them. Especially since the Mexican-American population makes up the largest Hispanic group in the United States.Another factor that plays into the growth is that non-Hispanics have become more adventurous eaters, and companies want to cater to that, Kabbani said.While Mexican food in the United States has become ubiquitously American as apple pie, the backstory of how the crispy golden corn chip became the go-to snack chip hasn't really been told.In an effort to tell that story, nationally syndicated columnist of ¡Ask a Mexican! Gustavo Arellano wrote the book \"Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America.\"In the early 1900s, tortilla chips were already being manufactured and distributed to local restaurants in southern California but were never really a big deal.  In fact, their creation was even an afterthought.These tostadas, as they are called in Mexico, were made from leftover tortilla dough. Go figure.It wasn't long before Frito-Lay executives noticed how everyone in those southern California restaurants was gobbling up tostadas, so they decided to make the chips, too.  They called their product \"Doritos,\" Spanish for \"little golden things.\"Although few consider Doritos a tortilla chip, under all that cheesy seasoning is an oppressed golden tortilla chip - the first to be launched nationally in the United States.Shortly thereafter, tortilla chips made by other companies started to gain popularity - mostly driven by the rise of salsa, refried beans, and guacamole. But when nachos made their debut, it took tortillas chips to the next level.Side note: Nachos were a delicious accident. When two American customers walked into his restaurant in Mexico, head waiter Ignacio \"Nacho\" Ayala couldn't find the chef so he threw together some random ingredients and called them \"Nacho's Special,\" Arellano said.And the rest is history.Today, every NFL stadium and Major League Baseball offers nachos.  They're the third-largest concession seller overall, after popcorn and soda, outselling even hot dogs, Arellano notes.The rapid rise of nachos and guacamole persuaded Frito-Lay to make their own light, airy, slightly unseasoned tortilla chips.  The American company named them \"Tostitos\" and marketed them as \"authentic.\"Frito-Lay then hired Mexican-born, U.S.- raised actor Fernando Escandon - who had a slight Spanish accent - to do a series of commercials and it worked. It didn't hurt that Escandon also owned two Mexican restaurants either.\"Tostitos remains the biggest brand ... and it all started in the mid-1970s as a way to offer a more authentic alternative than Doritos,\" Arellano told CNN. \"Through clever marketing, they took over the tortilla chip business.\"Doritos still continue to be the best-selling tortilla chips and Tostitos and Tostitos Scoops follow - all under the Frito-Lay empire.Who invented the tortilla chip?The origin of the tortilla chip gets a bit complicated because like every tale in history, there are two sides to every story.While many have credited Rebecca Webb Carranza as the inventor and innovator of the tortilla chip, the Tamalina Milling Company claims its family's tortilla company made the famous corn chips long before that, Arellano wrote in Taco USA.Jose Bartolome Martinez, owner of the Tamalina Milling Company, claims he was the first to produce masolina to make tortillas, where you would only have to add water and masa emerged. All that production meant excess masa so Martinez decided to make tortilla chips as to not be wasteful.The Martinez family only recently donated materials to trademark the Tamalina brand of tortilla chip. While the tortilla chip's history is still a bit blurry, Frito-Lay's heavy marketing and branding has been so influential that many people refer to tortilla chips as \"Tostitos,\" even if they aren't buying the Frito-Lay brand.Potato chips keep things interestingNot only does Frito-Lay have the corner on the tortilla chip market, but it owns the leading potato chip brands: Fritos, Baked!, Ruffles and, their most popular brand, Lay's.And they aren't taking the rise of the tortilla chip lightly.\"Potato chip companies have become creative in their advertising, even going as far as changing the shape of their chips to triangles or mixing ingredients to make a hybrid chip,\" Kabbani said.In 2014, consumers could even name their flavor as part of Lay's \"Do Us a Flavor\" contest, which got a lot of bizarre entries.Kettle Brand is one of the few companies that isn't owned by Frito-Lay, and even though potato chip sales fell below tortilla chips recently, the company has focused its energy on two vital chip components: structure and flavor.\"The thick-cut and crunch of our chips also means they stand up really well against popular dips that have a tendency to make other chips crumble,\" Kettle Brand's brand manager Marc McCullagh told CNN.Kettle Brand has also built up a reputation for bold flavors - Maple Bacon, Sweet & Salty, Sriracha and Sweet Chili Garlic - and McCullagh said they'll keep doing that to keep up with the competition.While they're known for their kettle-style potato chips, Kettle Brand also sells tortilla chips, which they market as the \"healthier alternative.\"\"Unlike other plain tortilla chips brands, we focus on all-natural, organic and carry non-GMO ingredients,\" McCullagh said.After all, who wouldn't want to get a piece of the tortilla chip's multibillion-dollar industry that is exponentially expanding year after year?To each their own, I say.Granted, I'm not complaining. I love tortillas chips and potato chips, in every shape, size and flavor. But I'm keeping an eye on the snack table in case these tostadas make a full-blown culinary takeover during game day.This post originally ran in January 2014","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/living/feat-tortilla-chip-history-tailgating-eatocracy/index.html"}

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)If you think your tween or teen spends too many hours online, you might need to look in the mirror before you dish out screen time criticisms. According to a new survey, parents spend as much time plugged in each day as their teens and three hours more per day than their tweens.The survey, sponsored by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that helps parents, educators and children negotiate media and technology, found that parents of tweens and teens spend more than nine hours a day on average on screens. More than 80% of that time was for pleasure, not work, with parents watching television, playing video games, social networking, browsing websites, or doing other things on a computer, smartphone or tablet.Last year, in a survey of 8- to 18-year-olds, Common Sense Media found that teens spend the same amount of time -- about nine hours each day on average -- on devices or other screens. Tweens, identified as children 8 to 12, spend about six hours on average consuming media, the report found.\"I think it tells you that (parents) are not that different than their kids,\" said Michael Robb, director of research for Common Sense Media.And yet, 78% of parents felt that they were good role models for their children when it comes to media and technology, according to the national survey of nearly 1,800 parents of children ages 8 to 18. This is the first survey by Common Sense Media to focus on parents' screen use and attitudes.\"So there's a tension there,\" said Robb, noting how parents who think they are good role models worry about their children's screen use, but still spend plenty of time on screens themselves.\"It's going to be, I think, a challenge, and has been a challenge, for parents to find what the right balance is for them and for their children,\" he added.Micky Marie Morrison, a mom of two boys, ages 10 and 14, in Islamorada, Florida, said she thinks about her kids when she herself struggles with how addictive social media can be.\"I see it in myself. I have to open and close Facebook two or three times a day and not leave it open because it's just such a waste of time,\" said Morrison, the founder of BabyWeight TV, who says she spends about five hours a day on screens, with 70% of the time devoted to work.\"It can be hours a day just gone ... and I can see that happening to my kids as well, so I want to model when I'm with them that I'm not ignoring them to look at Facebook on my phone. I'm actually with them.\"Media multitasking? No problem, parents say When it comes to media multitasking -- using more than one screen at a time, such as watching TV while writing a proposal for work on your laptop -- about two-thirds of parents said it had no impact on the quality of their work.In last year's survey of tweens and teens, among the kids who said they multitask, about the same number -- nearly two-thirds -- said that texting or watching TV while doing homework didn't affect the quality of their work.\"If you're a parent and you're in front of your TV and you're trying to talk to your kid but you're also having to text on your phone and then you get frustrated when you're trying to get your kids' attention but they're texting, it's hard. It basically makes your job a lot harder,\" said Common Sense Media's Robb.Morrison, the mom of two who's also author of \"Baby Weight: The Complete Guide to Prenatal and Postpartum Fitness,\" said no one walks around her family home with their phone. All phones are stored in a cubby in the kitchen, in part, to protect against trying to media multitask. Her 14-year-old son is also only allowed one hour of smartphone time after school because he was just \"obsessing over it\" and constantly looking at Instagram and texting with his friends.\"It's so distracting,\" she said. \"He couldn't even get homework done or anything.\"'We're in this brand new no-man's land'In a somewhat surprising finding, the biggest fear parents have of social media is not that it distracts children from homework or could increase chances of bullying but that it negatively impacts physical activity -- too much time on Snapchat or Instagram means less time for exercise.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/parents-screen-use-attitudes-tweens-teens/index.html"}

{"_id":"How the sugar industry sweetened research in its favor","articleText":" (CNN)Scientists began to uncover a link between sugar and heart disease about 60 years ago, and now, the general consensus among experts is that sugar intake is associated with heart disease risk.But why did it take so long for researchers to inspect this link? A new historical analysis published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday claims that the sugar industry sponsored research that cast doubt about sugar's health risks and promoted fat \"as the dietary culprit\" in heart disease -- and didn't disclose it.A group then called the Sugar Research Foundation funded some of the early research on fat as the primary risk factor for heart disease, a \"sophisticated\" tactic to overshadow other research that placed blame on sweets as a risk factor, according to researchers.The foundation, now called the Sugar Association, questioned the new paper's findings in a response to CNN, saying it's \"challenging for us to comment on events that allegedly occurred 60 years ago, and on documents we have never seen.\" The organization was founded in 1943 by members of the American sugar industry and was dedicated to the scientific study of sugar's role in food, as well as communicating that role to the public. Researchers said the early heart disease research has implications for Americans' health today.\"If we could rewind the script back to 1965 and we had said, 'You know what, we're not just going to worry about fat and heart disease, we're also going to look at carbohydrates and in particular sugar, because that's a concentrated form of carbohydrate,' things might be really different,\" said Laura Schmidt, a professor of health policy in the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine and a co-author of the new analysis. \"If we had not dismissed the idea that carbohydrates played a significant role in heart disease, we would be potentially in a different place today in terms of our obesity and heart disease rates.\"The dawn of heart disease researchIn 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower, the 34th leader of the free world, suffered a massive heart attack. America watched the president's recovery intently, and exercise paired with a healthy diet became a new mantra to ward off heart disease. The following year, Eisenhower was elected to a second term, and America's focus on heart health -- and, specifically, what constituted a heart-healthy diet -- burgeoned.But by the 1960s, two opposing ideas about what caused heart disease emerged. John Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist, suggested that sugar consumption was linked to incidence of and mortality rates from coronary heart disease: Specifically, eating too much sugar might boost levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in blood.Meanwhile, Ancel Keys, an American physiologist, argued that heart disease was related to scarfing down too many bad types of fat, as such fats may raise cholesterol and possibly cause a heart attack.Keys' theory became more widely accepted than Yudkin's. Keys even graced a 1961 cover of Time magazine and was one of the first scientists to champion the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.Whatever happened to Yudkin's theory? Researchers suggest that when the sugar industry \"manipulated\" the scientific debate on heart disease, his theory -- along with other sugar consumption research -- was swept under the rug.Old letters reveal new secretsThe new paper was led by Cristin Kearns, a postdoctoral researcher at the UCSF School of Dentistry, who collected letters dating from 1959 to 1971 between executives at the Sugar Research Foundation and various scientists.Some of the letters, about 319, were in correspondence with Roger Adams, an organic chemist at the University of Illinois who died in 1971, and about 27 documents were in correspondence with David Mark Hegsted, a nutritionist at Harvard University who died in 2009.In one instance, according to the new analysis, foundation Vice President John Hickson received drafts of a review by Hegsted and replied, \"Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print.\"\"It isn't unusual for faculty who die, for their documents and materials to be stored or given as a gift to the university where they worked,\" Schmidt said. \"It just so happened that Roger Adams had a long history of working with the sugar organization, and his materials happened to contain documents by industry executives and are one window into how the industry manipulated science.\"Kearns, Schmidt and their colleague Stan Glantz, a professor of medicine at UCSF, analyzed the letters and other heart disease research-related public documents -- from symposium proceedings to annual reports -- from the 1950s and 60s.The researchers discovered that executives in the sugar industry funded research in the 1960s and '70s that, upon the executives' request, cast doubt on the health risks of sugar while promoting the risks of fat. As fat was slowly reduced in the American diet, sugar was used more often to keep foods tasty, Glantz said.\"The sugar interest groups, with sophistication, were staying on top of the science that was being developed and intervening in a very sophisticated way to try to push the discussion away from things that would hurt them and toward things that would help them,\" said Glantz, who has a long history of studying the tobacco industry. This new research on the sugar industry was sort of déjà vu, he said.\"It's all the same tricks. ... There was a pretty clear case emerging that eating sugar increased triglycerides, which increased heart disease risk. I think if the science had been left to its own devices, within a few years, there would have been a consensus that there was a causal link, which then should have influenced regulatory policy.\" Sugar warnings, then and nowIn 1980, the United States issued its first dietary guidelines for the nation, recommending that Americans avoid too much fat, saturated fat and cholesterol for better heart health. The guidelines also mentioned to avoid consuming too much sugar -- but not for the heart, rather because \"the major health hazard from eating too much sugar is tooth decay\" (PDF).\"Experts are still debating what the role of sugar and heart disease is, even though there was evidence going back to the '50s and '60s that a segment of the population with high triglyceride levels should potentially be concerned about their sugar consumption,\" Kearns said. \"Had we come to this conclusion much earlier, people who had this triglyceride level would have been counseled much differently.\"Now, it turns out that added sugars might be more of a risk factor for coronary heart disease than saturated fats, according to a 2015 paper published in the journal Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases. The paper suggests that a diet high in added sugars can cause a three-fold increase in the risk of death due to heart disease.In the latest dietary guidelines issued by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the government put a limit on sugar for the first time, recommending that added sugar make up only 10% of your daily calories. New recommendations from the American Heart Association say children 2 to 18 should consume no more than about 6 teaspoons of added sugars in their daily diets.The sugar industry weighs inA representative for the Sugar Association emailed a statement from the association to CNN, questioning the new paper's findings about the history of heart disease research and the sugar industry.\"We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today. Beyond this, it is challenging for us to comment on events that allegedly occurred 60 years ago, and on documents we have never seen,\" the statement said.The New England Journal of Medicine, where the first sugar industry-sponsored paper was published, didn't implement a conflict-of-interest policy to disclose research funding sources until 1984. JAMA followed suit a few years later.\"Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted. What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues,\" the Sugar Association statement said. \"Most concerning is the growing use of headline-baiting articles to trump quality scientific research -- we're disappointed to see a journal of JAMA's stature being drawn into this trend.\"The deadly legacy of heart diseaseAs the debate around risk factors for heart disease continues, it remains the leading cause of death in the United States. About 610,000 people die of heart disease nationwide each year, about one in every four deaths.Additionally, rates of obesity -- which puts people at a higher risk of heart disease -- have skyrocketed among both children and adults since the 1970s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the CDC. As for Americans 20 and older, 30.4% reported that they were obese last year, up from 29.9% in 2014.\"We're fatter than we've ever been, and we have diseases, epidemics of chronic diseases, related to sugar consumption,\" Schmidt said. Meanwhile, the prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled in just over three decades. \"A third of the population is walking around with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The main risk factors for that are heavy sugar consumption, trans fat consumption and obesity. It's soon to be the leading cause of liver transplantation in America,\" she said, adding that even though sugary beverage intake among Americans has increased over the past couple of decades, it now seems to be on the decline.\"Particularly, sugary drinks have gone down a lot, which is really promising.\"Schmidt, Kearns and Glantz have done the science community \"a great public service\" by resurfacing the history of funded heart disease research, said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, in an editorial accompanying the new paper in JAMA Internal Medicine.\"As George Santayana famously said in 'Reason of Common Sense' (1905), 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,' \" she wrote.Just last year, Coca-Cola was exposed funding health research to claim that exercise can mitigate the effects of excessive consumption of its products, according to a written statement from Dr. Jim Krieger, founding executive director of the nonprofit Healthy Food America. Krieger was not involved in the current study.\"We have to ask ourselves how many lives and dollars could have been saved, and how different today's health picture would be, if the industry were not manipulating science in this way,\" he said in the statement. \"Only 50 years later are we waking up to the true harm from sugar.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/health/sugar-industry-heart-disease-research/index.html"}

{"_id":"How to buy and eat caviar, according to a pro","articleText":" (CNN)\"They look like diamonds,\" says Alexandre Petrossian as he holds a tin of caviar under the light. The fish eggs sparkle inside his namesake restaurant in the historic Alwyn Court Building on 58th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, one block from Central Park. Petrossian -- the third generation to work in the luxury business founded by his grandfather in Paris almost 100 years ago -- is here to guide the uninitiated through the fascinating process of selecting and eating the finest caviar. Though the delicacy of Russian royalty still ranks among the most expensive foods in the world, costing up to hundreds of dollars for a tiny bite, Petrossian is anything but pretentious. Instead, he's unabashedly passionate when sharing his love of sturgeon roe and introducing others to it. \"It's often the case that people are afraid of trying caviar for the first time,\" he says. \"They don't want to invest their life savings. But there are ways you can enjoy caviar without breaking the bank.\" Work your way upPetrossian advises novices to \"come with a learning attitude\" and \"to educate\" their palates, which he compares to the journey of becoming a wine connoisseur. \"Don't buy too high a grade at first, it's not necessary,\" he says. \"Start with the lower grade and work your way up.\" Top grade caviar is usually more mature and lighter in color. He suggests first-time buyers try tranmontanus caviar from California, which costs about $50 for one serving. Though Caspian Sea beluga is a name usually associated with caviar, overfishing endangered wild sturgeon so importing it became illegal in 2005.Luckily, farm-raised tranmontanus is somewhat affordable, \"easy to enjoy and you'll have the total experience of delicious caviar,\" says Petrossian. After trying this \"Mercedes of caviar,\" you can proceed to \"the Rolls-Royce and the Maybach.\"Don't buy it till you've tried it\"Try the caviar you're going to buy, that is key,\" as taste can vary from tin to tin, he says.  And a buyer should always be wary, Petrossian cautions, as sometimes caviar is a \"fishy business -- I mean that without being funny.\" A few shady distributors purposely mislabel tins, akin to putting a Chanel tag on a knock-off purse. Petrossian suggests always examining the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) number that's on better tins. This international organization, which regulates wild game, names the actual fish the caviar came from.Keep it cold Once you purchase your caviar, there's about a six-week window to enjoy it. Petrossian stresses that temperature is key. \"Put it in the deepest and coldest part of your fridge, usually where you store vegetables,\" he says. \"Open the tin at the last minute and then put it on crushed ice.\" Hold the silver, but not the vodka Now the tricky part, how exactly do you eat caviar? First, you'll want to \"feel comfortable around these little fish eggs,\" says Petrossian. So relax, this is a treat to savor. Second, you need a spoon made out of a neutral material like wood or bone as silver reacts with the fish eggs. Put about a half teaspoon in your mouth and \"crush the little eggs with your tongue on your palate. Just mix the oil,\" says Petrossian. For the purest experience, he likes to eat caviar \"straight out of the tin\" -- you can add toast points and creme fraiche as your taste develops. Your first bite of caviar should dazzle, bursting in your mouth with a satisfyingly rich, perfectly salty, exotic flavor. To dry the palate before the next delicious taste, Petrossian recommends either traditional vodka or Champagne as \"the bubbles remove oils on the tongue.\" It's a matter of taste, not priceSitting in his restaurant, Petrossian tries \"one of the better caviars\"-- a Special Reserve Alverta that runs just over $200 per serving. He takes a bite and, even after a lifetime in the business, his eyes sparkle. \"My God, it's delicious,\" he says. \"The eggs are huge and firm. It's deep without being too strong. The flavor is robust. You feel it on your tongue for a long time.\" Despite his reaction, Petrossian says \"there is no actual best caviar.\" \"There is the most expensive because it's the rarest,\" he says. \"It can be the best to you. Or the best to you can be the cheapest. It's all a matter of taste. And all tastes are different.\"What matters is that when you do find your perfect tin of caviar, you are also buying the inevitable special memories that come with it, says Petrossian. \"Whoever you share caviar with makes the experience even better,\" he says.One of his favorite memories was when his son tried the delicacy for the first time -- at 18 months old. Petrossian says the toddler's first reaction was \"a little, 'what is that?'\" \"Then he just had his mouth open [as if to say] 'I want more. Give me more.'\" And that seems to be the prevailing trend with caviar -- after one bite, you're hooked for life.Margaret Heidenry is a writer and avid reader living in Brooklyn, NY.

{"_id":"How to cook a Thanksgiving turkey ","articleText":"America's Test Kitchen is a real 2,500-square-foot test kitchen near Boston that's home to more than three dozen full-time cooks and product testers. Our mission is simple: to develop the absolute best recipes for all your favorite foods. To do this, we test each as many as 70 times until we arrive at the combination of ingredients, technique, temperature, cooking time and equipment that yields the best, most-foolproof recipe.  (CNN)Thanksgiving comes but once a year, but the stakes couldn't be higher for making the pièce de résistance -- a perfectly bronzed and juicy turkey. Don't take chances by making guesses on how to prepare the bird. We'll show you exactly how to cook it for the best Thanksgiving ever.Make this year better than ever with the online Cook's Illustrated Thanksgiving Guide. We'll help you plan, shop and cook.Let's start with the meal's centerpiece. Here's our time-tested advice for serving the perfect turkey.How to buy turkeyMost of us purchase a whole turkey just a few times a year, but typically it's for a special occasion so its key to shop wisely.WholeModern commercial turkeys don't contain much fat, yet, as we all know, fat is what provides meat with juiciness and flavor. To make up for it, some birds are \"pre-basted\" (injected with a solution), but our tasters found that these birds can have a \"wet\" texture.Pasture-raised, organic turkeys promise a flavor improvement because of their diverse diet, but we didn't find that to be the case, plus the meat was slightly stringier and tougher (you will need to brine these birds if you buy them).Heritage turkeys are directly descended from wild turkeys, and they nearly disappeared in the mid-20th century as commercial Broad-Breasted Whites were bred by the poultry industry. We have certainly found favor with the heritage turkeys that we've tried over the years, but given the range of taster opinion about flavor, from \"outstanding\" to \"funky,\" we aren't sure the high price tag and effort it takes to track one down are worth it.We like turkeys that have been koshered (covered in kosher salt, then rinsed multiple times). Koshering works to season the meat, improve its texture, and help it retain moisture -- if you buy a kosher turkey there's no need to brine or salt it. However, kosher turkeys aren't always easy to find, so we typically call for \"all-natural\" turkeys. These turkeys have been fed a vegetarian diet and are free to roam. These turkeys tend to contain less fat, which translates to a drier bird, so we always recommend brining these turkeys.Suggested Cook's Illustrated recipe: Roast Salted TurkeyBone-in breastsMost supermarkets regularly offer two slightly different styles of whole bone-in turkey breast: regular (a.k.a. true cut) and hotel (a.k.a. country-style). regular-cut turkey breast includes the whole bone-in breast with ribs, a portion of the wing meat and a portion of the back and neck skin. The hotel-cut turkey breast is essentially the same cut, though it comes with its wings, neck and giblets, all important material if you intend to make a gravy or sauce to accompany the cooked meat. These tend to cost a little more and are almost always sold fresh, not frozen.Whichever style you find and purchase, try to avoid turkey breasts that have been injected with a saline solution (a brine of sorts) -- these are often called \"self-basters.\" We found the solution masks the natural flavor of the turkey. (If the only bird you can find is a self-baster, do not brine it, as the meat will already be quite salty.)Also, ignore the pop-up timer that comes with some turkey breasts; the meat will be long overcooked before the popper pops. If your turkey has a pop-up timer, leave it in and gauge doneness according to an instant-read thermometer. Don't remove the timer until the meat is done; otherwise it will leave a gaping hole from which juices will flow.Suggested Cook's Illustrated recipe: Easy Roast Turkey BreastFour principles of cooking a bird1. Brine or salt to increase juicinessIn the same way that you prepare to cook beef or pork, brining poultry in a saltwater solution boosts the flavor and juiciness of the meat. However, there's a drawback to brining skin-on poultry: Because it's soaking up liquid, achieving perfectly crisp skin is more difficult. In these cases, make sure to pat the skin as dry as possible prior to cooking. Alternatively, for some cuts you might opt to salt the poultry.2. Cook white meat less than dark meatDark meat (thighs and drumsticks) cooks more slowly than white breast meat. This is mainly a result of the fact that dark meat is denser because it has more fat and proteins. To account for this difference when cooking a whole bird we've found it best to shield the breast meat to protect it from the heat by starting the bird either breast side down or with the breast to the side, then finishing breast side up.White meat should be cooked only to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, while dark meat should be cooked to 175 degrees. Having a good instant-read thermometer is essential.3. Crisp the skin or lose the skinFor many of us, crisp skin on a piece of turkey is the best part. And on the flip side, flabby turkey skin isn't something anyone wants to eat (nor is it visually appealing). So either make sure the skin is crispy or remove it. The key to crisp skin is rendering all the fat that is between the skin and the meat. When roasting a whole bird, if you don't want to serve the skin you can still keep it on while roasting to protect the delicate breast meat from the heat, but discard it before serving.4. Let it restAs poultry cooks, the juices are driven toward the center of the cut, so a resting period after cooking is essential to allow those juices time to redistribute evenly throughout. Logically, the larger the piece of poultry, the longer the resting time required. A big turkey needs 30 minutes.Salting versus briningSalting poultry in advance is one way to season the meat and keep it juicy. When salt is applied to raw poultry, juices inside are drawn to the surface. The salt then dissolves in the exuded liquid, forming a brine that is eventually reabsorbed by the poultry. The salt changes the structure of the muscle proteins, allowing them to hold on to more of their own natural juices.Salting requires time, but it won't thwart the goal of crispy skin. We prefer to use kosher salt for salting because it's easier to distribute the salt evenly. We use Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt; if using Morton Kosher Salt, reduce the amount listed by 33 percent (e.g. use 2/3 teaspoon Morton Kosher Salt or 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal).For salting a whole turkey: Apply 1 teaspoon salt per pound evenly inside cavity and under skin of breasts and legs, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let rest in refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.Brining works in much the same way as salting. Salt in the brine seasons the poultry and promotes a change in its protein structure, reducing its overall toughness and creating gaps that fill up with water and keep the meat juicy and flavorful. Brining works faster than salting and can also result in juicier lean cuts since it adds, versus merely retains, moisture. But note that brining inhibits browning, and it requires fitting a brining container in fridge. We prefer to use table salt for brining since it dissolves quickly in the water.-- 1 whole turkey (12 to 17 pounds): Brine in 2 gallons cold water and 1 cup table salt for 6 to 12 hours-- 1 whole turkey (18 to 24 pounds): Brine in 3 gallons of cold water and 1 1/2 cups table salt for 6 to 12 hours-- 1 bone-in turkey breast (6 to 8 pounds): Brine in 1 gallon of cold water and 1/2 cup table salt for 3 to 6 hoursOur turkey-cooking wisdom is distilled from over 20 years' worth of recipe development; the information above is adapted from our newest book, The Cooking School Cookbook, a comprehensive reference for every home cook.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/how-to-cook-turkey-thanksgiving/index.html"}
{"_id":"How to handle holidays with a narcissist","articleText":"Your mother wants to tell you how wrong you are for, well, everything involving your kids. Or your aunt wants to pry into your love life -- and insult you about your single status. Maybe it's a friend who needs to one-up you about everything (you just went away for the weekend? She's planning on taking a luxurious tropical vacation. And flying first class). Or, your sister needs all the attention on her -- and throws a fit when she doesn't get it.While only 6% of the US population is thought to actually have narcissistic personality disorder, narcissism is really on a spectrum. \"I think all of us have people in our family that meet some of the criteria for being a narcissist,\" says Karyl McBride, PhD, licensed marriage and family therapist and author of \"Will I Ever Be Good Enough? Healing the Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers.\" (Learn the signs someone you know -- or even you! -- might be a narcissist.)When you're heading out to all the holiday parties and gatherings this year, you don't have to run away from your narcissistic mother, uncle, or family friend. Here's how to face them head on:Don't fight backAs hard as it can be, you shouldn't try to compete with a narcissist. \"Remember that they're usually driven by an unconscious sense of shame or inferiority,\" says Joseph Burgo, PhD, author of \"The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age.\" For that reason, if you fight back, you'll lose -- and may make an enemy, he says. You can't choose your family members, so it's best to listen politely, then excuse yourself and join another conversation. But a friend? \"You might want to look for different friends who take an interest in you, too,\" Burgo says. Now that's honesty. (Here are the two routes to a friend breakup.)Remember this one wordNarcissists have a way of surprising you with their meanness. \"They're not in touch with their own feelings, so if they're having a bad day, they'll project that onto other people,\" explains McBride. Whether they give you a backhanded compliment or deliver an outright insult, don't get sucked in. Instead, shrug your shoulders and say this one word: \"Interesting.\" That's McBride's favorite go-to response when something comes at you out of the blue and you need time to think without reacting. It shows them that, nope, you're not taking the bait and they can't get to you.11 Signs of Borderline Personality DisorderPlay the opposite roleThe holidays are about spending time with loved ones and getting all the fuzzies from doing so. Sadly, narcissists love to gossip and put people down behind their backs. \"It's their way of making themselves bigger and better than everyone else,\" says McBride. A good comeback when they tell you that they don't like so-and-so because oh, gosh do you see how she dresses/acts/looks: give the person she just panned a compliment. Say, \"Oh, I think she's super smart with the way she runs her business,\" or \"she's always been a really great friend to me.\" End scene.Stroke their egoNarcissists have a way of holding onto a grudge. (Remember, everything is about them -- and they remember being slighted even in the smallest ways for a long time.) \"My advice often strikes people as cowardly, but there is no value in standing up for yourself or trying to explain,\" says Burgo. The best option is to avoid them entirely if they're still mad at whatever happened at the holiday party two years ago, but if that's not possible, try to make them feel good about themselves, he says. What's going on with their job? What else do they have planned for the holidays?30 Signs You're in a Toxic RelationshipBut don't always give inOne time you should stand up for yourself is when your pesky relative wants to give you a bunch of unsolicited advice, whether about your job, love life, or diet. \"Most people feel like this takes their power away, so I don't think you should put up with it,\" says McBride. Still, set a boundary with \"kindness,\" she says. Say something like, \"I understand that that's what you'd do, but I have my own way of handling my own life.\" And, in the future, keep the convos superficial -- don't divulge info about yourself. Good topics: football, the weather, and the news.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/health/narcissist-holidays/index.html"}

{"_id":"How to prepare for the Day After ","articleText":"Juliette Kayyem is the author of the best-selling \"Security Mom: An Unclassified Guide to Protecting Our Homeland and Your Home.\" She is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, a former assistant secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration and founder of Kayyem Solutions, a security consulting firm. Kayyem was a Hillary Clinton supporter who advised the campaign on homeland security issues. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. (CNN)As President-elect Donald Trump's transition continues with an unprecedented level of confusion and delay, it is worth noting that this, in fact, is the easy part.  Transitions from one administration to another are so formalized and organized at this stage -- buoyed by a congressional statute that lays out the process and protocols -- that nothing but utter mismanagement can explain what is unfolding. Complaints about the transition, irrespective of controversial and unqualified personnel whose names are being floated, are not a partisan gripe. Transitions are generally taken seriously, because anything can happen on Day One. Trump won, and he must be prepared to immediately govern.But as the days have unfolded, I have been growing more concerned with what the management, backstabbing and infighting also reveal. This team of mostly white men -- with conservative and racially tinged inclinations, including from the recently announced national security adviser Michael Flynn -- may not be able to handle a crisis with a steady hand and commitment to unity. In short, if the lead-up to Day One is any hint, as a nation we must prepare for a disturbing Day After. Here's something we know for sure: This future president will face a crisis. It may be a major storm, an earthquake, an oil spill or a virus like Zika. Chances are also high, given the nature of the terror threat today, that some radicalized lone wolf will be able to succeed in killing Americans in the name of Islam. And when that happens, whether it is a large or small attack, the pressures on any administration to do something in response will be profound.  Trump ran on a campaign that embraced distrust, if not outright disassociation, with Muslims. Beyond his Muslim ban proposal, Trump is also likely to end the Syrian refugee program. At various times during the campaign, he or his advisers, Rudy Giuliani in particular, have applauded Muslim registries and mosque surveillance.  There was, not coincidentally, an increase in hate crimes against Muslims in America by 67% last year.So imagine an attack here in the United States in 2017. President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama used their leadership roles to temper the worst inclinations in angry Americans. Bush visited a mosque less than one week after 9/11, and Obama's responsible but controversial refusal to use the language \"Islamic terrorism\" signaled respect for a religion with 1 billion adherents. An entire national security and law enforcement apparatus has since embraced community outreach to Arabs and Muslims to minimize the threats and build a bridge for conversation. Under Trump, that may not hold. The government may increase use of detention centers, surveillance and intimidation tactics within Muslim and Arab communities. Of course, at this stage, we cannot know with certainty. But statements by Kansas secretary of state and Trump supporter Kris Kobach promoting Muslim registries and invoking internment camps provide some hint of the default plan, and without any condemnation by the transition team, that suggests a degree of approval. So, in anticipation, those outside of government must prepare. The burden to protect the rights of American communities is not one that the burdened community can manage alone.  In homeland security planning, I often tell people to stop worrying and start preparing. Mayors in diverse communities must begin to plan for outreach and unity in the wake of a federal government stoking fear. Major police departments should predesignate their Muslim officers to have key leadership roles in the wake of an attack (New York City has, for example, 900 Muslim police officers to choose from). The media, likely to cover the news of the attack and investigation itself, should prepare separate teams of reporters to uncover and investigate federal overreach. They should also avoid the inclination to only utilize imams as experts, as the Muslim community is diverse and integrated into the fabric of law, politics, sports and business as well.   Religious leaders from other denominations, who have tremendous influence in setting the tone of faith and healing, need to be prepared to speak up loudly and clearly. Major employers can set an important tone immediately by using their communications platforms, as well as establishing protocols for acceptable employee behavior. University presidents should do the same.  Trump is our future President, and he has both the bully pulpit and the federal government to lead during a crisis. We can continue to hope that he will follow in the tradition of the presidents before him. But, failing that, it is incumbent on those who care about our homeland security to prepare for what can happen to our nation the Day After.

{"_id":"How will recounts work in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania? ","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's destruction of the Democratic \"blue wall\" of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- victories that catapulted him to the presidency over Hillary Clinton -- is set to become the subject of recounts. The process, spurred by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, will play out differently in the three states, but is highly unlikely to end up changing the result: Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. Clinton, however, will likely win the popular vote by more than 2 million ballots.Wisconsin's recount is set to start this week, while Stein's campaign plans to request a recount in Michigan by Wednesday and is working to organize the hundreds of petitions needed to get one started in Pennsylvania.Here's what you need to know:How will the recounts work? In Wisconsin, first, each county is providing the state's election commission with estimates of the recount's cost. That amount will be due from the campaigns of either or both the Green Party's Stein and the Reform Party's Roque De La Fuente -- both of whom sought the recount -- by the end of the business day Tuesday.  Then, it'll be up to elections officials in each of the state's 72 counties to work nights and weekends to recount their votes. This will all happen at a rapid pace: Under Wisconsin law, the deadline to finalize the tally is December 13 -- placing extra urgency on the court battles over county-level procedures that pop up in every recount. State officials did not require each county to tally its results by hand -- so it is possible county vote canvassing boards that opt to re-tabulate machines' results could face lawsuits seeking a change in methodology. But they expressed confidence little would change. \"If nothing else, this is going to give us a very good audit, it's going to reassure Wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we're not counting illegal votes,\" said Elections Commission Chairman Mark Thomsen.In Michigan -- where votes are all cast by hand and machines aren't used -- the time frame would be even tighter.

{"_id":"Hundreds of VA dental patients possibly exposed to HIV, hepatitis","articleText":" (CNN)Nearly 600 patients who received dental care at a Wisconsin Veterans Affairs medical center may have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis B and C and now face an anxious wait to find out if they were infected.Earlier this week, officials said a dentist at the Tomah VA Medical Center improperly re-used his own dental equipment instead of using the sterilized, disposable tools as VA rules require. \"It was purposeful that he was violating VA regulations,\" said Victoria Brahm, acting medical director at the Tomah VA Center in a press briefing earlier this week. \"During all of the orientation, he used our equipment. He used it appropriately, so it was very purposeful from what we found in our investigation that he knew exactly what he was doing, and preferred to use his own equipment against procedure.\"A fill-in assistant recognized the breach in protocol and reported the issue, according to CNN affiliate WEAU. The dentist, who not been identified, is expected to appear in front of a review board Monday as he faces administrative proceedings, said Matthew Gowan, a spokesman for the Tomah VA.The dentist was hired at the facility in October 2015 and saw 592 patients there. His patients were notified this week that they may have been exposed.The VA is offering them free testing and follow-up care. The blood test results take about two to three weeks, WEAU reported.The dentist has since been moved to an administrative role and is not seeing patients.The most important part is the actual risk of infection is low here -- it is out of an abundance of caution that we are doing this,\" said Gowan.A team at the medical center looked at records of known HIV, hepatitis B and C cases, what kind of work was done by the dentist and the risk of transmission.U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, questioned why the dentist has not been fired.\"This news is not just heartbreaking; it's outrageous,\" he said in a statement. \"How can our veterans be treated so carelessly and where is the accountability?\"\"The individual in question has not even been fired -- a truly stunning show of bureaucratic impunity. This demonstrates once and for all that the VA needs a complete overhaul, so that our veterans finally get the care -- and the respect -- they deserve.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/health/va-dentist-exposure/index.html"}

{"_id":"In biblical lands of Iraq, Christianity in peril after ISIS","articleText":"Bartella, Iraq (CNN)Behnam Lalo crunches over jagged glass and tiptoes around a fallen altar, burned Bibles and a decapitated porcelain Virgin Mary. He picks up a cross from a heap of rubble and wipes away ashes with his priest's robes. He recognizes the cross immediately; he used it at confirmation ceremonies of so many boys and girls here at St. George Church. He no longer knows where some of them are. Or, if they are still alive. This was a sanctuary once, a place of peace and love in the northern Iraqi town of Bartella, just 13 miles east of Mosul. Now everything is in disarray -- defaced and damaged, covered in soot and remnants of war. In the adjoining cemetery, a rocket launcher points east toward the front lines, and bullet-ridden gravestones stand as silent witnesses to the desecration.A crushing sadness descends on Lalo. He tightens his grip on the small cross as his face fills with resolve. He will build again with new bricks and mortar, replace pillaged pews and find a chandelier more beautiful than the one he had installed a few years ago. With few resources, rebuilding is sure to be a challenge. But Lalo knows that's the easy part. How will he be able to restore faith in this fractured land? The Bible tells followers not to judge others. \"Forgive, and you will be forgiven,\" it says. Those words, Lalo believes, are at the very core of Christianity.But after everything that has happened in Iraq, Lalo sees hatred in the hearts of the people. It will be almost impossible to forgive the militant men of the self-proclaimed Islamic State who shattered thousands of lives. Or live again in these ancient lands where Christianity came early but is now edging dangerously close to extinction.Mosul was once a diverse and tolerant city'Life can never be the same'On October 17, Iraq launched a major military campaign to defeat ISIS in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh province. Lalo followed each battle closely, as did all the others in Ankawa, a Christian enclave in Irbil where Lalo and thousands of other displaced people have been living since 2014.The following evening, as Iraqi forces fought militants in the Christian towns of the Nineveh Plains, impromptu celebrations erupted on the streets of Ankawa. Lalo felt hope rising in his heart. Perhaps he would be able to go home soon.A few days later, on his 49th birthday, news of Bartella's liberation reached Lalo. The violent booms of war went quiet, and for the first time in more than two years, church bells pealed, the sounds echoing like a dirge through the ravaged and empty town.It was the greatest gift in Lalo's lifetime, but bittersweet.Life in Bartella, as he knew it, stopped suddenly and brutally in the summer of 2014. ISIS blitzkrieged its way into northern Iraq, taking control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest and once its most diverse city.ISIS marked Christian houses with the Arabic equivalent of the letter \"N\" for the derogatory term Nazarene. The militants blared ultimatums from the loudspeakers of Mosul mosques: Leave by July 19 to avoid death or forced conversion to Islam. The terror-driven exodus emptied the city of Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities. A decade ago, 35,000 Christians lived in Mosul. Now maybe 20 or 30 remain.Three weeks later, ISIS repeated its scourge in the towns and villages in surrounding Nineveh province, the historical homeland of Iraqi Christians. Many had sought refuge here from persecution in other parts of the country, especially after the 2003 US-led invasion gave rise to sectarian strife.Lalo was not at home when ISIS fighters overran Bartella on August 8, 2014. He'd gone to Baghdad on church business and was in the Kurdish capital of Irbil on his way home when he began to hear about families fleeing Bartella and other Christian towns such as Qaraqosh, Baghdida and Tal Kayf. The people who escaped ISIS told Lalo they had no money or possessions, that they had walked for days through harsh desert terrain to reach the Kurdish border. They recounted stories of forced conversions, captivity, beatings, rape and murder. They'd left everything at home to run for their lives and were willing to risk settling in unknown lands to save themselves.By some estimates, 100,000 Christians fled Nineveh and streamed into the relatively safe semiautonomous Kurdish region. They found refuge in empty houses and unfinished buildings in Irbil and Dohuk. Soon, humanitarian organizations and churches set up camps for the displaced. In the biblical lands of Nineveh, Christians -- by virtue of their beliefs -- found themselves living as refugees. In Ankawa, as many as 6,000 of them live in converted shipping containers that make up Ashti camp. They cherish the little they have left in life. Some have wallpapered their small abodes. Others have decorated with posters of flowers. Almost all have put up crosses on their roofs or the outer walls, as if to signal their distress to the world. And their resolve in their faith.One of them is 26-year-old Maha Sabah. ISIS entered Bartella on her wedding night, turning celebration into horror. At least, she says, she was able to wear her wedding dress. At least she now has a roof to shelter her from the weather.\"So many girls in Bartella will never be able to have a wedding,\" she says. \"How can they? Life can never be the same anymore.\"Nearby, Taqla Giggi sits on a folding chair and holds her head in her hands. She is 77 and survived years of conflict in Iraq but now cannot stop crying. \"It is all gone,\" she says. \"We are finished. No one wants us.\"Month after month, Lalo ministered to the displaced as they struggled to survive. Like Lalo, they were consumed with news about their besieged homes. ISIS severed territory it held from the outside world, but word got out about the militant group's brutality and its nihilistic campaign to destroy historic sites and monuments. One was the monastery of St. Elijah outside Mosul, which stood for 1,400 years and was the oldest Christian monastery in Iraq. It quickly became clear to Lalo that ISIS intended to eradicate Iraq's indigenous Christian community and all evidence of its 2,000-year civilization. He heard the word \"genocide\" being used to describe his people just as it had been for the Yazidis. At one time, nearly 5 million Assyrian Christians lived in Iraq as a healthy minority, but their numbers have dwindled through the decades. They fled to faraway places such as the United States, Europe and Australia, and many more who have been displaced by ISIS are hoping to do the same.Before ISIS, roughly 300,000 Christians remained in Iraq. But no one knows how many survived or how many will return home to restart their lives. Many of them, understandably, have lost hope. They say Christianity is dead in Iraq. And the way of life they knew for generations has vanished.Lalo lived with these fears gripping his heart. And when ISIS was finally driven out of Bartella on a late October day, he grew exceedingly anxious to return.Maybe things could never be the same again, he thought. But why should Christians be driven from their ancestral lands? He told himself he would try everything in his power to bring back Bartella. The Iraqi women who escaped ISIS but lost everythingComing homeWhen he thought it was safe, Lalo returned to Bartella on a reconnaissance mission. The depth of the destruction he found was devastating. Almost a week after the town's liberation, I join Lalo on his second trip back home.We drive down the main highway that connects the Kurdish region to troubled Nineveh and the front lines of the war to free Mosul, the last ISIS stronghold in Iraq. Lalo stares out the window as we pass oil companies and strip malls on the outskirts of Irbil; everything from gaudy bridal gowns to lamb shawarma is for sale. Then the landscape turns lunar, and ahead, we see the jarringly vivid turquoise of the Khazir River. ISIS bombed the main road crossing, and cars now have to take a temporary, single-lane Versa Bridge.As a boy, Lalo jumped with his brothers from the bridge to frolic in the water and escape the supernatural heat of Iraqi summers. How sad, he says, that children can no longer partake in such innocent amusement, not after the blackness of ISIS descended on these ancient lands, smothering them like a blanket does a fire.Evidence of the violence lies to the left of the road in Khazir: Endless rows of tents in the desert house families fleeing the madness. It was hard for Lalo to imagine the lives of children wrecked in this way. He'd grown up in a big family, surrounded by joy.When he was young, Bartella was almost all Christian, he tells me. There were few Muslim families there, and the townspeople conversed not in Arabic but in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language scholars believe was spoken by Jesus. Saddam Hussein's \"Arabization\" policy changed Bartella, but the town remained predominantly Christian -- about a third were Catholics and the rest Syrian Orthodox.Lalo grew up one of nine siblings. His father was an army surgeon, and Lalo describes his childhood as simple but comfortable. They enjoyed small luxuries like owning a car.The family lived not far from St. George Church, built in 1939, and Lalo often wandered among the olive trees and thistle in the garden. He played soccer with his friends on the neatly laid out streets of Bartella until the sun went down and it was too dark to see. Christian women survived ISIS by hiding for hours under dorm bedsThese days, innocence is gone. Everyone is suspicious. No one knows if teenagers kicking around a soccer ball one minute will blow themselves up the next.During the years of punishing international sanctions on Hussein's Iraq after the Gulf War, Lalo left home in search of employment in Jordan. He tried many things but eventually returned to the place he cherished in his youth: the church. He studied for the priesthood in Beirut and was ordained in 2010.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 He wanted very much to shepherd souls devoted to Christ in the lands of ancient Assyria. This was where Jonah came with his message of repentance and St. Thomas on his way to India. Christianity took root here, perhaps as early as the first century. Today, Lalo and I share the road with petroleum tankers and the Iraqi army's American-made Humvees painted a menacing black with the word \"Mosul\" stenciled on the front. We are passing through areas that just a few days before were under the control of ISIS. We see tires planted in the middle of the road and tin barrels filled with tar off to the sides. ISIS used them to set everything afire.We pass an Iraqi armored vehicle waving a flag with an image of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed and one of the holiest figures for Shia Muslims. Lalo recoils in his seat. The Shia flag, he believes, is an ominous sign of things to come if and when ISIS is driven out of Mosul.\"This flag shouldn't be here. It's provocation,\" he tells me. \"We should see only the Iraqi flag.\"Muslims have invaded this part of Iraq for centuries, and Christian blood has been spilled before. But Lalo views the Shiite-dominated Baghdad government as looking out for its own interests and has little confidence that it can build a post-ISIS Iraq in harmony.Sectarian violence gripped Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and even though Iraqis seem united in the offensive to oust ISIS from Mosul, Lalo isn't sure minorities will receive fair and equal treatment in the aftermath. Who will guarantee Christian representation in local government? Who will make sure the persecution and killings stop? Lalo believes the international community must step in to protect Bartella and all of the Nineveh Plains. Otherwise, there will be no peace. Not for a long time.We drive through a patch of lonely highway. There is little green here, only an abyss of sand crisscrossed by helter-skelter power lines. Lalo points out a clothing factory opened by a Mosul businessman just months before ISIS took hold. It employed hundreds of people from Bartella, but now it's a massive hollow structure of mangled steel and charred innards. It will take great effort to restart the economy here. Without jobs, businesses and schools, no one will go back to their homes. I watch Lalo gaze out over the landscape and wonder what it must feel like to return to a hometown that is destroyed.'We built all this and Daesh destroyed it'From the direction of Irbil, Bartella sits to the right of the highway. Just past the clothing factory, we make a sharp turn. The town had put up new street lights not long ago and amazingly, most are still standing, their midcentury-style white posts stretching out like angels' wings high above the destruction.Bartella after ISIS is shocking to see. Almost every house is damaged, some left as massive slabs of pancaked concrete and beyond repair.Many, including Lalo's brother's house, bear black signs that say: \"Property of the Islamic State\" or the ISIS slogan: \"Enduring and Expanding.\" Others say, \"Mufakakh,\" or \"booby-trapped.\" ISIS fighters are known for laying suitcase bombs, mines and other deadly explosive devices in residences, schools, hospitals and other areas used by the civilian population.Every street is strewn with litter and spent shells, the gardens and crops singed black. Swarms of flies hover over rotting garbage.\"This is my town,\" Lalo tells me. \"They looted all the houses, took everything -- TVs, washing machines, furniture. They took our money, our gold. These are our crosses to bear.\"We built all this and Daesh destroyed it,\" he says, using the Arabic term for ISIS. \"They want to take us back 500 years. Why didn't they bring us camels?\"Amid the trash are things that remind Lalo of the life he knew before. Photographs of weddings, baptisms and family gatherings. A broken set of bone china, one cup still sitting on a shelf. A Spiderman spiral notebook that perhaps belonged to a child. A woman's leopard-print high-heel shoe. He shows me the house where he lived with his elderly mother. It looks like a tornado mowed through it. He gives me a tour as though I were a potential buyer and everything was still perfectly intact. \"This is my room,\" he says. \"This is the kitchen. This is another bedroom where my mother slept.\" He runs down a flight of stairs into the cellar and pops back up with a dusty bottle. Remarkably, it is unbroken. It is the wine Lalo made in 2010, he tells me with enormous pride. We discuss how just days before, the Iraqi parliament passed a law forbidding the import, production or selling of alcoholic beverages. The move was seen by many Christians as a portent of things to come in an increasingly intolerant Islamic Iraq.At St. George Church, Lalo steps out of the car and faces his beloved house of worship. Inside the plundered and scorched sanctuary, he bows his head and begins singing a mezmur, an Aramaic hymn. I see tears collecting in his eyes as his voice travels through the church carcass and out into the cloudless day. \"Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens!\"For a moment, Lalo feels the Bartella of his past. Then it is gone, interrupted by the boom of a massive explosion down the road. Out there, war is still raging.'Do not let them destroy our faith'The next day, a Sunday, Lalo prepares to lead Mass back in Irbil.In this church, there are no stained glass windows, chandeliers or carved wooden pews. Just plastic chairs lined up under harsh energy-saving lights, a cheap poster of Jesus and an altar decorated with plastic flowers and Christmas lights.Lalo helped set up the makeshift church in a newly built gated community where houses stood empty after the Kurdish economy went south. The church stepped in, rented the houses for a nominal sum and organized shelter for the victims of ISIS. At one time, 230 families occupied 42 houses. They felt cramped in the shared space, but they knew they were the lucky ones. At least they weren't among the thousands living in the nearby Ashti camp. Lalo dons a white alb and a made-in-India amice embellished with gold and black embroidery. The small room quickly fills with the heady smell of incense and with people weary from war.Lalo's message on this evening is not easy to digest. An elderly man wearing a traditional white dishdasha bristles. A young mother puts her arm around her daughter, drawing her close.\"When Jesus was on the cross, he asked God to forgive those who put him there. He said, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.' I know it is difficult, but what kind of Christians are we if we cannot forgive?\"The somber sound of a collective \"Amen\" fills the evening air.Lalo speaks to his congregation of how Christians have survived persecution before and how they will survive again through this grave chapter known as ISIS. \"Yes, they destroyed everything,\" he says, \"but do not let them destroy our faith.\" He casts aside even his own doubts about the future. If Christians abandon their homelands, there will be nothing left. An entire way of life will be lost, he says, imploring his people to find hope. \"We will build everything again. Jesus is our salvation.\"Yes, Bartella was liberated. But it wasn't yet free. ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/middleeast/iraq-christianity-peril/index.html"}

{"_id":"India Supreme Court orders all movie theaters to play national anthem","articleText":" (CNN)Movie theaters across India must play the national anthem before every film, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The anthem -- \"Jana Gana Mana\" -- will be accompanied by an image of the Indian flag. \"All present in the (cinema) hall are obliged to stand up to show respect to the national anthem,\" Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy wrote.  The ruling is in response to a petition filed by Narayan Chouksey, a retired engineer in Bhopal, who asked the court to \"specify what would be constituting disrespect and abuse of the national anthem.\" Attorneys for Chouksey argued that the anthem was being regularly insulted and called on the court to lay down norms to protect it.The court said the ruling must be implemented within 10 days. Law of the land While the national anthem is already played before movies by some theaters, and many Indians grew up listening to the song before most school and society events, it has never before been the law except in the western state of Maharashtra. \"The citizens of the country must realize that they live in a nation and are duty bound to show respect to (the) national anthem,\" the justices said. Ministry of Home Affairs regulations already stipulate that Indians must stand to attention \"whenever the anthem is sung or played.\" In the past there have been reports of people being thrown out of venues or attacked for not showing respect to the anthem. However, many Indians have also criticized a recent trend toward aggressive displays of patriotism amid a rise in jingoism on television news and in the press. Pakistan banIt isn't the first time in recent months that national politics and the movies have intersected. In October, one of India's most famous movie directors announced he would no longer work with Pakistani talent.

{"_id":"India: US tourist alleges she was gang-raped in New Delhi hotel","articleText":"New Delhi (CNN)India's police say they are seriously investigating allegations that an American woman was drugged and raped by a group of men in her five-star hotel room in the country's capital earlier this year.The alleged incident took place on April 9 when an American woman in her early thirties was in New Delhi as part of a tour group.\"She says she was given something to drink that was spiked,\" said police spokesman, Dependra Pathak, in a telephone interview with CNN. \"When she gained consciousness, she knew she had been violated.\"New Delhi has an ugly reputation when it comes to the safety of women. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the capital has a rate of reported rapes that is four times higher than the national average.'Deeply troubling'Authorities in India first heard of the allegations in an e-mail last week from a nongovernmental organization representing the American woman in question. The alleged rape took place in the woman's hotel room in one of the capital's most popular tourist spots. Pathak said she could have been conned into letting the men into her room.\"Details are still fuzzy,\" said Pathak, adding that the police have now spoken to the victim herself. \"We are hoping she can come here and testify in front of a magistrate. We have already reached the main person accused and he has agreed to join the investigation and testify.\"According to Pathak, the main suspect works for a tour company that has operations around the world and he has denied the allegations so far. Pathak said the police had also zeroed in on the suspect's accomplices, who may have also been involved in the alleged rape.India's top diplomat has been vocal about the reports, calling for action in posts on her Twitter account. On Saturday, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted that she had asked the police to \"register a case and bring the guilty to book.\" Swaraj also said she had asked the Indian Ambassador in Washington to reach out to \"the victim and assure her that we will not spare the guilty.\"\"Such cases are deeply troubling,\" said Pathak. \"We are looking at all the angles and seeking expert and legal advice as well.\"Sexual violence awarenessSome 34,651 rapes were reported in India in 2015, but many experts believe the cases recorded are only a small fraction of the number of crimes committed, especially in a country where rapes can be perceived as deeply shameful for the victim and her family. Government data shows 95% of rapes in 2015 were committed by people known to their victims. The number of reported crimes have risen by 50% in the last five years; social commentators have pointed out that this is likely because there is more awareness and openness in India about sexual violence.Perhaps the most infamous and brutal rape in living Indian memory also occurred in New Delhi, in 2012, when a young medical student was gang-raped on a public bus, beaten, tortured, and then left to die. The tragic case and the ensuing protests drew national and then international media scrutiny. In part because of the attention from that case, India made a number of moves to toughen its punishments and set up fast-track courts.In recent years, a number of foreign tourists have also reported violent sexual crimes. Five men were sentenced to life in prison in June for the 2014 gang-rape of a Danish woman in New Delhi.

{"_id":"Inside Elton John's spectacular private photography collection ","articleText":"London (CNN)\"Hi, this is Elton,\" begins the audio guide. Sir Elton Hercules John is chatty and almost inescapable company on the tour of \"The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection\" at the Tate Modern in London, a selection of over 175 photographs from his extensive collection. In line with his star status, the musician is being lionized by the art world with this show, the first ever loan exhibition at Switch House, the striking new extension to Tate Modern designed by Herzog & de Meuron.It's clear from the photographs on display, that John is -- in the words of someone else's song -- \"a man of wealth and taste,\" and he's evidently thrilled about it.An aesthetic addictionElton John, who was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, doesn't take photographs himself and claims that he \"absolutely hates\" having his own picture taken.  He has made certain exceptions though -- he's sat for the late, great American photographers Richard Avedon and Irving Penn, happily surrendering as they moved his precious hands and fingers and chin for studio portraits. But while no fan of being the camera's subject, John clearly has an eye and collects photographs obsessively, with a particular passion for modernist photography from the first half of the 20th century. Read: A deeper look into the art world's most controversial awardJohn started collecting early, a decade before Tate Modern first showed serious interest in photography. Astonishingly, he's amassed over 8,000 photographs in the last 25 years, at one point purchasing at least four or five photographs a week. \"I became avaricious about it, like a kid in a candy store,\" he says on the audio guide. I ask the director of The Sir Elton John Photography Collection, Newell Harbin, whether the singer is perhaps addicted, and she hesitates momentarily. \"He's a passionate collector,\" she finally says and laughs, before noting that he is slowing down. The rate of acquisition is now  \"about one and half photographs a week,\" and their wish list has shrunk -- only about a dozen or so key early 20th century photos still to add -- although the quest for flawless vintage prints remains.  John describes photography as \" the love of my life, in art terms. I love surrounding myself with them.\" That's why, he says, he works so hard: so he can collect.Shared obsession\"The Radical Eye,\" mostly black and white vintage silver gelatin prints from the 1920s to the 1950s, invites us to share his obsession. The exhibition is intensely focused on that time when photography came of age and its practitioners began to seriously experiment with cameras and in the dark room.   Tate Modern doesn't provide anywhere to sit. You have to stand directly and closely in front of each photograph and immerse yourself. There are no big photographs and some are so small you have to stand just inches away.Read: Meet Shen Wei, the Chinese artist who explores the world with no clothesJohn has six homes but it's a huge penthouse apartment in Atlanta, Georgia -- some 1650 square meters  (18,000 square feet) -- where, among the leopard skin print chairs, the crucifixes, the starfish, all available wall space seems to have been given over to photographs, as many as six at a time, hanging from floor to ceiling. He shows us around on film, in black Adidas tracksuit, tinted glasses and a single chunky sparkling earring. You notice the frames, almost as much as the photographs.  Never solemn gallery black, they have to be flamboyant -- gold, white gold and silver. John has been using the same Atlanta framer, Myott, since he came out of rehab in 1990 and started collecting.  A grid of nine pictures from the wall of John's Atlanta study has been faithfully transferred to the opening room in the exhibition: images of a boy on a bicycle, a man's white stiff collar, some eggs, electric power lines and several portraits of the American photographer Edward Weston.Read: Johnny Depp's $12.7 million Art Deco show-stopperWithin this grid is a seminal purchase barely the size of a couple of thumbprints: a silver gelatin print of an underwater swimmer from the original 1917 contact sheet by the Hungarian master Andre Kertesz. You need a magnifying glass to appreciate its quality. John had already been given a large late 1970s print of it by a friend, but leaped at the chance to buy the pristine original. Under the mount are the marks left by  Kertesz's pen where he cropped the image.  He regards it as \"one of the most influential photos of the 20th century -- iconic, homoerotic,\" with Kertesz's brother swimming \"like a fish, like a salmon being caught out of stream.\"The image on the catalog cover is \"Glass Tears\" by Man Ray  (like John, someone who gave himself a new name) from 1932. The photographer made the image using a fashion mannequin and glass beads at the time of his breakup with his lover, the American photographer Lee Miller. Read: Mongolian life caught on cameraJohn acquired this vintage print at auction in 1993 for the then world record price for a photograph of $185,000. \"I thought I had gone stark raving mad but I had to have it,\" he writes in the catalog. \"Glass Tears\" has probably risen in value at least seven fold since 1993. Another vintage print of it (there are four or five variants) sold for $1.3 million in 2001. The show has 25 Man Rays in all, including a succession of studies of fellow artists in Paris -- Picasso with a full head of hair in 1922, Henri Matisse in 1923, the balding surrealist Yves Tanguy in 1935. John refers to the Tanguy photograph as \"the Phil Collins.\" Tanguy looks uncannily like him, just as the 1932 self-portrait by Austrian photographer Herbert Bayer \"looks like Jeff Koons.\"  \"Oh my God, my arms have fallen off. I have a piece in my hand. Very Dali-esque,\" muses John.  He can be teasingly provocative. In the catalog interview, he declares \"there is not a portrait in paint that could compare to a photographic portrait\".A lasting legacy John collects and is moved by photojournalism, old and new. He has photographs in this exhibition from the Great Depression in America by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. One is of a young girl, a pugnacious, world-weary little face in grubby dungarees from 1936. Lange has written on the back \"The Damage is Already Done.\" Among his collection are 2000 photos from 9/11, \"the most horrible subject matter, but the most moving photography. We get them out every year. Beautiful photographs, but they're too raw to show.\"  At the end of the audio guide, John takes a moment to reflect. \"We live in turbulent times, probably the most turbulent of my life,\" he says. \"With photos, you get a sense of what's happening and outrage.\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/arts/elton-john-tate-modern-radical-eye-photography/index.html"}
{"_id":"Inside Trump and Romney's Jean Georges dinner ","articleText":"Washington (CNN)If it was New Year's Eve, they could have spent $888 per head on a tasting menu. But instead, President-elect Donald Trump met potential secretary of state nominee Mitt Romney Tuesday at Jean Georges, a three-Michelin star New York City restaurant inside his Trump International Hotel. Instead of being joined by their wives, which was the original expectation, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was their only other guest. He was tapped by Trump to become his chief of staff when he enters the White House in January.The three men ordered a young garlic soup with thyme and sautéed frog legs, and diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion as appetizers, according to a readout to reporters.Priebus and Trump ordered a prime sirloin with citrus glazed carrots for their main course and Romney ordered lamb chops with a mushroom bolognese sauce. All three of the men had a chocolate cake for dessert.CNN asked Trump after the dinner if Romney will be the next secretary of state, to which he responded, \"Well, we're going to see what happens.\"And Romney addressed reporters in the lobby about the dinner, where he said he had a \"wonderful evening\" with Trump.\"We had another discussion about affairs throughout the world and these discussions I have had with him have been enlightening and interesting and engaging. I have enjoyed them very, very much,\" he said. He added: \"By the way, it's not easy winning. I know that myself. He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing. He won the general election. And he continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\"Despite their rocky past, Trump and Romney didn't show any animosity whatsoever between each other, as servers dressed in neckties and vests carried out their duties. The three men appeared animated and smiling, as seen by a CNN reporter also in the dining room. Source: Trump 'irritated' by Conway attacks on RomneyThe fight between Romney, the Republican Party's 2012 nominee, and Trump was nasty and personal.After Romney said he didn't expect Trump to win the GOP nomination and called some of the real estate mogul's past comments \"childish in some respects,\" Trump tweeted: \".@MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible \"choke\" loss to Obama!\" A few months later, Romney unloaded on Trump, calling him a \"phony, a fraud\" and asking Republicans to unite against him. Trump fired back, saying that he could have forced Romney to his knees in 2012 when Romney sought his endorsement. \"He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees' -- he would have dropped to his knees,\" Trump said.Romney's speech sparked a furious back-and-forth that only ended after the election when, in a stunning turn, the two met to discuss Romney becoming secretary of state. Since that meeting, conservative backers of Trump have been openly bashing Romney, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.On Sunday, Priebus downplayed any fighting behind the scenes, suggesting that picking Romney would make for a good \"team of rivals\" for Trump.\"He's going to be making the best decision for the American people. It isn't a matter of warfare. I mean, there's a lot of opinions about this and, yes, it is sort of a 'team of rivals' concept if you were to go towards the Gov. Romney concept,\" Priebus said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"Romney has also stirred up emotions among Trump aides. Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, first opened a window on the infighting in Trump's transition over who should win the powerful role as the nation's top diplomat, when she tweeted on Thanksgiving about concerns with Romney. \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state,\" she tweeted, including a link to a Politico story.Romney has been scrapping behind the scenes with Rudy Giuliani for the post, although alternative options have emerged, including former Gen. David Petraeus and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker.Conway told CNN's Dana Bash Sunday on \"State of the Union\" that much of the anger, which has boiled over in public, stems from the personal attacks Romney lobbed at him. \"There was the Never Trump movement and then there was Mitt Romney he gave speeches against Donald Trump, he attacked his character,\" Conway said. A source in Trump's campaign told CNN that Trump was \"irritated\" with Conway's public campaign against Romney's potential nomination for the position.CNN's Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/donald-trump-mitt-romney-jean-georges/index.html"}

{"_id":"Iraqi battle for Mosul prompts fears of more sectarian violence","articleText":" (CNN)Iraqi paramilitary forces are in a raging battle to take a key ISIS stronghold west of Mosul, but their presence is prompting fears that the fighting could result in the escalation of sectarian violence in Iraq.The Shia-led Popular Mobilization Units, or PMUs, have significantly advanced against ISIS in the Tal Afar area, with the help of the Iraqi air force targeting the terror group and killing 12 militants, according to Iraq's Joint Operations Command.Tal Afar is a predominantly Sunni city that was divided between Sunni and Shia Turkmens before ISIS captured it in 2014.For a month, an Iraqi-led coalition has waged a military operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-most populous city and ISIS' last major stronghold in the country.'This means another civil war'The PMU released a statement Friday saying their forces are surrounding the town from the west and the south. Three days ago, paramilitary forces took the strategically important Tal Afar air base, which can serve as a launching point in the battle with ISIS west of Mosul. Tal Afar is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul.Izzeddin Aldola, a member of the Iraqi parliament who represent Sunnis from the Tal Afar area, told CNN by phone of fears about PMU forces entering the city.  \"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised us that only the Iraqi army will enter Tal Afar,\" Aldola said. \"We are very worried,  and even if only people from Tal Afar fight ISIS in the city, this means another civil war.\" On Friday, Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization and a PMU commander, said in a video released by the group: \"We will let the sons of Tal Afar liberate Tal Afar, and if they need our help, then we are ready.\"Those fighting for Tal Afar, Amiri continued, will be citizens of that city. An Iraqi military brigade will fight alongside the Hashd al Shabi, another name for PMU -- which includes a Shia paramilitary group called Sons of Tal Afar, a Sunni Hashd paramilitary also from Tal Afar, and members of the federal police.The Amiri statement appears to leave the door open to Shia paramilitaries entering into the battle for Tal Afar.Tension between Baghdad government, KurdsFurther complicating the Mosul offensive, the Iraqi Prime Minister has maintained that Kurdish forces must withdraw from towns captured from ISIS once the terror group has been defeated. Tensions are mounting between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government over future control of the territory in northern Iraq.Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga, are playing a critical role in the battle to defeat the terror group, fighting alongside Iraqi government troops and other forces in the coalition to retake Mosul, the capital of Nineveh province. But cracks are emerging in the anti-ISIS partnership over the question of what the semiautonomous Kurdish Regional Government plans for areas it captures from the terror group.Kurdish President Massoud Barzani and Abadi have released statements in recent days that underline their conflicting positions.Barzani said he wouldn't permit residents who had supported ISIS to return to liberated villages, signaling Sunni Arabs may not be welcome. \"We have shed a lot of precious blood to liberate areas from (ISIS),\" he said at a press conference Wednesday. A report this week from Human Rights Watch also accused the Kurds of unlawfully targeting and destroying  Arab homes in regions they have retaken from ISIS.Kurdish officials strongly denied any systematic destruction of Arab-owned homes, and Barzani dismissed the report as \"unfair.\"In July, Barzani told Human Rights Watch the Kurdish Regional Government would not allow Sunni Arabs to return to villages that Saddam Hussein had \"Arabized.\" In his view, those are historically Kurdish lands needed for a potential future independent Kurdistan, which Barzani has long championed.Abadi has reiterated that the agreement under which Iraqi federal forces and Peshmerga were cooperating in Nineveh province stated that the Kurds must return to their previous positions after the battle was won.Numerous disputed territories in Iraq are nominally under Baghdad's jurisdiction but controlled and claimed by the Kurdistan Regional Government.Editor's note: A previous version of the story incorrectly identified the Shia paramilitary group Sons of Tal Afar as the sole group fighting to liberate the city, in a quote attributed to Hadi al-Amiri.CNN's Steve Visser, Tim Hume and Yasmin Amer contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/middleeast/battle-for-mosul-tal-afar/index.html"}
{"_id":"Ironman triathlon: Three grueling races in one","articleText":"Cambridge, Maryland (CNN)Swim, bike and run. In that order. And that's basically it. The deceptively simple idea for the popular sport of triathlon is built upon a triple challenge that pushes one's body and mental perseverance to reach beyond a single discipline.And \"tris,\" as its athletes call them, are now so popular -- with roughly half a million participants each year -- you could say that triathlons are the new marathons. That's remarkable given the modernity of the sport, organized in the United States less than 40 years ago. Its entry into the Olympics, starting in 2000, and televised Ironman triathlon competitions have a lot to do with its surge in participation, but the unique combination of disciplines and the über-workout it provides are the big appeal.Another attraction is that the sport can be a combination of individual accomplishment and familial support. \"There's an incredible bonding among athletes,\" said Gerry Boyle, a race organizer. \"They will go out of their way to help other athletes achieve their individual goals.\"  Les trois sportsTriathlon's origins can be traced to France, near the town of Joinville-le-Pont, outside Paris. There, in the 1920s, athletes would compete in les trois sports: crossing the Marne river, about 500 feet, followed by a 12-kilometer bike ride and a 3-kilometer run.The first modern organized triathlon took place in 1974 in San Diego, followed four years later by the first Ironman race, in Hawaii. USA Triathlon is the sport's official governing body in America, and the International Triathlon Union is its global counterpart; together, they oversee thousands of races every year around the globe.  In the early days, triathlons varied according to individual races, but now there are four popular standard lengths. A Sprint is usually a half-mile swim, a 20-kilometer bike ride and a 5-kilometer run. An Olympic distance triathlon is a 1.5-kilometer swim, a 40-kilometer ride and a 10-kilometer run. A \"full\" or Ironman-length triathlon is a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile ride and a 26.2-mile run. A \"half\" or \"70.3\" is simply half a full Ironman. Beginners can enter any of these. You don't have to complete a Sprint or Olympic distance before you enter an Ironman, for example, but prudently, many do.As for being competitive, fitness and grit are obviously factors, but so are individual courses and conditions. Rough open waters may be a challenge for some swimmers and an opportunity for others. The same is true of hills while running and biking. And then there is the weather, which is as predicable as, well, the weather.'You are an Ironman!'The conditions in Kona, Hawaii, where the annual Ironman world championship is held, are unique. The open water is warm enough to swim without a wetsuit. And temperatures and winds are often high. The competition is the best of all the year's races, which can be daunting mentally.The popular Ironman events originated with a combination of three pre-existing events: the Waikiki Rough Water Swim, the Oahu Bike Race and the Honolulu Marathon. The distances of those three are the same covered in hundreds of Ironmans in 37 countries and 48 American states today. NBC began airing the Ironman World Championship in 1991, which gave the impression to a lot of fascinated viewers that triathlon, and Ironman in particular, was an extreme sport. But with its growing popularity in recent years, explained Jeff Edwards, Ironman's vice president of operations, \"a bit of the mystique has been removed.\"Ironman certifies coaches for training, and Edwards said you can draw a connection between coaching and \"favorable outcomes,\" but he adds that the No.1 factor for Ironman success is persistence. \"It's truly remarkable how much our athletes endure and how many things they sacrifice to get to the finish line,\" he said.To a degree not found in many other competitions, the finish line of Ironman is moving. The announcer will call out each racer coming across, often near collapse, and announce \"You are an Ironman!\" Even as a spectator, it makes the hair stand on the back of your neck. Or as Edwards put it, \"We find, universally, the end is emotionally intense.\"On the bonnie shores of the Chesapeake BayA small town along the eastern coast of the Chesapeake Bay, Cambridge, Maryland, is like a lot of its neighbors: a patch of local businesses surrounded by the houses of its 13,000 residents and the beauty of water, marshland and woods. But one distinction is that this city has been hosting official Ironman-branded triathlons for 20 years.As the host of the state's only Ironman, it proudly swells to capacity for the event. The swim takes place in the brackish water of the tidal bay (the country's largest estuary). The bike ride extends into an outer loop that includes views of farmland and wooded marsh. And the run loops through the town's neighborhoods and past the new brewery and other local businesses. The appeal for some of the nearly 2,000 participants is that, at 11 feet above sea level, \"It's dead flat,\" said Boyle, the organizer of Ironman Maryland.\"There is a perception that it's going to be easy. But it can be a deceptively difficult course. Winds can change. The open water swim is in tidal water. It's a very different course than most others.\" Even the flatness of the bike course sounds good but essentially means you never get a downhill break.And at this year's competition in October, the winds were gusting at 20 to 25 miles an hour. Kayakers monitoring the course couldn't stay in place. Waiting until the last hopeful minute, lifeguards finally declared the water unsafe. \"Too many people,\" explained Boyle. \"Risk too high.\"Many participants were visibly disappointed, and cold, as they walked along a muddy path in their swimsuits to retrieve their bikes. But they still had more than 100 miles to ride and then a marathon to run, so they would still be earning their Ironman titles that day. And perseverance, no matter what happens, is the spirit of the sport.\"Race day was a swing of emotions,\" recalled Boyle. \"Last-minute changes to the route. Canceling the swim. Astronomically high tides. Roads were flooded.\" The organizers focused on keeping athletes' spirits as high as possible, an effort buoyed by the American flags handed out on the last leg of the run, words of encouragement from fellow racers (\"You got this, man,\" a common refrain), by DJs and dancers wearing glowsticks for the many runners who finished after dark, and signs of encouragement from friends and family. \"One step at a time, sweetie.\" \"We've traveled many miles together.\"\"I love you, Daddy.\"For the 1,903 Ironman women and men who completed the Maryland race race -- including John Young, the first competitor with dwarfism, and Murray Sarubin, age 75 -- they were met with the customary \"You are an Ironman!\" salute as an inspiring run mix of songs blared. Add in the family and fellow racers jumping up and down and cheering under huge spotlights on the final 50 yards, and every finish feels as dramatic as another. As punishing as Ironman is, it's also not hard to see the appeal.Risks and rewards of trisIf you wanted to design a competition that thoroughly worked your body aerobically, you would probably create a triathlon. Experts often recommend diversifying activity, known as cross-training, as the ideal exercise routine, and that is the modus operandi of triathlons.This physical diversity also opens the sport, competitively, to more body types. Long-distance runners tend to be lean and light, and cyclists have over-developed legs, while the best swimmers are tall with long arms and torsos. So being a triathlete means you can find advantages in any one, or combinations, of those types.As you train, you are largely developing a suite of body parts known as the \"tri muscles\": chest, shoulders and lats while swimming and quads, hamstrings, glutes and calves while biking and running. Your core muscles, such as abs and lower back, also get developed for stability.Many first-timers find that they have at least one area where they clearly need work, and that's usually swimming. For many, it's harder to make pool time (much less in open water) than it is to fit running and biking around your schedule.There are different schools of thought of the benefits of training solo or in groups, and it may come down to how social you are or whether you love all that time alone with your thoughts. Beginners may want to join a training group for support, learning and even safety. And professional trainers give needed guidance in areas for improvement, as well.Either way, tri training is a big time commitment. A modest regime of interval training for a Sprint tri may be around two hours a day on average (with longer sessions on weekends). The average amount for Ironman can reach up to 20 hours a week -- that's an average of nearly three hours a day. Training can be so frequent that sleep and work may feel like recovery times between sessions.Another important factor that must be mastered during training: proper hydration and calorie intake while racing. Without enough fuel, you won't make it to the finish line.In theory, there should be fewer injuries in triathlon training than in other sports because you avoid repetitive stress problems associated with training in a single event. The research is conflicted on this point, but it does seem clear that the majority of injuries stem from running, usually from overuse stress or overextension.There are other risks, especially among middle-age men. Due to the intensity of triathlons and the added risk of swimming, the death rate for triathletes is about twice that of marathon runners, according to a 2012 study in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The number of incidents is very low, however.For those older than 40, the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation recommends getting a cardiovascular checkup before training. The foundation did a study of 109 deaths in races between 1985 and 2015 that illuminated the heart risk with intense exertion. Half of the deaths occurred in shorter Sprint triathlons. Of those deaths, 70% took place during the swimming portion.  Even if a competitor is a strong swimmer and has trained properly, race day in open water with hundreds of other swimmers crowded together can be a stressful and potentially dangerous situation. If a swimmer panics, that can restrict breathing and turn deadly. Cardiac arrest may have played a role in some deaths as well.And finally, triathlons are not cheap. A racing bike is the biggest-ticket item, but you also need running kicks, a body swimsuit (coverage depends on temperature of the water), a helmet, sunglasses, bike tools, a running belt, a fitness monitor and goggles.But most triathletes add that together for an experience that is priceless. For them, it's all totally worth it. One event, plus one event, plus one more grueling event equals bragging rights for the rest of your life.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/ironman-maryland-fit-nation/index.html"}
{"_id":"Is Italy's referendum result the first step toward leaving the EU? ","articleText":" (CNN)After a resounding loss at the polls for his constitutional reforms package, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has announced his intention to resign. The outcome of Sunday's vote has thrown the country into renewed political turmoil, with the prospect of a sixth prime minister in a decade and frenzied talk that Italy could follow the UK and hold a referendum on its future in the European Union. What happens now?Italian President Sergio Mattarella is the man calling the plays on how the political situation will unfold. Renzi met Monday with Mattarella and offered his resignation, but he has been asked to remain until a budget bill has been approved on December 23. Mattarella then has two options: Accept Renzi's resignation or reject his offer to step down, telling him to reshape his Cabinet and prioritize completing his mandate. If Renzi were asked to stay on, he would have to seek a vote of confidence from Parliament. The more likely scenario is that Mattarella will order the formation of a caretaker government led by a member of Renzi's Cabinet or a technocrat (someone with appropriate experience in government but not a politician). The impact on Italy's financial markets will play a part, said Wolfango Piccoli, director of research at the global advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. Reaction so far has been fairly mild, but should the prospect of instability in the eurozone's third-largest economy move the markets significantly, he suggests Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a close ally of Matterella's whom investors largely respect, would be a front-runner. \"But the problem with him is that he will be seen as a continuity and that will spark further criticism from the (anti-establishment) Five Star Movement, (former Prime Minister Silvio) Berlusconi and so on,\" Piccoli told CNN. \"If not Padoan, it could either be an institutional figure -- think about a former judge of the constitutional court, a safe pair of hands, or the speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso.\" He added, \"But at the end of the day, the name itself is not going to make a huge difference -- this is going to be a short-lived caretaker government with a very narrow mandate.\" The next general election is scheduled for 2018, but it remains unclear if the interim government would wait and finish out the end of the parliamentary term or go to the polls earlier. Who benefits? Following the \"No\" vote victory, opposition parties have called for a dissolution of Parliament and snap elections, but such moves would be unlikely.  Piccoli said \"a coterie of anti-establishment parties\" could gain from the win -- the most notable being the Five Star Movement and Northern League as well as another small extreme right-wing party, the Brothers of Italy. Last year an electoral law, intended to build more stable governments, was passed that would give extra seats in Parliament to any party receiving votes of 40% or more. However, there is a constitutional court ruling pending on the law. Mainstream establishment parties will want a rewrite on this bill before any early elections in an effort to prevent far-right populist parties from making significant gains in power. \"Electoral law will be used to somewhat defuse the risk of a Five Star Movement victory in the next election,\" Piccoli said. \"(These calls are) more about the claims that they won (Sunday) and that it is a major defeat for Renzi so the next step is an early election. But we know that (an) early election won't happen until the electoral system is changed, and this will take months, not weeks.\" Is Italy more likely to leave the EU?Whatever shorthand word the media settle on -- \"Itexit,\" \"Quitaly\" or \"Italexit\" -- the stage is slowly being set for a battle over Italy's place in the EU. Far-right parties will want to capitalize on the momentum of the referendum victory and call for Italy's exit from the eurozone repeatedly in the coming months.And while the loss of Renzi's reforms proposal hands Italy's EU skeptics a stronger mandate, it's not yet enough, Piccoli said.\"This was a vote against Renzi so it shouldn't be read as a vote against the euro, against the establishment,\" he said. \"It is clear that the alarm bells have gone off in Italy now. ... There is going to be a certain sense of alarmism, but this is not a vote that will necessarily change the projection of Italy in the short term.\"The result will certainly embolden the two important opposition movements -- the Five Star Movement and Northern League, said Chris Bickerton, a lecturer at Cambridge University and author of \"The European Union: A Citizen's Guide.\" But actually tabling a vote on Italy's inclusion in the eurozone is still a long way off.\"It's pretty far-fetched as an immediate possibility,\" Bickerton told CNN. Instead, he said, Italians are now much more open to voting for parties that run on a more euroskeptic platform.\"It's a country that for so long has been one of the most enthusiastic countries for European integration. But I think over the last 10 years you'd have to say that that has changed.\"He said suggestions the referendum could ultimately lead to Italy's exit from the EU are, at this point, \"exaggerated.\"\"What (the result) does tell us ... is that a lot of people in Italy lost any sort of faith they put in Renzi as a reforming new figure in Italian politics,\" Bickerton said. \"Since Italy joined the euro in 1999, it simply hasn't grown on average. It's had an average growth rate of zero so people do put two and two together and think this suggests that its place within the eurozone is not a very good idea.\" He added: \"Going from there to actually working out the mechanics of getting a referendum to leave the euro is something else. There is a climate in Italy of growing euroskepticism and certainly anti-establishment feeling -- that's very clear. The implications for the EU specifically, I think, are probably less clear.\" ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/europe/italy-referendum-whats-next/index.html"}
{"_id":"Is design as good as gold? Experts share their tips for entering the market ","articleText":" (CNN)Luther Vandross famously crooned \"A chair is still a chair/Even when there's no one sittin' there.\" But is a chair still just a chair when it sells for a cool £2.43 million ($3.74 million)? When designer Marc Newson's Lockheed Lounge chair hit the block at Phillips in London in April 2015, it broke the world record for the most expensive work of contemporary design ever sold at auction and proved that the market is on fire. While vintage wares from late greats like Jean Prouvé, Jean Royère, Carlo Mollino and Gio Ponti have long fetched eye-popping sums at auction, the Lockheed sale -- though undoubtedly an anomaly -- hinted that contemporary designers working today are capable of being as hot a commodity as their predecessors. Read: How to build a stylish home for less than $30K (hint: use cardboard)The good news for budding design enthusiasts is that the majority of the contemporary design market still is much more accessible, and an exciting space for novice collectors to explore. As Design Miami kicks off, offering up the best of both vintage and contemporary goods, CNN Style asked four design world insiders about the current state of the market and the best ways for first-time buyers to dive in. The consensus? While it's tempting to believe that design is a wise investment (and it very well may be), collecting should always come from the heart and be for the love of design, rather than future gains. Rodman Primack: Chief Creative Officer of Design Miami Why do you think there seems to be a growing interest in design globally?The market is growing alongside -- and because of -- the contemporary art market, which has boomed over the last 10-15 years. The art market has gotten so hot and the prices so high. It's a reality that, by comparison, you are able to enter the design market more easily, and you can spend not-too-much and get something great. With art, you're buying it and putting it on the wall or behind protection -- generally not touching or using it, per se. The exact opposite is true with design. In most cases it has functionality, so you can buy something that is collectible and rare, but you can be sitting on it or using it on a daily basis. The sense of preciousness is very different, and I think that's appealing to people.Where contemporary art sometimes feels like something that one needs to have a lot of education about to really connect with, design is much more direct.Read: Could this smog-eating tower solve China's pollution problem?What advice would you give to a novice collector?It always makes sense to collect what you're interested in. Whether that's a particular designer or a particular kind of object, it's a really good strategy to focus on a specific area and try to collect it in depth. Be attuned to what excites you. Connect with that emotional moment of \"I love it.\" Your temperature might rise, your pulse might quicken, and those moments are important to be aware of as a collector. Follow your instincts. There's no wrong way to start a collection, or get into the market, unless you're just looking to other people and copying what they're doing. You've got to try and connect with something that's exciting to you personally. What are some of the trends you've noticed on the design market? Something that we've seen over the last few years is a re-appreciation of craft and the handmade. There's less of a love for technology for the love of technology -- I think we're over the moment of being excited by the tech itself, and now it's about those things servicing the industry in the background. Who are the designers we should be keeping an eye on? There are many designers out there that I'm excited by, so I have to underline that there are a great deal more than the ones I mention here, who I admire, collect, and watch with enthusiasm. Max Lamb's practice I really like. The American designer Jonathan Muecke is great, as is the Spanish designer Tomás Alonso, and the British designer Bethan Laura Wood -- just to name a few! Read: Stronger than concrete? Why this new material could define our ageWhich cities are emerging as new design hubs? Mexico City. It's such an interesting place from an art, architecture and design perspective; it has been for a long time. There have been great things happening there for centuries, but there seems to be a real energy and shift around what's happening there right now. Johanna Agerman Ross: Curator of 20th Century and Contemporary Furniture and 20th Century Product Design at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London Why do you think there seems to be a growing interest in design globally?You've definitely seen a rise over the past 10 years in design coverage in the media, from magazines to blogs, and there are more design exhibitions and fairs than ever, so I think a more general audience has come to understand and appreciate design. It has become more accessible, if you will. Because it's more prominent and talked-about, it feels perhaps like there is a lower risk factor now for people to invest in modern or contemporary design. What advice would you give to a novice collector?Figure out what interests you, and understand what designer or period or part of the world appeals to you most. If you are going to invest in building a collection, it's important to have passion and stamina, because otherwise you'll lose interest. The strongest collections take time and persistence. Find the connection points that works for you, and then it becomes a meaningful journey and not some exercise in buying something and hoping you can sell it for a bit more a few years down the line. Read: Design lessons from the world's smartest schools I also think it's also important not to move too quickly. Do your homework and understand the market; go see things and think for yourself and don't feel pressured to act. Watch and wait, and build a strategy for how you want to move ahead. Who are the designers we should be keeping an eye on? I think it's intriguing to contemplate the designers working in digital media today, like Random International or Simon Heijdens. Their work's physicality isn't necessarily as we perceive it. It's really interesting to see how that sector continues to grow, with the Museum of Modern Art doing shows like \"Design and the Elastic Mind,\" which really help to highlight a new approach that goes beyond design as just a product or object. What are some of the trends you've noticed on the design market? Material innovation and exploration are strong themes at the moment. I think it has to do with a certain anxiety around the design profession, amidst global warming and sustainability issues. We are questioning how much and how frequently we consume, and a lot of designers are preoccupied with these issues, but not in a superficial \"Let's make eco design\" way. Rather, it's about looking at resources and considering whether they are renewable and making things that endure. It's an intellectual query through design that I think is really important. Read: Here's what 'Made in China' really looks likeWhich cities are emerging as new design hubs? China is a burgeoning market in terms of both design consumption and practice. I'm excited to see Eastern Europe opening up more -- you have the Biennial of Design in Ljubljana, Slovenia getting a lot of attention, as merely one example. Mexico and Brazil also have so much going on, but perhaps haven't been in the spotlight as much as they should be. I think it's interesting to see a shift away from London, Milan and so forth. Collectors and institutions alike definitely need to pay attention and make an effort to engage with less obvious places. Alexander Payne: Deputy Chairman, Europe, and Worldwide Head of Design at Phillips  Why do you think there seems to be a growing interest in design globally?Design continuously inspires people for their homes, their interiors, and I think it is a very personal and individual arena to collect in. It becomes a part of how you live and your expression of style and taste, and people are always interested in communicating that. We have indeed seen a continuous growth on the design market with new buyers streaming in, with a particular focus on 20th- and 21st-century work.Read: Top designers turn their creativity to cocktailsBut people are also increasingly looking to great galleries to incorporate new, exciting, and cutting-edge contemporary works into their collection. In time we will see these younger names come to the auction market, once enough time has elapsed for us to see which designers endure and which works become truly iconic objects. What advice would you give to a novice collector?You should approach collecting with passion, great drive and determination. Stay true to your individual taste and style, but also consider provenance and exhibition history, and try to acquire works that are the best output by that particular designer. Really, the passage of time and a great eye will yield all the wonderful joys and gratifications of being a savvy collector. There will always be confidence surrounding an honest piece with great integrity, and value will follow from it having what I like to think of as an essential quality that captures the designer's ethos.Who are the designers we should be keeping an eye on? There is currently a kind of synergy between design, innovation, material experimentation and engineering, and a renaissance of craft, which is creating very stimulating works and makes it a very exciting moment to collect contemporary design. Someone like Joris Laarman is a phenomenally important young designer, and his work is already in some of the most exciting design collections Read: 37 countries showcase their visions of utopia Which cities are emerging as new design hubs? One place of many that I have a keen eye on at the moment is Seoul. There's a very exciting scene developing there. Brent Dzekciorius: Founder of Dzek and design editorWhy do you think there seems to be a growing interest in design globally?I think it's definitely related to approachability. The design marketplace is relatively small compared to the art market, and we forge relationships with these functional objects -- furniture, design products -- from birth. We interact with these things and we have, even if it's subconscious, a very intimate understanding of how they serve our lives. So I think people feel like they need less of a formal understanding of design, as it's all around us.I also think that between Instagram, Pinterest, all the designs blogs and the glossy magazines, we have an increased awareness of an aesthetic lifestyle. We are inundated with potent images, and it's so easy to latch onto those things and think \"Oh, that looks like a great way to live.\" What advice would you give to a novice collector?I would say the most important thing to know is that there is no rush. The fairs often create a sense of urgency, but there really isn't an urgency to buy anything, especially in the contemporary market. Read: Fireworks of the future? Japan to create fake shooting starsThese designers are living and working today, which means the work will be available and you can potentially have an amazing discourse about their work, which is really gratifying. You're doing something to keep the creative cycle moving forward by buying their work. It's an act of patronage.All contemporary design should be bought because you love it, and it's shouldn't be bought with speculation in mind because you're going to have to hold on to it for a long time before it starts attaining the same kind of value as the vintage market. Chairs are an easy place to start. I think most great collections probably started with a chair. They're relatable and we all need them. Who are the designers we should be keeping an eye on? I'm kind of always stuck in my world of who I've worked in some capacity, so of course Max Lamb is on the list, as are Faye Toogood, Tomás Alonso, and Formafantasma. Read: Incredible buildings that used to be jailsWhat are some of the trends you've noticed on the design market? There is a realignment of values. Designers and clients want to make and purchase things that are made with someone's hands, or things that at least have a trace of human engagement. Which cities are emerging as new design hubs? Amsterdam has a quite nice little scene, Rotterdam as well. And LA -- it's not just on the art scene anymore, there's a real renaissance on the design front.

{"_id":"Is genocide unfolding in Myanmar?","articleText":"Matthew Smith is co-founder and CEO of Fortify Rights. Follow him on Twitter @matthewfsmith. The opinions expressed here are solely his. (CNN)Four years ago, I was in Myanmar's Rakhine State soon after deadly violence erupted between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and stateless Rohingya Muslims. It was a horrendous scene. And it's happening again.Back then, Buddhist civilians and state security forces unleashed coordinated attacks against Rohingya and other Muslims. I documented pre-dawn raids and cold-blooded massacres.In a small village in Mrauk-U Township on October 23, 2012, 70 Rohingya were killed, including 28 children -- 13 under the age of 5. Children were hacked to death. Some were thrown into fires.Entire villages were razed; smoke billowed from homes and mosques in 13 of 17 townships statewide and bodies were disposed in mass graves, none of which have been exhumed for forensic purposes. I personally documented four separate mass gravesites.At the time, an unpublished United Nations investigation obtained by Al Jazeera's investigative unit, found more than 100 Rohingya women and girls were raped. The authorities then corralled more than 130,000 Rohingya into more than 40 squalid interment camps, where they remain confined today.This all happened under former President Thein Sein, a longtime military general lauded by the West as a reformer.Now Nobel-laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is State Counselor, the de facto head of state --and the same atrocities are happening again.The recent violenceOn October 9, a group of Rohingya men and boys allegedly attacked three police outposts in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships, killing nine police. This was highly unusual. Despite unending persecution, Rohingya militancy hasn't been seen for decades.The Myanmar military commenced a full-on offensive that's ongoing in northern Rakhine State -- a veritable black zone sealed off from aid workers and international observers.We've documented unlawful killings of unarmed Rohingya men, and we've steadily received allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women and girls by army soldiers. Helicopter gunners opened fire from the sky and entire villages have burned, evidenced by high-resolution satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch.Meantime, the civilian government and military continue to block all access to affected areas. Pre-existing aid programs, which were keeping thousands of Rohingya alive, have been suspended for eight weeks.According to the UN, the authorities are denying at least 130,000 men, women and children access to humanitarian aid -- food, nutrition and health care. Thirty thousand are likely displaced in the blackout zone. An estimated 3,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.Without urgent aid, they will likely die.Nearly all of the international aid workers in Maungdaw Township have left as the government has not renewed their travel authorizations. Independent monitors and media are still barred.'They will kill us': The Rohingya refugees fleeing torture and rape in MyanmarState-run media has claimed international journalists and human rights groups are working \"hand in glove\" with terrorists. It has alluded to Rohingya as a \"thorn\" that \"has to be removed,\" and as \"detestable human fleas.\"Make no mistake: this is genocide talk. And it is happening with Aung San Suu Kyi's imprimatur.Suu Kyi's culpabilityThe dominant narrative suggests Suu Kyi's hands are tied and that she has no control over the military. This is a half-truth.Is The Lady listening? Aung San Suu Kyi accused of ignoring Myanmar's MuslimsBy law, the military controls the ministries of Defense, Home Affairs and Border Affairs. These are instrumental ministries with respect to abuses in northern Rakhine State and Suu Kyi doesn't control them.But in military lockstep, the State Counselor's office has flatly denied any abuses may have taken place since October 9. And she's since doubled down, accusing the international community of \"always drumming up cause for bigger fires of resentment.Her office has demanded apologies from the BBC and the UN's refugee agency after the latter alleged \"ethnic cleansing\" was taking place.Moreover, Suu Kyi does control the ministries of Information, Foreign Affairs and others, and she could swiftly renew travel authorizations for aid workers. But she isn't.No one in the country has as much moral authority to change public opinion and counteract hate speech as Suu Kyi.So UN officials and governments are rightly sounding alarms. The UN Special Advisor on genocide prevention last week called for urgent action while the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights alleged again that crimes against humanity may be taking place. The US government called for a \"credible and independent investigation,\" a call echoed by various Asian parliaments in recent weeks.But this is not enough. Left to its own devices, Myanmar will continue to destroy this ethnic and religious minority. We can't let that happen.What can be doneIn his final days in office, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon should travel to Myanmar and personally ensure the authorities provide immediate and unfettered access to all populations in need in Rakhine State. Any failure to end this despicable aid blockade will result in significant loss of life -- indeed, it likely already has.In addition, UN member states should push for a UN Commission of Inquiry into what is happening in Rakhine State.In August, Aung San Suu Kyi appointed an \"Advisory Commission\" on Rakhine State, which is led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Fortify Rights welcomed the move, but Annan himself has said the commission does not intend to focus on human rights. It's unclear if that directive comes from him or the State Counselor, but regardless, for the Rohingya, it's a problem.Suu Kyi: Myanmar needs 'national reconciliation and peace'Annan is expected to address the press this afternoon following a three-day guided tour of Rakhine State. We don't expect him to address ongoing human rights violations, but he should. At this point, it's a moral imperative.His commission isn't the only one expected to abandon human rights. Last week, Suu Kyi's government appointed yet another body to look into the situation in Rakhine State since since October 9. It has all the markings of a whitewash -- it's led by retired army general Myint Swe, a man formerly blacklisted by the US government -- and doesn't include a single Muslim commissioner.Now is the time for independent UN-mandated Commission of Inquiry to address the totality of the human rights situation in Rakhine State, including grievances from the Rakhine Buddhist communities.Such an investigation would provide much-needed credibility and could cooperate with Kofi Annan's team while also delving deep to establish the facts, identify perpetrators and make recommendations to end, once and for all, the cycle of atrocity crimes against Rohingya -- before it's too late.Aung San Suu Kyi appears to be watching a possible genocide unfold. The international community must not.Editor's Note -- Matthew Smith is co-founder and CEO of Fortify Rights. Follow him on Twitter @matthewfsmith.

{"_id":"Is there a new human species waiting to be discovered?","articleText":" (CNN)It may be time to add more branches to the human family tree. Researchers have come up with a estimation tool to determine the traits we have in common with early humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans, and how our histories crossed paths. In the process of comparing these ancient populations from 50,000 to 70,000 years ago against modern ones, the researchers encountered an intriguing question mark. When looking at the process of admixture, the transfer of genes from one isolated population to another, they realized that ancient human history might be more complex than previously thought.When applied to the modern populations of Europe and East Asia, the model works reasonably well. But within the modern population of Pacific Islanders living in Melanesia -- which includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands -- the model suggests that something is missing in the equation. \"We're missing a lineage, a branch of this tree that we've assumed has four populations on it: two archaic and two modern,\" said Ryan Bohlender, a population geneticist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and first author on the research. \"One possible explanation for why the model doesn't work is that one of the branches that we're missing is another archaic population.\"Does this mean there is a third extinct human species primarily contributing to modern DNA? It's a possibility but not the only option.\"I think it's important to keep in mind that we're not specific about what the model doesn't include, which is the possibility that there was another important modern population,\" Bohlender said. \"There was a paper a couple of weeks ago that found results that indicated there might have been an earlier migration wave, and that could also effect our results.\"The estimation tool and the researchers' findings were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting this month.Melanesia first became a part of the human ancestor conversation when Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA was sequenced completely for the first time in 2010. Scientists found that the population of Papua New Guinea received the most DNA from Denisovans. Since the genome data became widely available to researchers, more studies have included Melanesia to further define the link. Using their equation, Bohlender's team estimates that there is a lower amount of Denisovan DNA within the current population of Melanesians than expected. Initially, research suggested that they could have 3% to 6% Denisovan DNA, with the rest coming from more modern sources. The new model points to 1.1%. That difference is creating the missing link. Now, with more questions than answers, Bohlender's collaborator Alan Rogers, a professor of anthropology at the University of Utah, will work on a tool that allows for more flexible modeling and compares which might solve their equation: an additional modern population or an additional archaic population. The genome Neanderthal DNA sequencing is creating a giant collaborative effort by scientists to better understand our origins, Bohlender said. Sequencing Neanderthal DNA led to the discovery that they interbred with the ancestors of modern Europeans. Researchers have only a few bones that even point to the existence of Denisovans, but fossilized DNA that could be sequenced has allowed us to learn more about them. This year, new studies suggested that both Neanderthals and Denisovans interbred with our ancestors. More studies that look at African populations can further our understanding of who we are and where we came from, Bohlender said. More research could even answer the question of whether there are more early human ancestors waiting to be discovered.\"There is more diversity in Africa than there is anywhere else in the world, and it seems to be very clear at this point that this is where we all came from,\" he said. \"But it's hard to work that far back in the past. There is a more considerable amount of work being done right now to sequence more African genomes, but it will take a while for that data to be studied and added to our current understanding.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/health/human-neanderthal-denisovan-dna-equation/index.html"}
{"_id":"Is there another message behind Pope Francis' abortion letter?","articleText":"Heidi Schlumpf is a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter and teaches communication at Aurora University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Pope Francis' decision to extend priests' ability to forgive abortion in the confessional will have virtually no effect on American Catholics. Yet, given that Catholics still delivered for the Republican Party in the recent presidential election, this gesture from a Pope who has urged mercy for refugees and the poor could be interpreted as saying that abortion -- while still a serious and grave matter -- is not the only issue Catholics should be caring about. The move does not change doctrine about the sinfulness of abortion; it only alters pastoral practice in some parts of the world about how it can be forgiven. Initially intended to apply only during the special \"Year of Mercy,\" which ended Sunday, the practice is being extended indefinitely. The truth is that nearly all priests in the United States and Canada already had the authority to lift the automatic excommunication that comes with procuring an abortion, according to a spokeperson for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who clarified the policy when the Pope first announced it last September. Priests will be able to \"absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion,\" Pope Francis writes in an apostolic letter released by the Vatican on Monday, called \"Misericordia et Misera.\" \"The provision I had made in this regard, limited to the duration of the Extraordinary Holy Year, is hereby extended, notwithstanding anything to the contrary.\"In keeping with the Pope's emphasis on the church as an institution of mercy, this extension to priests worldwide may certainly affect some Catholics' ability to receive the sacraments and be reconciled to the church. It may also result in the church being viewed as more open and accepting, especially in cultures where the church faces \"competition\" from other churches that may be perceived as more welcoming.This move also could be related to the possibility of divorced and remarried Catholics being reconciled to the church through the \"internal forum\" in confession, as opposed to the longer annulment process. But I think the announcement, while certainly timed to the close of the jubilee year and not to the US presidential election, when combined with other statements by Pope Francis, could be read as the pontiff reflecting on some Catholics' decision to vote for Donald Trump. While US Catholics who vote Republican tend to cite anti-abortion beliefs, it's interesting that this Pope seems to talk less about abortion than about poverty.Before the election, on a plane trip home from a visit to Mexico in February, the Pope answered a question about Trump's allegation that the Pope's choice to celebrate Mass in Ciudad Juarez near the border made him \"a political pawn of the Mexican state,\" by saying, \"... a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the gospel.\"At the time, the Pope noted that he would not get involved in telling US Catholics for whom to vote, adding, \"I'll leave the judgment to you, to the people.\"Throughout the campaign, as he has throughout his pontificate, Pope Francis has emphasized the need to respond to the poor and refugees. Just three days before the US election, the Pope urged social justice activists not to give in to the politics of fear. On the eve of the election, he told a journalist he does not \"judge people or politicians,\" but only \"wanted to understand what suffering their behavior causes to the poor and the excluded.\"Last week, after exit polls showed 52% of Catholic voters chose Trump over 45% for Hillary Clinton, Pope Francis seemed to warn against the rise of populist nationalism around the world, noting the danger of an \"epidemic of animosity\" against people of other races or religions. My hunch is that the Pope is concerned about a lack of mercy toward marginalized people all over the world, not just in the United States. \"This is the time of mercy,\" he writes. \"...It is the time of mercy for each and all, since no one can think that he or she is cut off from God's closeness and the power of his tender love. It is the time of mercy because those who are weak and vulnerable, distant and alone, ought to feel the presence of brothers and sisters who can help them in their need. It is the time of mercy because the poor should feel that they are regarded with respect and concern by others who have overcome indifference and discovered what is essential in life. ...\"Of course, the pope's letter on mercy was surely prepared long before the results of the US election. It also should be noted that it also extends the power to forgive in the confessional to the traditionalist and schismatic group, the Society of St. Pius X, so it cannot be read as any sort of advance of \"liberalism\" in the church. Yet, taken together, the Pope's words and actions certainly can give US Catholics much to think about.

{"_id":"It's bowl season: Watch out for the 'surrender cobra'","articleText":"This article originally published in 2015. (CNN)Look around the stands of any stadium during the fourth quarter, and you'll see it.It's the universal signal of anguished defeat, the gesture that shows you've all but given up hope for your team.The \"surrender cobra\" made its debut in popular lexicon in 2013 in Grantland's college football dictionary. It was defined as a \"pose frequently adopted by fans witnessing unfortunate sports happenings, characterized by clasping hands on top of head as though one is under arrest and a slow, tense exhale of breath.\"The Internet embraced it, adopting the #surrendercobra hashtag and launching a Twitter account and other online forums to catalog the most impressive examples. Even coaches and players are susceptible.ESPN celebrated the pose in a video. It featured a beleaguered University of Michigan fan whose perfect surrender cobra during October 2015's Michigan-Michigan State game essentially summed up the game in the eyes of many. His 15 minutes of fame made him the subject of many a meme, earning him the unofficial title of Mr. Surrender Cobra 2015. Sports are ripe for memes -- see \"crying fangirl\" and \"sad Virginia fan\" -- but surrender cobra's beauty is its universality and applicability to observers and participants. Grantland journalist Holly Anderson was high in the stands at the 2009 Sugar Bowl when she first saw the pattern. As No. 6 Utah came out of nowhere to wreck fourth-ranked Alabama, a crimson tide of fans started raising their hands and resting them on their heads.\"I remember thinking they looked like they were all under arrest,\" she said.Fast-forward to 2013, when Anderson was putting together the college football dictionary. She knew she had to include the gesture, but she couldn't come up with a name. Finally, she and a colleague settled on \"surrender cobra.\"\"I liked it the best because it kind of looked like a snake, but but it also looked like you were about to be handcuffed and put in the back of a patrol car,\" she said. The \"surrender\" part makes sense to communication coach Nick Morgan, author of \"Power Cues: The Subtle Science of Leading Groups, Persuading Others and Maximizing Your Personal Impact.\"The idea of surrendering is very much embedded in the action of linking fingers, which signals withdrawal from a situation. It's not an inherently negative gesture, he said. We clasp our fingers against our body when we lay on the beach or next to the pool in a sign of relaxation. It's when we raise our arms that things start to get increasingly emotional. When your arms are resting at your sides, that's the \"coolest emotional signal\" you can send, Morgan said. As you raise your hands, it signals an increase in emotion as you become more engaged, maybe even defensive.At concerts or political rallies, raised hands might signal excitement or exultation. But the combination of clasped fingers on your head imparts an entirely different signal.As a communications coach, Morgan works with executives who frequently deploy the surrender cobra in unproductive meetings as a gesture of handing off the reins -- and not in a good way.\"They're checking out of the situation. They're there, but they're not there anymore,\" he said.Same goes for fans who strike the pose in moments of anguish during a game. They showed up to the game, they cheered and waved pompoms, but now this train wreck is out of their hands. \"It's a good way to describe how a fan feels after they've done everything they can and given it their emotional all,\" Morgan said. \"They're checking out, even though they still love their team.\"With college bowl games and the Super Bowl around the corner, you'll no doubt be seeing more of the surrender cobra -- or falling prey to its power. Which kind of fan will you be?","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/12/18/living/surrender-cobra-feat/index.html"}

While the so-called Mediterranean diet tends to be relatively healthy, some of it's as calorific as it is tasty. Anyone wanting to visit Italy but stay slim might want to avoid the following: Randazzo, Sicily This picturesque medieval town at the foot of Mount Etna has given birth to a divine cult of granita -- a slushy and ice-cream hybrid that Sicilians call their own. The dish traces its origins to Randazzo residents of years past mixing fruit juice with snow from Etna. Yes, it has its imitators, but Sicilian granita is without equal. This is a dense mixture of sugar and water, mixed with locally grown pistachios, toasted almonds and the best seasonal fruit -- mandarin oranges, figs, cactus figs or mulberries.Or, for flavor purists, just lemon or coffee. Tourists eat it like a sandwich, served inside a brioscia con tuppo -- a brioche bun shaped like a ball with a round \"hairpiece\" on top. Locals have their own ritual.They use the brioscia as a spoon. And it's not dessert but lunch.  It melts in the mouth quickly, but has lasting aftereffects.After tasting granita, all other gelati will seem inferior.   Pile it on: Musumeci is an artisan pastry shop.

Milk oozes out when you bite it.Monks started the tradition in the 12th century and it's been handed down from generation to generation.

{"_id":"Italy's 20 regions, dish by delicious dish","articleText":"CNN's Anthony Bourdain heads to Rome Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on \"Parts Unknown.\" (CNN)One reason Sicilians tend to identify with Sicily first and Italy (a distant) second?Sicilian food.The same goes for Veneto in the north or Puglia in the south.Italy is a young country -- it only celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.Despite the successful export of the \"Italian restaurant,\" the idea of a unified Italian cuisine is something many Italians reject.Instead there are regional dishes, sometimes with tastes as different as you'd find between countries.Even the basics differ -- pasta with or without egg, butter in abundance or ditched completely in favor of olive oil.Like reading tea leaves, travelers can discover much about a region's history and landscape from its special sauce.Guaranteed: No mention of spaghetti bolognese.MORE: Italy's best beaches and islands Abruzzo: Lamb with cheese and eggsOne of Italy's most rugged regions, sheep farming predominates in Abruzzo.Meat dishes and cheeses here tend to come from that animal.Agnello cac' e ove (lamb with cheese and eggs) is \"traditionally eaten over the Easter period, since the animal must be young and sheep are born in the spring,\" says Roberto Burdese, president of Slow Food Italia.The sauce, of course, is made only with sheep's milk cheese.Basilicata: Làgane with olive oil and chickpeas  Like its southern neighbors, simplicity is the hallmark of Basilicata's cooking.Away from the coast, you won't often encounter ceci (chickpeas) in northern Italian food. And the pasta (làgane) will be called tagliatelle or pappardelle, and almost certainly made with egg alongside durum wheat flour and water.Here, the làgane is tossed with olive oil, sauteed garlic and cooked ceci. And that's it.Calabria: Macaroni with pork, eggplant and salted ricottaA speciality of Calabrian chef Pasquale Pangallo, this dish merits an entry in \"Cucina Regionale,\" the bible of Italian regional cooking.It combines several of the south's classic elements.MORE: Beyond Rome and Florence: 12 alternative Italian destinationsMelanzane (eggplant) were introduced to Italian cooking by Arabs, regular visitors to, and occasional occupiers of, southern Italy from the ninth to 11th centuries.Calabrian cured meats, such as capocollo (pork neck), are generally spiked with chili pepper, a ubiquitous spice in Calabrian cooking.Ricotta salata (salted ricotta), a dried, pressed sheep's milk cheese, gives the dish a salty kick.Campania: Pizza Napoletana reinventedIn Campania -- Naples above all -- cooking is all about carbs, the white flour of a pizza base in particular.\"The word 'pizza' has wildly varying definitions depending on the sub-region and season,\" explains food journalist Katie Parla. \"It can refer to a savory Easter bread or a pie for one, for example.\"Pizza Napoletana is a thick-rimmed pizza built in a wood-burning domed oven, traditionally topped with cow's milk mozzarella, tomato sauce and another topping or two. Parla points to culinary innovators such as Enzo Coccia at La Notizia (Via Michelangelo da Caravaggio 53, Naples; +39 081 714 2155), Frano Pepe at Pepe in Grani (Vico San Giovanni Battista 3, Caiazzo; +39 082 386 2718) and Francesco and Salvatore Salvo at Pizzeria Salvo (Largo Arso 10-16, San Giorgio a Cremano; +39 081 275 306) among those bringing new flavor and texture combinations to this Campanian classic.Emilia-Romagna: Tortellini with acacia flowersMany pasta dishes we consider \"classic Italian\" have roots in the cooking of Bologna and its region, Emilia-Romagna.Baked, layered lasagna was a Sunday dish for Bolognese families. Cappelletti (stuffed \"little hats\"), tortellini and tortelloni originate from Modena and Reggio Emilia.At the Locanda al Gambero Rosso (Via Verdi 5, Bagno di Romagna; +39 0543 903405), chef Giuliana Saragoni grabs an ingredient from another of the region's traditional dishes, frittelle di acacia (acacia flower fritters), to stuff her fresh tortellini.Friuli Venezia Giulia: Spiced frico cheese and toast Friuli has a hybrid cooking culture, as you might expect from a region at the corner of the Italic, Slavic and Germanic worlds, with a landscape spanning the sea, karst and high Alps. San Daniele cured ham comes from Friuli, as does some of Italy's best white wine.Most closely associated with the Carnia countryside around Udine, frico is based on the local Montasio cow's milk cheese. MORE: World's ugliest monumentsThe mature cheese is cooked, almost to melting point, then spiked with sugar and cinnamon and served either cubed or on toasted bread.The dish is a warming balance of spice, salt and sweetness.Lazio: Spring lamb with salt-cured anchovies Lazio is a region divided by mass tourism. Rome, its capital, welcomes millions of visitors every year. The countryside, on the other hand, is left to itself.Katie Parla, whose app Katie Parla's Rome picks out some of the city's best restaurant and street food spots, says one element captures the essence of Lazio's agricultural roots: abbaccio. \"This young spring lamb reaches its greatest expression when prepared alla cacciatora -- the chopped lamb is cooked in a pan with oil or lard and garlic, sage and rosemary, then seasoned with salt-cured anchovies.\"This savory dish is a reminder of a simpler time when shepherds grazed their flocks across the region and even through central Rome itself.\"Le Marche: Ancona spicy fish stew Ancona's classic dish, brodetto all'anconetana, reflects the city's seafaring heritage. It's a slightly spicy, tomato-based soup/stew made from local catch.\"The dish was originally made on board fishing boats, for lunch,\" explains Paolo Antinori, head chef at Fortino Napoleonico (Via Poggio, Portonovo; +39 071 801450), a restaurant specializing in Le Marche cuisine.\"Cooks used poorer catch, or fish a little broken by the nets and not saleable at the market. Liguria: Chickpea flatbread Many cooking traditions in Liguria -- the small, crescent-shaped region strung out along Italy's northwest coast -- come from the region's seaport, Genoa.  MORE: 10 things Italy does better than anywhere elseAmong them is farinata, a thin, unleavened flatbread made with chickpea flour. Often served as a side or street-food dish, it's traditionally cut into triangular slices and eaten with a dusting of salt, black pepper, rosemary or all of the above.Lombardy: Risotto alla milaneseYou could almost be in China on the flat plains between Turin and Milan. Mile after mile is given over to rice paddies, growing Carnaroli and Arborio varieties of the staple. This is the home of risotto, a carb-loaded primo (first course) whose base is almost always rice and stock.In a risotto alla Milanese, the traditional ingredients are beef marrow (which today is often omitted for dietary reasons) and saffron.Molise: Tripe dumplingsWith a population of less than half a million and fewer tourism sites than its neighbors, Molise is perhaps Italy's least known region to outsiders.As in neighboring Abruzzo, the uneven terrain makes lamb the livestock of choice.In Molise, they eat almost every bit of the creature -- lamb offal is a feature of many traditional dishes.Allulur is a dish of tripe dumplings, encased in the sheep's rumen (part of the stomach) and boiled. At Trattoria da Nonno Cecchino (Italian site only; Via Larino 32, Campobasso; +39 0874 311 778), the tripe is seasoned with garlic, parsley and chili pepper.Piedmont: 'Warm dip'Bagna caôda means \"warm dip\" in Piedmontese, a dialect widely spoken in northwest Italy until recent decades. Preparing the dish is simple: chopped garlic is cooked slowly with oil and butter to form an emulsion. Chefs then pour in a few more cups of olive oil, chopped anchovies and peeled walnuts, and cook it down till it becomes a salty-garlicky bath.READ: 10 of the best Italian restaurants in Rome It's often served with Jerusalem artichoke, endive, sweet pepper and onion for dipping and traditionally brought to the table in a terracotta pot.In Turin, restaurants recognized with the Sapori Torinesi mark specialize in traditional Piedmontese cooking.Puglia: Orecchiette pasta with turnip topsOne of Italy's flattest and most fertile regions, Puglia is the south's breadbasket. Wheat and olive oil are produced in abundance, making it a top Italian region for vegetarians.Orecchiette are \"little ears\" of durum wheat pasta, often made here without egg. This classic Pugliese primo (first course) sees them tossed with cime di rape, broccoli rabe or \"turnip tops,\" a little oil and seasoning, sometimes including preserved anchovies.Sardinia: Pilau\"Fregola [small balls of pasta] is a central element in Sardinian cuisine, which uses durum wheat flour for many baked goods,\" says Burdese of Slow Food Italia.It's also the main ingredient in pilau, a couscous-like dish, prepared like risotto by cooking the grains in a fresh stock.Around the island, you'll find versions of pilau made with sheep or goat meat, or with  crustaceans and shellfish in a tomato sauce.Sicily: Pasta with sardinesPretty much every Mediterranean country that ever had a navy has invaded Sicily at some point in the past 3,000 years.

{"_id":"Italy: Renzi's resignation delayed after meeting with President","articleText":" (CNN)Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella on Monday to offer his resignation. But he was asked to stay until the country's budget is approved.Renzi's offer to resign comes after suffering a crushing referendum defeat Sunday that could transform the country's political and economic landscape.The 41-year-old, who was appointed to office in 2014, arranged to meet with President Sergio Mattarella hours after close to 60% of voters rejected his plans for constitutional reform. As the result reverberated around the country and the continent, the euro fell to a 20-month low against the dollar and dragged Italy toward more financial pain.The prospect of instability in the eurozone's third biggest economy saw the currency drop about 1% against the dollar to around $1.05 in Asia trading. It trimmed those losses later in the day.The decisive outcome, with a 70% turnout, is considered a notable victory for eurosceptic populist and nationalist parties, which campaigned heavily against Renzi and his promise to stimulate Italy's sluggish economy.The 'No' campaign was spearheaded by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement party, led by Beppe Grillo, which is expected to make substantial gains if a general election is called.\"When you lose you cannot pretend that nothing has happened and go to bed and sleep. My government ends here today,\" Renzi said Sunday.Next stepsItaly's path will become clearer as the week progresses. According to Italy's ANSA news agency, the budget law could be approved by Friday. But Renzi's decision to resign brings with it yet more uncertainty. There is the possibility, for example, that a caretaker administration could be appointed to keep the country running until the 2018 elections.That could see the likes of finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan or even Pietro Grasso, the Senate leader, take over as prime minister.And while unlikely, there is also a scenario in which the Italian Parliament is dissolved and a snap election is called. Europe reactsAs Europe awoke to the result, leading figures began to react to the latest installment of political change.Outgoing French President François Hollande paid tribute to Renzi and his attempt to pass \"courageous reforms.\" A statement from the Élysée Palace said that Hollande shared Renzi's will to \"steer Europe to growth and employment.\"In Brussels, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs Pierre Moscovici said he remained convinced the Italian authorities would deal with the situation.\"Italy is a strong country, a reliable country,\" he said, adding that he did not expect an economic crisis.He also insisted the result was not an anti-Europe or an anti-EU vote.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble added that he expected Italy to \"make the best of it,\" while president of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, rejected accusations that the result would radically affect the economic situation within the country.What was it all about?At its core, this vote was a referendum on whether or not Italy should amend its 1948 constitution.Renzi wanted to reduce the power of the Senato, the upper chamber of the Italian Parliament, by slashing its numbers from 315 to 100 -- making it more of a consultative assembly. Proponents of the referendum said that the goal was to make the job of governing Italy less complicated and that the reforms would help revive the nation's lethargic economy.However, critics claimed the reforms would impact the constitution's checks and balances and give the prime minister too much power.Elly Schlein, an Italian member of the European Parliament, said the proposed reforms would have transferred too much power into the hands of the ruling party.\"It was shifting power from the regions to the center in a really unbalanced way,\" she said. \"It was a dangerous reform for the roots of our democratic system.\"However, the referendum was widely considered a litmus test for the rising wave of populism spreading in Europe, and the chance to register discontent with the current government.This, according to Schlein, was Renzi's \"completely unnecessary\" mistake. She said that personalizing and dramatizing the vote meant that many of the people who voted \"No\" -- particularly the younger voters -- did so for political reasons beyond the context of the reform and its consequences.\"The vote was transformed into a vote on himself and his government,\" she said.'A lost opportunity'In Rome, emotions ranged from elation to extreme disappointment.\"I believe this was a lost opportunity for our country,\" Lino Settola, director of a private company, told CNN.\"What interested me was speeding up the process of passing laws and not continuing the ping pong between the House of Representatives and Senate, waiting years before things happen.\"This referendum would have helped speed this process up.\"Giuseppe Cazuolo, a photographer from Rome, was equally concerned by the result. \"What will happen is that the people who have governed Italy will return but nothing will happen,\" he said.\"It's too soon to say who will take power, but everything is in the hands of the President of the Republic now.\"He added, \"I have faith in him, he is a person that Italians love because you can see he is a professional person.\" Another voter, Alex, said that Renzi's mistake was making the referendum too political. He also cited a frustration with Brussels and being governed by EU law as another area that caused political angst.\"I voted no, but I think people want a real change,\" Alex told CNN.\"They don't want just a political change, but a change where things really happen. I think the referendum was too political and Renzi made an error.\"CNN's Hada Messia in Rome, Mark Thompson in London and Jeanne Bonner in Atlanta contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/europe/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi/index.html"}

Rowling has provided a welcome diversion for a seven-year-old girl living in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, sending her eBooks of the entire Harry Potter series. Bana, a young Syrian girl with nearly 100,000 followers on Twitter, says she likes to read, \"to forget the war.\" She regularly posts videos that capture the sound of bombing, appealing for help as the Syrian regime steps up its assault on the besieged city. More than 300 people have been killed in Aleppo's eastern districts since the regime resumed heavy bombardment last week, in what rescuers have called the most intense bombing since the war began.  Bana's mother Fatemah, 26, created a Twitter account for her daughter in late September, as the Syrian army launched a major ground offensive to recapture Aleppo. Fatemah told CNN she started tweeting because she wanted to \"share our life here to the world.'' Fatemah teaches her children -- Mohamed, 5, Noor, 3, and Bana -- at home. She said that the civil war, which began over five years ago, has dramatically impacted their education. A photograph shared to her Twitter account on Thursday shows Mohamed and Noor crowded around Bana like two bookends while she read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"My brothers want to read the Harry Potters too,\" Bana said in a tweet.Earlier this week Fatemah tweeted to J.K. Rowling, saying that her family had watched the Harry Potter film, and that Bana was hoping to read the book.J.K. Rowling replied a few minutes later, writing, \"Bana, I hope you do read the book, because I think you'd like it. Sending you lots and lots of love xxx.\"Soon after Fatemah asked how the family could get a copy of the book, a member of Rowling's team reached out on Twitter to ask if they would be able to read an eBook.  Two days later, Bana tweeted a photo of herself smiling and holding a sign, which read: \"Thank you my friend JK Rowling for the books.\"\"Love you too, Bana! Thinking of you, keep safe #Aleppo,\" Rowling replied.Fatemah told CNN that they are reading the first book in the Harry Potter series \"little by little,\" in between the bombardment.\"It's too early to choose a favorite character,\" Fatemah added. \"Especially today, many bombs distracted her.\"","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/middleeast/j-k-rowling-sends-syrian-girl-harry-potter-books/index.html"}

{"_id":"Japan tsunami triggers rare tidal waves ","articleText":" (CNN)The strong earthquake and resulting tsunami in eastern Japan Monday did not result in significant damage or casualties, but it did produce an interesting and rare phenomenon known as a \"tidal bore.\" Videos of the tidal bore have been showing up all over news sites and social media, purporting to be the tsunami itself -- but what is actually causing the slow-moving waves to surge through the rivers, channels, and canals?According to Andy Newman, an associate professor and geophysicist at Georgia Tech, \"a tsunami acts much like a tide (hence the old name 'tidal wave'), which can contain significant tidal bore structures.\" Tsunamis used to be referred to as tidal waves, which is incorrect since they are not associated with the actual tides, but rather from earthquakes or other earth movements like landslides. Tidal bores are waves that are formed by the extreme funneling of an incoming ocean tide into a long, narrow inlet or channel.  The force of the incoming water is focused into the smaller area and pushes against the normal flow of the channel, forming the slow-moving wave that pushes upstream.There are several locations on Earth that, as result of the local geography, experience large tidal bores, such as the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the Severn River in England and Qiantang River in eastern China (known as the Silver Dragon). During exceptionally large tides -- such as those that occur during full moons -- the tidal bores can be a visual marvel that draw large crowds and even surfers.  Though tidal bores forced from tsunamis are not nearly as dangerous as the actual tsunami arrival on the coastline, they can have some farther reaching impacts inland. The waves from the tidal bore can travel many miles inland, Newman said, and \"could catch individuals upstream that are unsuspecting and cause damage to piers in the river.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/world/japan-tsunami-tidal-bore/index.html"}
{"_id":"Japan's Abe on US mission to 'build trust' with Donald Trump","articleText":" (CNN)[Breaking news update, published at 07:44 p.m. ET]Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday he had a \"very candid discussion\" with President-elect Donald Trump, during a brief press availability following their in-person meeting.Abe declined to explain in detail what he discussed with Trump because the visit was \"unofficial\" as Trump has not yet assumed the presidency, but he stressed that he emerged feeling that the US and Japan will be able to maintain \"a relationship of trust\" with Trump as president.The meeting was Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state since he clinched the presidency last week and comes after Trump has repeatedly suggested Japan should shoulder a bigger financial burden of the US's military forces in the region.Abe declined to say if the two men hashed out the defense issue or discussed their disagreement over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but stressed that he emerged \"convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have confidence.\"[Original story, published at 12:39 p.m. ET]Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he wanted to \"build trust\" with US President-elect Donald Trump ahead of their meeting in New York Thursday as he seeks to safeguard the long-standing alliance between the two countries. \"I am very honored to see the President elect ahead of other world leaders,\" Abe told reporters before his departure.\"The Japan-US alliance is the axis of Japan's diplomacy and security. The alliance becomes alive only when there is trust between us. I would like to build such a trust with Mr Trump.\" READ: What does Donald Trump mean for Asia?Like other Asian leaders, Abe was keen to discover how much of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric will become policy, in particular whether Trump will follow through on a suggestion he might withdraw US troops from the region. A top aide to Abe, Katsuyuki Kawai, said that he'd been told by members of Trump's transition team that Trump's previous remarks should not be taken literally. Does Trump mean what he said?It's not hard to see why Abe wanted to get first word with Trump.The Japanese government was concerned by remarks made by Trump during his campaign about relations between the two countries. In particular, officials were rattled by Trump's suggestions that Japan, which until last year had a pacifist constitution, should obtain nuclear weapons to protect itself from North Korea.\"Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea,\" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper in March.At the time, Abe said that \"whoever will become the next president of the United States, the Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy.\"A special adviser sent in advance by Abe to meet with members of Trump's transition team said he was told Japan shouldn't take Trump's campaign talk literally.\"All the people shared the same opinion — that we don't need to be nervous about every single word and phrase said during Mr Trump's campaign,\" Katsuyuki Kawai told Japanese broadcaster NHK.Not following protocolThe President-elect and his team have not followed what is considered normal protocol in Washington D.C. His transition team has yet to contact the Pentagon, State Department or other federal agencies. It is also unclear in what order he has spoken with world leaders. A list issued Wednesday by his transition team details who he and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken to but didn't give further details.Starting from scratch?Tomohiko Taniguchi, the Prime Minister's special adviser, said that Abe suggested the meeting during his congratulatory call to Trump on November 10. Eager \"to grab the chance\" to meet the President-elect, Abe decided to change his route to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, to include a stopover in New York. \"He will have to work with Trump for the next four years,\" Taniguchi told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. \"This will be good opportunity for them to get to know each other well.\"Reports suggest that Abe is starting from scratch in building his relationship with Trump.The Nikkei Asian Review reported last week that Abe had not been preparing for a Trump victory, and when he visited the US in September, he only met Hillary Clinton.Taniguchi told CNN that the US commitment in Japan is about more than relations between the two nations, it's about a commitment to the broader Indo-Pacific region.\"As long as the US commits itself to this region, what matters is location,\" he said. \"And Japan can offer the best location in the region.\"American isolationism?Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, suggested that much of Trump's tough talk on Asia talk might be bluster. \"Much of the world seems convinced that Trump's election signals the ushering in of a period of American isolationism in which Washington will retreat from the world, including from Asia, and abandon its allies,\" said Haenle, who served on the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. \"Yet, the statements that have emerged over the last several days from Trump's advisers indicate something very different -- that Trump will implement a robust a US military presence in Asia, provide strong support for Taiwan, and bolster US alliances.\" Abe will also want to know how Trump plans to approach North Korea, which has ramped up its testing of missiles this year, including a nuclear warhead.Trump has said he would be happy to host the country's dictator, Kim Jong Un, for a visit.\"Japan is the closest US ally in Asia and he'll want this to be reaffirmed,\" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.\"I think Abe understands that Trump is a brittle person who takes offense easily and he will want to set a positive tone. He didn't have good chemistry with Obama,\" said Kingston.CNN's Juliet Perry contributed to this report.

Most live largely under Israeli military rule, and do not vote in Israel's national elections.\"Carter is one of Israel's most vocal American critics.

However, President-elect Donald Trump's position has thrilled many supporters of Israel, as well as Israel's political right wing. As a candidate, Trump promised to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel and renogotiate the Iran nuclear deal, which has been criticized by Israel's leaders. The leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party Naftali Bennett, claimed a Trump presidency allows Israel to fully dismiss the notion of a Palestinian state. \"This is the position of the President-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple.

The Labour MP was stabbed and shot by Mair, days before Britain voted on whether to remain in the European Union -- Cox, 41, was a prominent supporter of the \"Remain\" campaign.When he first appeared in court, Mair shouted \"my name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\" He declined to take the stand during his trial at the Old Bailey in London.The judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, sentenced Mair to a whole-life term. \"You are no patriot,\" he told Mair. \"By your actions, you have betrayed the quintessence of our country, its adherence to parliamentary democracy.\"Sue Hemming, Head of Special Crime and Counter Terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said Mair's premeditated crimes were \"motivated by hate ... nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology.\"READ MORE: Who was Jo Cox?Nazi memorabiliaSeen as a rising star of British politics and respected across the political spectrum, Cox, who had two children, campaigned to keep the UK in the EU, celebrated diversity, championed the rights of immigrants and was an advocate of women's and children's issues.The court heard that Mair, a Nazi sympathizer, stabbed her, shot her once in the head and once in the chest with a rifle and then stabbed her again with a dagger.His victim cried out: \"Let him hurt me, don't let him hurt you,\" and despite the efforts of a bystander and paramedics she died later, according to news agency CourtNewsUK.At his home at Lowood Lane in Birstall, police found an extensive collection of Nazi memorabilia and books, a dossier on Cox; and at his local library they found evidence of Internet searches for extreme right wing material and the gun he planned to use, the agency reported.No evidence was offered on his behalf, and his barrister Russell Flint QC made only a very short speech saying Mair's fate was in the hands of the jury, the agency said.READ MORE: Murder suspect gives name as 'death to traitors'Politician a 'bright star'Cox's death drew tributes from all sides, with the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron telling lawmakers: \"She had a huge heart. She was a very compassionate, caring MP. She was a bright star -- no doubt about it.\" He also praised her \"great track record of caring about refugees.\"Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, added: \"We have lost one of our own and our society as a whole has lost one of our very best. Jo Cox didn't just believe in loving her neighbor, she believed in loving her neighbor's neighbor.\"After the verdict was announced, Corbyn posted on Twitter: \"The single biggest tribute we can pay to Jo Cox will be to confront those who wish to promote the hatred and division that led to her murder.\"Her husband Brendan said Cox \"lit up our lives\" and called for unity to ensure that \"those ... who seek to divide us will face an unassailable wall of British tolerance.\"Before the trial, the widower said Cox had become increasingly worried that politics was getting more extreme and \"too tribal.\"\"She had strong political views and I believe she was killed because of those views,\" he said. Cox was elected to the British Parliament in May 2015 and in her maiden speech spoke of how British communities had been enhanced by immigration.\"While we celebrate our diversity, what surprises me time and time again as I travel around the constituency is that we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us,\" she told fellow lawmakers.READ MORE: Heartbreak, anger in Jo Cox's hometown'Brave eye witnesses'Cox was killed by Mair outside a meeting with her constituents in Birstall, West Yorkshire. At an earlier hearing, prosecutor David Cawthorne said Mair also stabbed 78-year-old passer-by Bernard Carter-Kenny who scrambled out of his vehicle to help the MP. He suffered a serious abdomen injury.Carter-Kenny was too ill to attend the Old Bailey to give evidence, but told the court in a statement that he tried to jump on Mair's back and \"take him down,\" according to CourtNewsUK.The court heard that unarmed police officers tackled Mair, who told them: \"It's me. I'm a political activist,\" the agency said.Sue Hemming, speaking on behalf of the CPS, praised the actions of \"several people [who] courageously intervened to try and save Ms Cox,\" and of the \"brave eye witnesses\" who spoke out at the trial.READ MORE: Killing of politician shocks BritainWhite supremacist linksAfter the attack, one of Mair's neighbors, Diana Peters, told CNN that the assailant was \"meek and mild\" but though helpful \"kept himself to himself.\"But the US-based Southern Poverty Law Center published what it said were documents showing that he had a history of purchasing material from the National Alliance -- a white supremacist organization based in the US -- and had a subscription to one of its magazines.He also subscribed to a pro-apartheid group's magazine in the 1980s, the magazine's editor told CNN.READ MORE: Who is Thomas Mair?Mair was handed a whole life sentence, which means he can only ever be released upon the orders of the UK Home Secretary.Judge scathing in his summaryIn his sentencing remarks, the judge, Justice Wilkie, called Cox a patriot and praised her selfless concern for others -- describing her as passionate, openhearted, inclusive and generous.He told Mair: \"You are no patriot.

{"_id":"Joe Biden is leaving the White House, but will he have a new home at DNC?","articleText":" (CNN)From VP to DNC? Vice President Joe Biden's possible role leading the Democratic Party, potential conflicts of interest for Donald Trump as commander in chief, and the GOP's \"Kumbaya\" moment with the incoming leader and how long it will last. It's all in the \"Inside Politics\" forecast -- where you get a taste of tomorrow's news today.1) Revamping the Democratic Party... with Uncle Joe?It was the post-election narrative almost no one saw coming: The Democrats are picking up the pieces and considering revamping the party. Their goal is to win back those voters who went Trump's way. As The New York Times' Maggie Haberman reports, one name that's been floated as a possible Democratic National Committee chair: Biden, the outgoing vice president. \"There are a lot of people who think that he would be the sort of perfect voice toward the white working-class voters who the party is looking to attract,\" Haberman said. \"There's been no indication that this is what Biden wants, but it is something that is being talked about right now.\"2) Possible conflicts of interest for incoming commander in chief?The President-elect has agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits dealing with Trump University. But will this case be the first of many possible corporate wrenches thrown into Trump's White House? Trump University isn't the only possible hiccup, according to Errol Louis, host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1 news channel.\"40 Wall St., which is by far the most successful of the real estate deals that still has Trump's name on it, was the place where Trump University was headquartered,\" Louis said. \"But there are also a couple of dozen other places where prosecutors have either convicted or investigated various people,\" he said, referring to investigations of alleged scams tied to the Manhattan skyscraper.\". ... It raises an interesting kind of conflict. Can the sitting president be earning money from people who his same federal government is supposed to be investigating, prosecuting, pursuing and in some cases prosecuting and imprisoning?\"3) How long will that GOP 'Kumbaya' moment last? Republicans on the Hill are all smiles right now as they wait for their incoming leader. But behind the scenes, they are also trying to determine what type of president  Trump will be legislatively. As Caitlin Huey-Burns of RealClear Politics puts it: \"They don't really know him that well.\" Huey-Burns said, \"They are still at odds (when it comes to) a lot of significant policy issues that are going to come out, perhaps, right off the gate. \"Government spending, when it comes to infrastructure projects, foreign policy, when it comes to Russia, and touching entitlements and those sorts of things; we'll be watching how Republicans navigate this new Trump world.\"4) What Trump tweets say about how he'll be as President We all know the President-elect likes to tweet. In his recent appearance on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" he called it \"tremendous\" and a \"modern form of communication.\"But as Philip Bump of The Washington Post notes, how Trump tweets may say a lot about how he'll transition from candidate to commander in chief. Bump said he'll be watching. \"The way he interacts with the media, the way he keeps floating various rumors about his Cabinet picks, the way he gets into weird fights on Twitter continually, even as President-elect ...,\" Bump said.\"I think it's going to be interesting to watch this transitional period, how he uses social media, how he uses rumors, as an indicator of how he'll actually be once he's President.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/ip-forecast-joe-biden-possible-dnc-chair/index.html"}

John McCain said he's still done with questions about President-elect Donald Trump.McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was asked by CNN's Manu Raju about Trump's tweet about flag burning.\"I have not been commenting on Mr. Trump and I will continue not to comment on Mr. Trump,\" McCain told Raju.

{"_id":"Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $1 billion settlement","articleText":" (CNN)A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements.A lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered \"serious medical complications caused by defective\" metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product. Each of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants. The jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product's effectiveness to patients and their doctors. \"Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we've known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,\" said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. \"This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.\"Both Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal.\"We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,\" said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. \"DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.\"This is the third bellwether -- or test -- trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies. In March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week's ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law.  Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling. In the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies. A fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/health/johnson-and-johnson-depuy-hip-implants/index.html"}

Catch the series online here. (CNN)On a misty Italian morning, we crunch our way through green-yellow undergrowth as Pepe the dog darts on ahead, nose close to the sandy soil. His tail twitches as he catches the scent. Looking first to his owner, he jabs with his paws, earth shooting into the air as he gets closer to the prize. I'm in the Tuscan town of San Miniato for the November \"gold rush,\" when the Italian white truffle comes into season. This rare white fungus is as fabled as Moby Dick, and just as elusive. That truffle emotion \"The truffle is an emotion. It's not a product, it's not a taste,\" explains my guide Massimo Cucchiara, who's from a family of truffle hunters that reaches back three generations. \"It's an emotion when you find it. It's an emotion when you eat it. I still remember my first truffle like I remember my first kiss.\"Massimo's garlicky scented mistress grows underground, close to the roots of oak, hazel, poplar and beech trees, and is only found in a handful of places around the world. It's this rarity that makes it so prized. Truffles are one of the world's most expensive foods and the Italian white is the most valuable of all, with a market price of up to €4,000 ($4,400) per kilo. Like that heady first embrace, it's impossible to reproduce. \"It's nature that decides it,\" he explains. \"We can't cultivate the truffle.\"The San Miniato Hills, with their mild Tuscan climate and soil rich in mineral salts, are the perfect breeding ground for top-quality truffles -- as well as the wine and olive oil for which the region is famous. Beware of impostersThe rarity and expense of the true white truffle means imposters are rife. Chances are, if you've tasted white truffle you've been eating chemically enhanced tuber borchii -- an inferior Italian truffle similar in appearance but incomparable in taste. The second-rate truffle is sprayed with a harsh artificial aroma that mimics the smell and taste. \"When I go into the restaurant and I get that smell I don't eat the truffle dish,\" says Massimo. As for truffle oil -- most commercial oils are synthetic gloop unworthy of washing Pepe's paws. \"When you eat the pasta with the truffle oil you don't taste it with your mouth, you taste it with your nose.\"The gentle, earthy taste of Italian white truffle is too subtle to be preserved in oil or cheese or meat. Striking gold Massimo's father, Salvatore, kneels down to unearth our first find of the day, brushing at the soil with his fingers with all the care of an archeologist on a dig. It's a 25-gram golden-brown beauty, worth up to $100. Its firm texture, umber hue and marbled white-brown interior revealed along a nibbled edge all point to its freshness and ripeness. Then there's the gentle, earthy musk, which builds as it warms in the hand.When eaten, \"the taste is delicate in your mouth,\" says Massimo. \"The smell though, you could smell for days.\"Dogs, not pigs Hunters guess at where the year's harvest might be found by judging the weather, the earth and the plants.But most of all, they rely on their dogs -- rather than the pigs of legend. \"It's the dog that teaches you,\" says Massimo. \"Every day you have a new lesson.\" Pigs might have the sensitive snouts required for the job, but their use is banned in Italy because their overeager rooting damages the truffles' delicate mycelia, the spore-holding web necessary for the fungi's reproduction. Also, it's pretty dangerous to get between a 300-kilogram pig and a truffle it's determined to eat. A particular set of skills Pepe, our dog for today, is a mix of springer spaniel, Segugio Italiano and setter.  Like his owners, Pepe is from a long line of hunters. His is a hardy mongrel combination that ensures energy, stamina and a keen sense of smell. While Massimo and I talk, Salvatore and Pepe walk ahead, communicating in a private language built up over nine years of working together.\"It's important to know your dog, have empathy,\" explains Massimo. \"You can speak about everything. After a while you speak about your problems!\"Ancient pilgrim routeSan Miniato is a quietly beautiful medieval hill town, centered around a tower fortress that commands views over the Arno Valley, with its cypress and olive trees. The forest, wineries, and tiny villages of the San Miniato hills lie to the south, while to the north is busy industry. Santa Croce sull'Arno is the heartland of Italian leather manufacturing. An ideally positioned base for exploring the cities of Florence, Pisa, Siena and Lucca, San Miniato is on the ancient Via Francigena pilgrim route that stretches from Canterbury, England, down to Rome. Today's pilgrims come for the annual truffle festival held here during the last three weekends in November, when the normally sleepy town fills with life. Honored with statues, lamented with funerals Here, truffles are honored with statues. There's a bronze tribute in the town center to the world's largest truffle, a two-kilogram beast found in San Miniato in 1954. Funeral processions are held for them. In 2004, a $52,000 truffle was at the center of a media storm after being bought by a London restaurant. When the truffle spoiled after being incorrectly stored, its remains were brought back to San Miniato for a lavish homecoming lament. A lesson, then, in the importance of knowing how to care for and prepare the truffle. Continuing our journey from earth to plate, we visit Italian TV chef Gilberto Rossi at his restaurant Pepenero, for a masterclass. How to prepare the white truffle\"We never cook the white truffle,\" explains Gilberto, as he takes white truffle butter out of the fridge, ready to make tagliolini al tartufo. The butter is made by mixing it with leftover truffle shavings and leaving it for a week for the flavor to take hold. Brash oils have no place here. Butter, egg or mascarpone are the only suitors gentle enough to marry with the white truffle.\"If you don't know how to use the truffle, you kill the taste in a few minutes,\" adds Massimo.Simplicity is key. While the fresh tagliolini is dropped in boiling water, the eggs and butter are mixed to create a creamy base for the pasta. Gilberto serves the pasta, swirling the strands around the spoon, then shaves about eight grams of San Miniato white truffle on top.We eat it with L'Erede white sparkling wine from local winery Ivana Cupelli. A typical Tuscan Chianti would risk overwhelming the dish. \"Sometimes it doesn't work when you mix two diamonds,\" says Massimo. And the taste? Hail to Gilberto, Massimo and all followers of the one true truffle. As someone only previously acquainted with mid-range truffle oils, it's an awakening. The next day at the San Miniato Truffle Festival, I eat two dishes prepared by volunteers from the local Truffle Association, served on plastic tableware inside a marquee.They couldn't have tasted better if they'd been served on gold platters by diamante unicorns. First, carpaccio of Tuscan Chianina beef, seasoned with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and served with valeriana salad, pine nuts and shavings of white truffle and Parmesan. On the side, white bread spread with soft mascarpone cheese and topped with a sliver of truffle.And then for seconds -- because there always should be seconds -- there's silky, creamy risotto, flavored with broth and seasoned with salt and pepper, and crowned with generous flakes of Tuscan gold. Truffle seasons White truffle season lasts from October to late December or early January. A truffle can be stored, wrapped in paper in the fridge, but only for up to 10 days. So when they're gone, they're gone. In the meantime, there's the Italian black winter truffle, in season from December to March, and the black summer truffle, found from May to September. \"We go hunting all year,\" says Massimo. The truffles change, and the dogs change -- Pepe turns his nose up at black truffles, so one of his siblings will step in.But the hunt goes on.

{"_id":"Journalism faces an 'existential crisis' in Trump era","articleText":"CNN's chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour has been awarded the Committee to Project Journalists' Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for \"extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom.\" This is a transcript of the speech she gave after accepting the honor Tuesday night in New York.New York (CNN)I never in a million years thought I would be up here on stage appealing for the freedom and safety of American journalists at home.Ladies and gentlemen, I added the bits from candidate Trump as a reminder of the peril we face. I actually hoped that once President-elect, all that that would change, and I still do. But I was chilled when the first tweet after the election was about \"professional protesters incited by the media.\"He walked back the part about the protesters but not the part about the media.We're not there. But postcard from the world: This is how it goes with authoritarians like Sisi, Erdoğan, Putin, the Ayatollahs, Duterte, et al.As all the international journalists we honor in this room tonight and every year know only too well: First the media is accused of inciting, then sympathizing, then associating -- until they suddenly find themselves accused of being full-fledged terrorists and subversives. Then they end up in handcuffs, in cages, in kangaroo courts, in prison -- and then who knows?Just to say, Erdoğan has just told my Israeli colleague Ilana Dayan that he cannot understand why anyone's protesting in America, it must mean they don't accept -- or understand -- democracy! And he thinks America like all great countries needs a strongman to get things done!Top journalists warn on press freedom'An appeal to protect journalism'A great America requires a great and free and safe press. So this above all is an appeal to protect journalism itself. Recommit to robust fact-based reporting without fear nor favor -- on the issues. Don't stand for being labeled crooked or lying or failing. Do stand up together -- for divided we will all fall.The historian Simon Schama, in the house tonight, told me early on that this was not just another election, and we cannot treat it as one.And he says if ever there's a time to celebrate, honor, protect and mobilize for press freedom and basic good journalism, it's now.At the start of this campaign, a network news president said this phenomenon may not be good for America but damn good for us.During an interview on my program this summer, the filmmaker and historian Ken Burns asked me what would Edward R. Murrow do?First, like many people watching where I was overseas, I admit I was shocked by the exceptionally high bar put before one candidate and the exceptionally low bar put before the other candidate.It appeared much of the media got itself into knots trying to differentiate between balance, objectivity, neutrality, and crucially, truth.We cannot continue the old paradigm -- let's say like over global warming -- where 99.9% of the empirical scientific evidence is given equal play with the tiny minority of deniers.I learned long ago, covering the ethnic cleansing and genocide in Bosnia, never to equate victim with aggressor, never to create a false moral or factual equivalence, because then you are an accomplice to the most unspeakable crimes and consequences.'Stop banalizing the truth'I believe in being truthful, not neutral. And I believe we must stop banalizing the truth.And we have to be prepared to fight especially hard for the truth in a world where the Oxford English Dictionary just announced its word of 2016: \"post-truth.\"We have to accept that we've had our lunch handed to us by the very same social media that we've so slavishly been devoted to.The winning candidate did a savvy end run around us and used it to go straight to the people. Combined with the most incredible development ever -- the tsunami of fake news sites -- aka lies -- that somehow people could not, would not, recognize, fact check, or disregard.One of the main writers of these false articles -- these lies -- says people are getting dumber, just passing fake reports around, without fact checking. We need to ask whether technology has finally outpaced our human ability to keep up. Facebook needs to step up. Advertisers need to boycott the lying sites.Are journalists facing an 'existential crisis?'Wael Ghonim, one of the fathers of the Arab spring, dubbed the social media revolution, now says:\"The same medium that so effectively transmits a howling message of change also appears to undermine the ability to make it. Social media amplifies the human tendency to bind with one's own kind. It tends to reduce complex social challenges to mobilizing slogans that reverberate in echo chambers of the like-minded rather than engage in persuasion, dialogue, and the reach for consensus. Hate speech and untruths appear alongside good intentions and truths.\"I feel that we face an existential crisis, a threat to the very relevance and usefulness of our profession.Now, more than ever, we need to commit to real reporting across a real nation, a real world in which journalism and democracy are in mortal peril, including by foreign powers like Russia paying to churn out and place false news, and hacking into democratic systems here and allegedly in upcoming crucial German and French elections too.A quick anecdote from out there: In the 1997 Iranian elections, the reform candidate won and the establishment ayatollahs were caught totally off guard. One of them asked me later how I was so sure and when did I know that Khatami was going to win. I told him, as soon as I got on the ground and started talking to people! Just saying.Fighting against a 'post-values world'We must also fight against a post-values world.And let me hit back at this elitist backlash we're all bending over backwards to accommodate.Since when were American values elitist values? They are not left or right values. They are not rich or poor values, not the forgotten-man values.Like many foreigners I have learned they are universal. They are the values of every American from the humblest to the most exalted. They form the very fundamental foundation of the United States and are the basis of America's global leadership. They are brand America. They are America's greatest export and gift to the world.So yes, like so many around the world, I was shocked -- very few ever imagined that so many Americans conducting their sacred duty in the sanctity of the voting booth, with their secret ballot, would be angry enough to ignore the wholesale vulgarity of language, the sexual predatory behavior, the deep misogyny, the bigoted and insulting views.Gov. Mario Cuomo said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Perhaps the opposite will be true this time around.If not, I will fight as a journalist -- as we all must -- to defend and protect the unique value system that makes these United States -- and with which it seeks to influence the world.'We must fight against normalization of the unacceptable'The conservative radio host who may be the next white house press secretary says mainstream media is hostile to traditional values.I would say it's just the opposite. And have you read about the \"heil, victory\" meeting in Washington, DC this past weekend? Why aren't there more stories about the dangerous rise of the far right here and in Europe? Since when did anti-Semitism stop being a litmus test in this country?We must fight against normalization of the unacceptable.A week before the heated Brexit referendum in the UK, the gorgeous, young, optimistic, idealistic, compassionate MP Jo Cox, a remainer, was shot and stabbed to death by a maniac yelling \"Britain first.\" She was particularly sensitive to the plight of Syrian war refugees.At his trial, the court was told the accused had researched information on the SS and the KKK.Just a few weeks ago, her husband, Brendan, now raising their two tiny toddlers, expanded for me on an op-ed he'd written:\"Political leaders and people generally must embrace the responsibility to speak out against bigotry. Unless the center holds against the insidious creep of extremism, history shows how quickly hatred is normalized. What begins with biting your tongue for political expediency, or out of social awkwardness, soon becomes complicity with something far worse. Before you know it, it's already too late.\"  So now the solutions!!The media's role in the world","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/opinions/christiane-amanpour-journalism-in-trump-era/index.html"}
{"_id":"Jury finds Justin Ross Harris guilty of murder in son's hot car death","articleText":"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN)A jury in Georgia on Monday found Justin Ross Harris guilty of murder in the 2014 death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Harris, 35, was accused of intentionally locking Cooper inside a hot car for seven hours. On that same day, Harris was sexting with six women, including one minor, according to phone records. In addition to three counts of murder, Harris was found guilty of two counts of cruelty to children for Cooper's death, and guilty of three counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material with two underage girls.\"This is one of those occasions where actions speak louder than words,\" Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring said after the verdict. \"He has malice in his heart, absolutely.\"The incidentThe trial, which spanned almost five weeks, was moved to the Georgia coastal town of Brunswick from Cobb County, outside Atlanta, after intense pretrial publicity. It was briefly interrupted by Hurricane Matthew. The Glynn County jury of six men and six women deliberated for 21 hours over four days. Jurors considered the testimony of 70 witnesses and 1,150  pieces of evidence, including the Hyundai Tucson in which Cooper died in a suburban Atlanta parking lot. Harris showed little reaction as the verdict was read in court.Cobb County prosecutors argued that Harris intentionally locked Cooper inside his car on a hot summer 2014 day because he wanted to be free of his family responsibilities. Harris' lawyers claimed the boy's death was a tragic accident brought about by a lapse in memory.   It was June 18, 2014, when Harris, then 33, strapped his son into a rear-facing car seat and drove from their Marietta, Georgia, home to Chick-fil-A for breakfast, then to The Home Depot corporate headquarters, where he worked. Instead of dropping Cooper off at day care, testimony revealed Harris left him in the car all day while he was at work.Sometime after 4 p.m. that day, as Harris drove to a nearby theater to see a movie, he noticed his son was still in the car. He pulled into a shopping center parking lot and pulled Cooper's lifeless body from the SUV. Witnesses said he appeared distraught and was screaming.\"'I love my son and all, but we both need escapes.' Those words were uttered 10 minutes before this defendant, with a selfish abandon and malignant heart, did exactly that,\" said Boring in his closing argument.Hot car deaths: How can parents forget a child in a car?The evidenceThe prosecution argued that Harris could see his son sitting in his car seat in the SUV.\"If this child was visible in that car that is not a failure in memory systems,\" Boring argued. \"Cooper would have been visible to anyone inside that car. Flat out.\" If Cooper was visible, Boring said, \"the defendant is guilty of all counts.\"After the verdict, jurors told the prosecution that the evidence weighed heavily in their decision, Boring said.Day by Day: Key moments from the Justin Ross Harris trialDigital evidence showed that on the day his son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with six women, including one minor. State witnesses testified that Harris lived what prosecutors described as a \"double life.\" To his wife, family, friends and co-workers, Harris was seen as a loving father and husband. But unbeknownst to them, Harris engaged in online sexual communication with multiple women, including two underage girls, had extramarital sexual encounters in public places and paid for sex with a prostitute. Harris' defense maintained that his sexual behavior had nothing to do with Cooper's death.\"The state wants to bury him in this filth and dirt of his own making, so that you will believe he is so immoral, he is so reprehensible that he can do exactly this,\" said defense attorney H. Maddox Kilgore during his closing argument. Kilgore argued that Cobb County police investigators focused only on matters that fit the state's theory and ignored all the evidence that pointed to an accident.  \"You have been misled throughout this trial,\" Kilgore told jurors. The defense lawyer continued to maintain his client's innocence after the verdict. He said he plans to appeal the verdict.\"When an innocent person is convicted there's been some breakdowns in the system and that's what happened here,\" Kilgore told reporters outside the courthouse.\"From the moment we met Ross Harris we've never, ever once wavered in our absolute belief that he is not guilty of what he's just been convicted of.\"The main defense witness: Harris' ex-wife The defense's key witness was Harris' ex-wife and Cooper's mother, Leanna Taylor. \"Cooper was the sweetest little boy. He had so much life in him. He was everything to me,\" Taylor recalled, as she seemed to fight through tears. For two days, Taylor told jurors private details of her married life with Harris, saying they had intimacy problems and recounting Harris' struggles with pornography. The Justin Ross Harris case: What you need to knowMarital struggles aside, Taylor described Harris as a \"very involved\" parent who loved their son. In her mind, she said, the only possible explanation was that Harris \"forgot\" Cooper and accidentally left him in the car. Boring said it did not matter that Taylor declined to speak with the prosecutor's office and testified for the defense. \"As far as proving the case we did not need her,\" he told CNN.Harris is expected to be sentenced December 5. He could face life without parole, though Boring said the prosecution will speak with the family to determine what kind of sentence to ask for.

{"_id":"Keeping kids safe from hazardous toys during the holidays","articleText":" (CNN)Toy injuries resulted in 185,000 visits to the emergency room and 11 deaths among children under the age of 15 in 2015, according to a report (PDF) released Thursday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Cuts and bruises were the most common injuries, and the head and the face were the most affected areas of the body. Riding toys, specifically non-motorized scooters, were responsible for 45% of the toy-related deaths.The report comes just in time for the holiday shopping season. \"We want consumers to enjoy their time, with holiday gifts being a source of joy rather than a source of pain,\" Consumer Product Safety Commission spokeswoman Nikki Fleming said.The safety commission and US Customs and Border Protection say they want to keep hazardous toys out of kids' hands and create a safer marketplace for consumers. They work together to find and detain shipments of toys and other children's products that fail to meet federal safety standards. They also work with counterpart organizations abroad to ensure safety standards are being met. More than 8 million hazardous units have been stopped over the past four years, according to the agencies.Toys are also recalled for defects that could cause choking or pose any risk of mechanical hazards, fire hazards or injuries to a child.  The number of toy recalls has declined from 172 in 2008 to 24 so far in 2016 in part because of stricter standards and enforcement. Consumers can also contribute to children's safety, Fleming said. \"We want consumers to take safety precautions to avoid ending up in an emergency room this holiday.\" \"What is really important is for everyone to understand you can't be safe 100% the time,\" said Dr. Kristin Harkin, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Be a good label reader and choose age-appropriate toys. \"Making sure the age is appropriate is really key. I've seen toys going to unexpected places: up one's nose, in ears,\" Harkin said.  Include safety gear when you buy riding toys.Use toys in the right environment. \"A ball in the living room is probably not the right environment, as opposed to a playroom,\" said Harkin.Watch out for hidden dangers such as balloons. Keep deflated balloons away from children younger than 8, and discard torn balloons. \"They can put them in their mouth, which would cause them to choke,\" Fleming said.Beware of batteries. Battery charging should always be supervised by adults because chargers and adapters can burn. Harkin warned that small batteries are especially dangerous. \"Infants and toddlers may consume them. They're the size of an M&M, so it will be very easy for children to confuse them with candies,\" she said.Pay close attention to instructions. \"If a toy is not properly constructed, before someone has a moment to enjoy it, often something unexpected occurs,\" Harkin said.Stay informed on toy recalls. \"Check your existing toys to see if they have been recalled or broken,\" Fleming said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/toy-injury-report/index.html"}
{"_id":"Keith Lamont Scott killing: No charges against officer, DA says ","articleText":"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN)The officer who fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott won't face charges, a prosecutor said Wednesday, closing a two-month investigation into the killing that led to heated protests and divided the city of Charlotte. Mecklenburg County District Attorney Andrew Murray said he didn't reach the decision alone; a total of 15 prosecutors unanimously agreed that Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Officer Brentley Vinson was justified in shooting Scott on September 20 in an apartment complex parking lot. In his hourlong announcement, Murray rejected a series of \"erroneous claims\" made shortly after the shooting. He said those narratives fueled widespread misconceptions about what actually happened. Among them: -- Scott's relatives said he didn't have a gun, but \"all the credible evidence\" led to the conclusion that Scott was armed, Murray said. He said Scott's DNA was on the grip of a gun found at the scene. Murray also said at least three officers reported seeing Scott holding a gun before he was shot, though dashcam video did not show that detail. -- Shortly before the shooting, Scott visited a local convenience store. There, surveillance video showed a bulge around Scott's ankle that was consistent with the holster and gun later described by officers, Murray said. -- One woman initially said a white officer killed Scott at the apartment complex -- a narrative later echoed by protesters. But that woman later told investigators she didn't actually see the shooting, Murray said. Murray said Vinson, who is black, was the only officer who shot Scott. He said an analysis of the other officers' guns showed those guns were fully loaded, while Vinson's gun was missing several bullets. -- After the shooting, Scott's daughter posted a video on Facebook Live saying her father was in his car reading a book. But the daughter also did not witness the shooting. And no book was found at the scene, Murray said. The prosecutor said that officers told Scott at least 10 times to drop the weapon before Vinson opened fire.Murray said that while criminal charges are not appropriate, \"I know some are going to be frustrated.\" He said he met with Scott's family Wednesday morning to tell them about his decision and said the family was \"extremely gracious.\" Scott's family attorneys: Our work isn't overThe district attorney's announcement that no charges would be filed \"doesn't end our inquiry,\" Scott family attorney Charles Monnett said. \"We still have concerns,\" Monnett said. \"We still have real questions about what decisions were made that day,\" such as whether police could have used better deescalation techniques that may have prevented Scott's death.

He won 22 states and 13 million voters, and that ain't nothing.\"Sanders beat Clinton in the Democratic primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin -- states that Trump won in the general election.But Conway said those Sanders supporters didn't fully come around for the former secretary of state even after Sanders endorsed her and she won the nomination at the Democratic National Convention.\"The fact is his supporters were still out there protesting her,\" Conway told Tapper in a conversation that included Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. \"He was in -- he was in the hall being, you know, a dutiful Democratic Convention soldier, but his -- his supporters were not.\"RELATED: Robby Mook: Trump benefited from Russia 'intervening in the election'Both former campaign managers were in Boston for several events dedicated to analyzing the presidential election, which ended last month with Trump's upset victory.\"And you saw on Election Day, if you read the polls, that still many of them were upset by the way that (Sanders) was treated and that their views that they took to the table were never really assimilated into the Clinton-Kaine campaign,\" she added. \"I assumed her choice of (Virginia Sen.) Tim Kaine had something to do with Virginia, but it may have had something to do with not being overshadowed.\"Sanders -- who was popular with millennial voters and working class white voters -- was originally included on a list of possible vice presidential candidates. Clinton struggled with both of those groups throughout her campaign.But Clinton ultimately went with Kaine. \"The decision about who should be your vice president should be a decision about who you think is ready to do the job and who you can see as a partner,\" Mook said. \"You know, someone down the hall that you can call on to work with you.  And that's how Hillary approached this, and I assume that's how Donald Trump approached this as well.\" The former secretary of state believed that Kaine represented her \"views and values\" best.\"At the end of the day, she felt like Tim Kaine would represent her views and values if, God forbid, he had to become president; that he had the background and preparation to do the job. But also that that partnership and that chemistry was the right one,\" Mook said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/politics/bernie-sanders-kellyanne-conway-robby-mook/index.html"}
{"_id":"Kendall, Cara and ... Katie Grand? Meet the fashion industry's secret weapon","articleText":"This video is a segment from the CNN Style show. (CNN)As social media continues to lift the veil on the inner workings of the fashion industry, the teams that craft the images -- make up artists, hairdressers, photographers and stylists -- have, in many cases, as much influence as the models and designers they support. This is certainly true of super stylist Katie Grand. She may not be a household name, but within the fashion industry she is something of a legend. Grand has been at the forefront of cutting edge fashion and youth culture since the nineties, when she teamed up with photographer Rankin and Jefferson Hack to help start Dazed & Confused, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. She now helms her own Condé Nast-backed biannual, LOVE magazine, creating some of the most dynamic and memorable fashion images in recent memory, with stars like Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner and Madonna gracing its cover.On top of her editorial work, Grand has also had a hand in shaping fashion shows and campaigns for the likes of Miu Miu, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.Arguably her most famous and longstanding relationship is with American designer Marc Jacobs. The pair have been friends from Jacobs days as creative director at Louis Vuitton, where Grand styled many of the womens and menswear shows, to now his eponymous label. \"She's like a sounding board,\" Jacobs told CNN Style presenter Derek Blasberg at LOVE's most recent issue launch. \"I think I become so overwhelmed by choices, and what's great is to have someone outside of the company who has an outside eye.\"When asked about the source of her talent, Jacobs commented:\"There's no crystal ball, there's no formula, it's very instinctive. I think when people love something with all their heart, the impulse and the instincts are just there.\"This video is a segment from the CNN Style show.","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/fashion/katie-grand-marc-jacobs-style-show/index.html"}
{"_id":"Kentucky football game shooting leaves 2 dead","articleText":" (CNN)Gunfire erupted near an annual Thanksgiving Day football event in Kentucky, leaving two people dead and five others wounded, Louisville Metro Police said.The shootings, shortly before 2 p.m. Thursday, happened during what locals know as the annual Juice Bowl, which fills Shawnee Park with hundreds of children and adults for a series of holiday football games. Stephen Washburn was streaming a Facebook Live video when the shooting could be heard in the background. There were 19 shots. The shooters are not visible in the video.The city's mayor, who was about 200 yards from the gunfire, was safely whisked away by security.No arrests so farThe FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined the investigation into the shootings, CNN affiliate WAVE reported. The shooters got away, according to Dwight Mitchell, a spokesman for the Louisville Metro Police Department.Lt. Emily McKinley told reporters Friday that the shootings, which involved people not participating in the Juice Bowl, stemmed from a dispute. No arrests have been made.  Police revised the number of injured Friday from four to five. Their injuries are not life threatening.\"This is very tragic,\" Mitchell said. \"I'm saddened. We've had over 100 homicides in our city... It is a day to be thankful and we're thankful that more people were not hurt.\"Deadly new homicide recordThe Thanksgiving Day deaths brought Louisville's 2016 homicide count to 112, Mitchell said. The record high was 110 homicides in 1971, WAVE reported. Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded could be seen crying inconsolably in video shot by WAVE. They tried to get by police tape that crisscrossed the shooting scene but were held back. Police vehicles were scattered across an open field. A football game continued on another stretch of the vast field.  \"We've had the annual Juice Bowl event going on for decades,\" mayoral spokesman Chris Poynter said. \"It's a family event. It's a festive atmosphere now marred by senseless violence.\"In a Facebook message, Mayor Greg Fischer wrote: \"To have people with guns so disrespect life, Shawnee Park, and neighborhood tradition is sad and has no place in our city.\" He urged residents with information to contact police. \"Witnesses who remain silent, as has been the case with too many shootings in the past, will solve nothing,\" he wrote.A decades-old traditionDonna Grimes told WAVE her grandfather and his friends started the Juice Bowl tradition 50 years ago. Hundreds of people would gather in the park before Thanksgiving dinner. The event was a family affair. \"This is the first time ever (that) shots were fired,\" Grimes told the station. The dead and wounded were sprawled across the grassy field, she said. \"It does not make sense,\" Grimes said of the violence. \"Locking these guys up don't mean nothing. Send them to fight the war since they want to shoot some guns. It's a sad time for Thanksgiving and it's a sad day for the Juice Bowl.\"CNN's Shachar Peled, Dave Alsup and Travis Sattiewhite contributed to this report.

We stressed in all our meetings that wherever security operations might be necessary, civilians must be protected at all times,\" he said.When asked by CNN when human rights groups and media would have access to the area, currently denied by Myanmar's government, Annan said he had discussed it with the country's leaders and hoped they would be allowed in \"fairly soon.\"\"We had the opportunity to discuss at high levels and we were told that humanitarian access will be given for aid to reach the needy. The Commander in Chief did tell us there are areas which they are still clearing and would free (them) up for such operations as soon as a clearance is done,\" he said.The former UN secretary general told journalists he had met with State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi as well as Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw.Rights groups allege Rohingya killingsViolence in Rakhine State flared up in October, after more than a dozen Myanmar soldiers and police were attacked by 300 men armed with knives and pistols.In response, Myanmar's military began an offensive inside the state, resulting in what human rights groups describe as murder, rape and destruction of villages.UN's Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, expressed alarm in a statement released in November to reports of a crackdown against the country's Rohingyas.\"These allegations must be verified as a matter of urgency,\" he said. \"If they are true, the lives of thousands of people are at risk.\"Despite rights groups reporting more than a hundred deaths, the numbers are impossible to confirm as the government has banned journalists and observers from visiting the province.Rakhine Commission formedAnnan first arrived in Myanmar about a week ago to meet with community leaders across the country, along with members of his Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.The commission was set up in August, before the recent violence, and was created to find \"lasting solutions\" to the situation in the Rakhine State, according to the government.The Rohingya are a stateless ethnic minority who regularly face persecution -- the official position of Myanmar's government doesn't recognize the term \"Rohingya\" and instead says they are illegal Bengali migrants.On November 15, Annan issued a statement in which he said he was deeply concerned by the new killings and asked for security to follow the law.\"Violence will not create an environment conducive to peace and inter-communal cohesion, which is a prerequisite for economic progress and prosperity,\" he said.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/asia/myanmar-rakhine-kofi-annan/index.html"}
{"_id":"Kushner at the center of Trump transition 'infighting,' sources say","articleText":" (CNN)Donald Trump's son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner is at the center of the \"infighting\" inside President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, multiple sources tell CNN.Trump, however, tweeted Tuesday night that the process was \"very organized.\"\"Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\" he said.Former Congressman Mike Rogers said Tuesday he parted ways with Trump's transition team, removing an establishment national security voice from the planning process of the next president's cabinet.Rogers was told Monday on the phone that he was out, according to a source familiar with the transition. The source said this was part of an effort to replace the transition team members associated with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who previously headed up the transition team's efforts until being replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  \"Sometimes in politics ... there are people who are in and people who are out. And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie,\" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night.  \"And so there's a whole series of about five of them that fit that criteria that were asked to leave in the last few days. And you know what? That's absolutely the campaign's prerogative. I hope they all stay engaged,\" he added.Kushner has been rubbing allies the wrong way in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, sources say.Kushner's father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.Trump's team of bitter rivalsRogers, who had been working on the transition team for months under Christie, was sidelined as the campaign and transitions merged into one presidential team, with members of Trump's inner circle that were with him through the campaign taking more prominent roles in the transition, according to one source familiar with the transition activity.But another source, a longtime Christie associate, cautioned that there was no \"purge\" of Christie staff, the team that began the transition months ago, and that such a characterization is \"overblown.\" While some Christie staff have left, others are continuing on with the transition team.A high-ranking Trump insider said the so-called \"purge\" focused only on lobbyists.The Christie associate said it makes sense that Pence would want some of his own people involved now that he is running the effort.\"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\" Rogers told Cooper.Earlier Tuesday, Rogers positively described his time period working with the transition team as a \"privilege,\" in a statement to reporters, and said he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Pence and \"the stellar new leadership team.\" \"I look forward to continuing to provide advice and counsel as needed to the incoming Trump administration as they work to make America great again,\" Rogers said in the statement.Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"The Lead,\" Rogers said later Tuesday that he felt the transition team was \"going in a different direction,\" though he noted some confusion on the team.\"Is there a little confusion in New York? I think there is. I think this is growing pains,\" Rogers said.The news of Rogers' departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Rogers' participation in the transition team was seen as a heartening sign for traditional GOP national security advisers.Sources tied to the transition team talking to CNN described the organization's internal disagreements -- mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues -- as a \"knife fight\" on Monday.'Knife fight' as Trump builds an unconventional national security cabinetRogers chaired the House Intelligence Committee while he was in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with an expertise in national securityHe has also been critical of Russia's role in recent hacking episodes, including the hacks of Democratic political groups during the election which the US government attributed to high levels of Russian government. Trump repeatedly declined to acknowledge Russia's role, saying the evidence was inconclusive.Amid the churn in Trump's transition team the Obama White House Tuesday night said it's moving forward with a broader sharing of information.\"We received the MOU signed by Vice President-elect Pence this evening,\" said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokesperson. \"The next step is for the President-elect's transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration.\"  CNN's Tal Kopan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/mikes-rogers-leaves-trump-transition-team/index.html"}

In many cases police involvement was limited, with the matter dealt with by the coroner,\" a police spokesman told CNN. \"A review of these deaths is now underway to establish any suspicious circumstances.\"Police say there is so far nothing to suggest the cases are linked to Port.Port had denied all the charges against him but was found guilty of the murders of fashion student  Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; fellow chef Daniel Whitworth, 21; and forklift truck driver Jack Taylor, 25.READ MORE: Serial killer drugged, raped victimsVictims lured via dating sitesPolice also are under fire for not fingering Port earlier as a killer and possibly saving some victims' lives.Seven police officers are under investigation for gross misconduct over their handling of the case, and another 10 police officers have been accused of misconduct. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating \"how officers responded to the four deaths before the homicide investigation was launched, including the nature of the investigative work undertaken, how evidence was examined and how similarities between the cases were considered,\" it said in a statement.Port, who lived alone in Barking, east London, was arrested after the first death but only charged with perverting the course of justice -- which meant he was able to carry on killing after serving a short jail term. He lured his victims to his home using online dating sites and then either injected them with drugs or spiked their drinks using \"poppers,\" Viagra and sleeping pills as well as GHB and crystal meth. Port then dragged the bodies of his victims out into the street and left them slumped against walls not far from where he lived, police said.GHB was found in the bodies of each of the four men who died. And in three of the four deaths, drugs were planted on or near victims' bodies to make it look as though they had overdosed.Port will be sentenced on Friday. Killer showed no remorse\"Port is a highly devious, manipulative and self-obsessed individual who has not once shown a shred of remorse for his actions,\" said Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Crime and Operations command.He said Port was \"motivated by his overwhelming desire to have sex with younger gay men while they were unconscious through drugs.\"None of the sexual assault victims had contacted police before Port was charged in relation to the four deaths.\"I hope Port's conviction today offers reassurance to the LGBT community that if you have been a victim of crime our officers will take you seriously, treat your situation with the utmost sensitivity and do their very best to bring offenders before the courts,\" said Cundy.\"We can't rule out the fact there may be other victims out there who suffered at Port's hands and have yet to come forward. We would appeal for them to contact us as soon as possible.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/europe/stephen-port-serial-killer-investigation/index.html"}

{"_id":"Los Angeles bolsters security after transit system threat","articleText":" (CNN)Law enforcement in Los Angeles bulked up its presence Tuesday on the Metro transit system after a tip about a threat.The FBI says it got the tip from a foreign government source Monday and passed it along to authorities.The Universal City Metro Red Line station was the object of a potential threat that was to take place Tuesday. More police and sheriff's deputies, K-9 bomb teams and undercover officers have been deployed along the transit system.Authorities briefed reporters Monday because of the specificity of the threat and assured commuters that there would be increased patrols and the Metro lines would be safe.\"This could be real, it could be a hoax, but we must remain calm but vigilant,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said, according to CNN affiliate KABC-TV.Los Angeles FBI Field Office Assistant Director Deirdre Fike said the anonymous threat came from a man and particularly identified the Red Line that stops at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti took the train Tuesday from Universal City and reassured people of the line's safety.\"One of the lessons from today is all of us can be the eyes and ears on this system and throughout the city,\" Garcetti said.There was a visible presence of security from local law enforcement and the US Department of Homeland Security at Union Station, the main hub for the Metro subway, CNN's Casey Wian reported. There were at least double the number of law enforcement personnel one usually sees during the morning commute on the Metro Red Line, Wian said. \"Passenger volume also seemed lighter than normal, and I noticed several passengers as they entered subway cars looking both ways and carefully scrutinizing the car before choosing a seat,\" Wian said. CNN's David Daniel rode southbound Tuesday morning on the Red Line. \"I boarded at North Hollywood at 8 a.m., and while there was a large and obvious security presence both outside and inside the station, the ridership level seemed fairly normal,\" Daniel said.

{"_id":"Lucas Hedges is enjoying his breakout moment after breaking your heart in 'Manchester by the Sea'","articleText":" (CNN)CNN's Fresh Faces interview series aims to spotlight some of the talented newcomers making a splash in their respective fields. As Award Season ramps up and the Oscars race begins to take shape, look for chats with some of the young stars whose performances on the big screen are earning equally big buzz. Name: Lucas Hedges, 19Hometown: Brooklyn, NYWhere you might know him from: \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" NBC's \"The Slap\" Currently starring in: Probable Best Picture contender \"Manchester By the Sea,\" a movie that was recently named Film of the Year by the National Board of ReviewHe plays: Patrick, a darkly humorous, hockey-loving teen whose emotionally distant uncle (Casey Affleck) becomes his guardian after the death of his father (Kyle Chandler)Praise: Scored two Critics Choice Awards nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Best Young Actor/ActressActing hero: Ralph FeinnesMost recent movie he watched and loved: \"Sing Street\" \"Manchester by the Sea\" is one of the best-reviewed films of the year. What has it been like for you to see the film earn such a positive response? It does feel a bit like I'm living in split worlds. I go back to Brooklyn and the film sort of fades away. Then I return to this other world, [with] the cast and the director reminiscing about the process and celebrating it. So it does feel like there's a duality between the present and the past. Also, the other night I went to the Governor's Awards and meeting all my heroes and some of them had seen my movie. That was incredibly surreal.Who were you wowed by the most? Well, I met Andrew Garfield. I actually met him several years ago when he was doing \"Death of a Salesman\" [on Broadway]. I was taken backstage because I knew the producers and met him briefly. But this time, I was meeting him and we were the same height. That was amazing. And a few minutes later, I got to meet Emma Stone, who had seen \"Manchester.\" It was back to back, so I got these two wonderful punches to the face. I mean, they weren't punches in the face.Although, that'd be a heck of a story if Emma Stone came up and punched you in the face. Oh, yeah. I wouldn't mind that. So, I want to go back in time a bit: What was your first paying job in the industry? Technically, my first paying job was I was an extra in my dad's movie \"Dan in Real Life.\" And it's funny because it was ridiculous. I worked one day, I had one line, and I made more on that movie than I did any of the following speaking [roles] I did. For some weird reason, I think it was some glitch, they paid me for four weeks of work. Maybe my dad rigged it so he'd get his son some more money. It set the expectations a little high. Yeah, it definitely did, but I can't complain. So your dad, Peter Hedges, is in the business, as you mentioned. What was his reaction when you first started showing an interest in acting? I don't know if there was ever one moment where I was like, \"Dad, this is what I want to do.\" I did the plays in middle school. I was cast as a gate in my fourth grade play, and every year I got a bigger role. Then in 7th grade, I played Smike in \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" and the casting director saw me and asked me to audition for a movie. That movie led to me getting \"Moonrise Kingdom.\" Then it was like, \"Maybe this is something I could do. I'm gonna try it.\" You're also in college, correct? I'm taking the year off from school right now. So I did a year in an acting conservatory in North Carolina. But it seems sort of like it didn't make that much sense to be at a conservatory this year because of the work I've been getting. I've done two films and I'm about to do a play. It just seemed like it made more sense to make the most of these opportunities. The characters I'm getting to play are more in depth characters than the characters I'd be getting to play at school.How old were you when you got the script for \"Manchester by the Sea\"? I got this script when I was 17. I was a senior in high school. And what was your reaction to the material? Because it's a heavy script and, to be honest, I'm not sure how I would process it at 17.It was the best part I'd ever read for a teenager. You don't see parts this good for adults. Most movies I audition for, I'm just the kid of someone. I'm somebody's kid. And Patrick is a force. He's a force of nature. He is somebody's kid but that's not how we see him. He's not an association. He's not associated with another actor, he's a force in the film. On set you got a chance to work with big names, obviously. How was that as a learning experience? Well, it's funny because either way, if I had or hadn't gotten the movie, I would have worked on something Kenneth Lonergan related because I was doing scenes from \"This Is Our Youth\" in my acting class. So it was either I get to work on it or I get to work on a new film directed by him for two months. I lucked out.  And working with Casey [Affleck] was very intimidating at first, but almost immediately after I started, he blocked out time for us to have together. He said to me on the first weekend, \"Look, all I'm doing this weekend is laundry and setting up living here. But I can give you 2.5 hours on Saturday and Sunday if you want to come over and work.\" And it was that kind of openness from him that allowed me to trust him. On top of that, though, we didn't get that much time to rehearse together because he had to leave. I forget what he had to leave for, but he couldn't rehearse for the amount of time that we would have initially hoped. That ended up serving us, though, because there's an estrangement between the two characters. So the lack of rehearsal time was beneficial in the end.Lastly, I need to ask you about one of the best scenes in the movie, which involves a breakdown and a freezer full of frozen chicken. It's a perfect example of that estrangement -- Patrick's uncle doesn't know how to deal with his nephew's pain. It was sad and heartbreaking and awkward, all at the same time. How did you craft that scene with Casey? The great thing about scenes that involve nervous breakdowns -- in the little experience I have doing them -- is that there's no way to craft it. You just have to do it and it sort of crafts itself in just being incredibly messy. So it was actually the only scene I tried not to think about going into filming it. I couldn't intellectualize any of it. There's nothing else I could do except do it. This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed.

(and) definitely not a controlled ditching,\" he said. \"The barnacles on board will hopefully provide some clues as to the location of the crash site and route followed.\" Gibson found the debris in June on the island of Nosy Boraha, off the east coast of Madagascar.MH370's disappearance is one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries. The plane vanished from radar while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, with 239 people on board, on March 8, 2014.Since July 2015, about six pieces of wreckage have been confirmed as likely coming from the missing plane, although not all pieces could be completely verified. In October, a fragment of plane wing discovered in Mauritius in May was confirmed as coming from MH370, Australia's Transport Safety Bureau said. Earlier in 2016, Gibson found a piece of a plane wreckage off the Mozambique coast.

As an adult, she channeled that love into volunteer work at the San Francisco humane society. She was ultimately walking dogs there five days a week.That's when she noticed the older dogs were not being adopted.\"Most of them would end up getting euthanized,\" Franklin said. \"They didn't stand a chance compared to the puppies.\"The plight of these senior dogs broke Franklin's heart.\"I could feel their hope draining and my hope draining with them,\" she said.  So in 2007, Franklin started Muttville out of her home. The nonprofit rescues senior dogs from shelters and finds them forever homes. The group now has its own facility and has adopted out more than 4,000 senior dogs. Some dogs come to Muttville because their owner passed away or cannot care for them. Each week, the group gets around 150 requests from shelters or individuals to take their elderly dogs.At Muttville, the dogs roam in large rooms filled with big beds and couches. The organization also has a network of more than 100 foster families, allowing more dogs to be saved.\"They have so much to teach us. I've learned to be present and live in the moment,\" she said. \"They've taught me to let the little stuff fly.\"CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Franklin about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: Senior dogs can need a lot of medical care. How does Muttville handle that? Franklin: We have our own vet suite at Muttville. Every single dog that comes in sees our vet. They get de-fleaed, dewormed; they get their full vaccines and microchipping. And then we go a step further, doing full blood panels and urinalysis. We do that all in-house now, which has just saved us so much time and gotten the dogs ready for adoption so much quicker","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/07/us/cnn-hero-sherri-franklin/index.html"}

Maria Chin Abdullah was arrested November 18, on the eve of a mass rally against Prime Minister Najib Razak organized by Bersih, a coalition of pro-democracy groups. The 59-year-old was detained under the Security Offenses (Special Measures) Act 2012, or SOSMA, a law designed to tackle terrorism under which suspects can be detained without trial for 28 days.Malaysia: Crackdown on free speech creates 'culture of fear''Not a terrorist'\"My detention is illegal,\" Chin told supporters following her release. \"I'm not a terrorist and neither is Bersih a terrorist organization.\" She was kept in solitary confinement in what Amnesty International described as \"deplorable conditions.\" Chin described the experience as \"humiliating.\"\"In solitary confinement, the lights are on 24 hours a day and you wake up and don't know whether it's day or night.\" The mother of three said that she was also denied access to her family and lawyers during her detention although she was allowed to see them for an hour on November 27.Mass ralliesOn November 19, Bersih held its fifth major rally in Kuala Lumpur to press for electoral reforms in Malaysia. While previous rallies focused mainly on greater democratic rights and electoral reform, this year had an added dimension following the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption scandal that surrounds Prime Minister Najib Razak. According to police, Chin was arrested after \"documents detrimental to parliamentary democracy\" were found in Bersih's offices during a raid. Her detention, a police spokesman said, was to give authorities sufficient time to obtain more information on the organization's \"foreign funding.\" Police did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Cartoonist detainedAs Chin was released, another prominent government critic was arrested. Cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, known as Zunar, was arrested on suspicion of sedition Saturday following an exhibition at the Georgetown Literary Festival. He is currently banned from leaving the country and faces nine charges with a potential maximum prison term of 43 years. Zunar told CNN he was released after a day's detention and has to report back to police next month. \"They said I will likely be charged under the Sedition Act,\" he said. Last month, Human Rights Watch warned of an ongoing crackdown on critics of Najib's administration that was fueling a \"culture of fear\" in Malaysia.

{"_id":"Many asexual people still fantasize about sex, study finds","articleText":"Researchers aren't quite sure exactly what asexuality is. On paper, the concept is clear -- asexual people simply don't experience sexual attraction -- but since scientists are so early on in their attempts to understand the phenomenon, they're not quite sure about many of the specifics. There are a bunch of interesting, obvious questions touching on facets of sexuality that don't entail getting together with another person: To take two, how often do asexual people masturbate? Do they have sexual fantasies?To better understand this group, a trio of University of British Columbia researchers, Morag Yule, Lori Brotto, and Boris Gorzalka, conducted a survey in which they asked 739 people, 351 of them asexual (as defined by an inventory of questions designed to capture asexuality), about their sexual experiences and fantasies. The results, just published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, strongly suggest that the \"asexual\" label could be capturing too broad a group, and that it might be time to get a bit more fine-grained.Why straight men have sex with each otherHere's the key bit from the paper's conclusion:\"While there are a number of differences between asexual and sexual groups in terms of patterns of masturbation and sexual fantasy, as well as in contents of sexual fantasy, the similarity between the groups on several of these measures is striking. For example, nearly half of asexual women and three quarters of asexual men reported both experiencing sexual fantasy and masturbating, despite reporting a lack of sexual attraction to other people and identifying as asexual. Further, there was significant overlap in the sexual fantasies experienced by participants, regardless of their asexual or sexual status. Sexual fantasies have long been thought to reveal an individual's innermost desires. However, the current data suggest that if this is true, individuals do not necessarily act on these desires. An asexual individual may not experience sexual attraction, but may nonetheless engage in sexual fantasy, perhaps to facilitate physiological sexual arousal and masturbation. The sexual fantasies may not be reflections of innate sexual wants or desires.\"More research will be needed to ascertain whether this is because the individual cannot act on these desires (in the case of being attracted to fictional characters), because social constraints prohibit them from doing so, or because there is a disconnect between their subjective sense of self in relation to sexual targets. Further, these findings suggest that sexual fantasies are not, in fact, ubiquitous, as previous writings have suggested. What makes one individual have sexual fantasies, and whether they appear spontaneously or deliberately, versus another individual not having fantasies, is a fascinating area of inquiry that may also inform the debate on whether lack of sexual fantasies should be a marker of a sexual desire disorder.\"The key takeaway, again, is that when it came to fantasies and masturbation, there was simply less of a difference between the sexual and asexual groups than one might expect.Why some couples have more sexAnother really interesting aspect of the paper dealt specifically with asexual people's fantasies, which were elicited by open-ended questions on the survey. Oftentimes, they fantasized in a third-person sort of way, with both asexual men and women far more likely than their sexual counterparts to fantasize about situations not involving them.A few examples from asexual respondents:\"I do have sexual fantasies but most of the time they do not involve me or any real person. I sexually fantasize about fictional male couples and their romantic and sexual relationships and events. They are all monogamous relationships where they are faithful to one another (no affairs). With fictional male couples, my sexual fantasies can involve many and varying sexual preferences and fetishes. [...]\" (female, 19 years old)\"I don't put myself into my fantasies. That is thoroughly unappealing to me. Instead, I imagine other people in sexual situations, and focus on their thoughts and feelings for a sort of vicarious arousal. I don't want to do anything sexual with any of the people I imagine, and by themselves, they don't turn me on. I think it's because I'm not capable of feeling sexual attraction or lust, so I mentally conjure up people who are and empathize with them (though my ideas of how they experience lust are, since I'm asexual, awfully vague in some ways and probably way off base in others)\" (female, 32 years old)\"I enjoy watching other people enjoy their sexuality. I like the role of being strictly a voyeur but I love being the cause of them enjoying their sexuality. Although I am very excited by these situations I wouldn't call it sexual excitement. Although my body is clearly aroused by it, I have no desire to attend to that arousal.

{"_id":"Marketing genius or mad man? The man who sells sneakers for $132K","articleText":" (CNN)Shoppers who enter the Buscemi boutique in downtown Manhattan searching for the footwear brand's signature leather sneakers are greeted first by five gilded pyramids. The structures, according to the label's founder, Jon Buscemi, have significance beyond their role as an eye-catching display. \"It's a mix to showcase the shoe and to tell the story of going to the beginning, where luxury started,\" Buscemi explains. \"In Egypt.\"Though the reference Buscemi is making with the tableau is historical, the product he's using them to highlight is modern. Since the store opened in September, the largest pyramid has housed a one-of-a-kind pair of diamond-encrusted white sneakers that retail for $132,000. Read: Meet the man who has dedicated 40 years to crafting art out of hairIt's an astronomical sum for a pair of shoes, but speaks to a strategy Buscemi has employed with great success since launching his namesake brand in 2013. With the appeal of conspicuous consumption waning, Buscemi and like-minded brands are emphasizing the uniqueness of well-made products, and the value of providing an experience for today's luxury consumer.\"Buscemi is an incredibly smart combination of modern and traditional luxury,\" says Ana Andjelic, senior vice president and global strategy director at Havas LuxHub, a consulting firm specializing in the luxury sector. \"He provides ammunition for one's lifestyle and creates culture codes -- versus status symbols -- that express certain tastes. Luxury today is less about having money to buy something expensive, and more about having taste to know what to buy.\"Luxury for the modern age As headline-grabbing as six-figure sneakers are, Buscemi is the first to downplay the importance of a hefty price tag. \"There are brands out there that are very expensive, and the quality just simply isn't there,\" he says. \"When I think of luxury brands, I think of brands like Asprey. I think of brands like Hermès.\"The nod to French fashion house Hermès is particularly apt. Buscemi's first product to market was his 100mm high-top sneaker, which cribs design elements from Hermès' Birkin bag, one of the most coveted items in today's fashion landscape. Read: Diamond-encrusted Hermès Birkin sells for over $300KThe sneakers come with 18k-gold-plated hardware, including a decorative lock that mirrors the Birkin's closure. \"Every woman goes for this bag, and it's hard to get,\" Buscemi explains. \"We wanted to have that same vibe with the shoe.\"The Buscemi 100mm shoe was initially conceived as part of an art project, a one-off assortment of everyday luxury items -- like leather dog leashes and a coffee sleeve with hand-painted edges -- based on the flashy persona of Buscemi's childhood neighbor on Long Island, New York. \"The shoe was the lead singer in the band and got most of the recognition because it's something that no one's seen before,\" he says. And so Buscemi the brand was born. In the time since, Buscemi has introduced nearly 30 different styles of sneakers for men, women and toddlers, most with a price tag that hovers around $1,000. A growing empire Buscemi rarely advertises, relying instead on word of mouth. He likens his product packaging to a \"symphony orchestra,\" and customers can have their sneakers resoled free of charge. The 20-hour manufacturing process for each pair ensures quality is consistent and, vitally, keeps volume down. This is in direct opposition to the expansion of luxury players like Gucci and Chanel who, according to Andjelic, are \"opening up millions of stores, all of which are selling identical stuff.\" Read: How a good hat could change your life\"It's the internet culture. We want to have something that no one among our friends has,\" she adds. \"When everyone who has a thousand dollars can buy a pair of Givenchy shoes, that's not luxury anymore.\"The first batch of 100mm sneakers was limited to 600, but Buscemi now produces thousands of pairs of shoes a month, available in 37 countries.

{"_id":"Married to an inmate: the ultimate test of commitment","articleText":"What do you think about when you hear the words \"prison love\"? Lisa Ling goes beyond the stereotypes and clichés to hear these unconventional love stories on \"This is Life\" Sunday, November 27 at 10 p.m. ET. (CNN)Every year, an estimated 2 million couples in the US vow to stick together \"for better or for worse.\"But what happens when the \"worse\" part of marriage unexpectedly includes one person serving a lengthy jail sentence? \"It's kind of like your spouse died,\" says Laure Clemons, who began a support group for relatives of prisoners after her husband was sentenced to six years following a deadly drunk driving accident. \"I can remember how lonely it felt.\"Suddenly, the usual relationship hurdles are stacked up against forced separation, monitored phone calls and rare physical contact. And that's not to mention the immense stigma that comes with being involved with someone who's been convicted of a crime. \"To deal with that you need to make a choice,\" chaplain Matt Peterson, who's advised prisoners on marriage, explained to CNN's Lisa Ling. \"It's loving someone through the good times and bad.\" But with over 800,000 divorces and annulments happening in the US each year, how realistic is it for a relationship to overcome the weight of incarceration?Meet three couples who've had to face that question and put their promises to the test. Keeping faith aliveJennifer McCook pulled a large piece of paper from her office drawer and sketched out the image of a Christmas tree.Because that's \"what you do after Thanksgiving, right?\" Jennifer says. \"You put up a Christmas tree.\" It's a simple arts and crafts project, but one that can make a huge difference for her husband, Brian. He's in prison.When Jennifer met Brian, he was sober and full of life. He was secure, a man of faith, and without any complicated layers. They did everything together: shopping trips to Macy's, golfing, grabbing groceries from the store. He loved to fish while Jennifer read next to him, and would make the bed every morning -- taking on the chore Jennifer avoids at all costs. These days, Jennifer looks past what she sees in front of her -- Brian, in a jumpsuit, locked up -- to that Brian she remembers. They've just begun a rocky journey. For the next three and half years, Brian will live at the Minnesota Correctional Facility for something he's battled his entire adult life: addiction.At a sports game on July 4, Brian was hit with a baseball and rushed to the hospital. He was put on painkillers, a trigger of his past. Brian turned to alcohol almost immediately. The next week, when the McCooks went on a family trip, Brian was drunk and belligerent. Very quickly, he was charged with being drunk and disorderly and making terroristic threats. He was ultimately arrested for these violations against a 2014 DWI probation.Brian has lost so much since his arrest over the summer -- freedom, work, friends -- but he won't lose his wife. The Maple Grove, Minnesota, realtor and mom of two believes God has a plan. \"We are finding a lot of clarity in our lives by looking to our faith,\" Jennifer says. They are determined to have a stronger outcome.Brian is currently a half-hour drive from Jennifer, and she's able to see him two to four times a week. During their visits, they sit across from each other as if they were in an airport waiting room. Lately, Jennifer finds herself wearing Brian's deodorant. \"I miss his smell,\" she explains tearfully. Like many women who lose their partner to the prison system, Jennifer has to make do without her husband's paycheck. Maintaining work is a recurring concern. \"It's difficult for people to trust someone with hundreds of thousands of dollars of an investment,\" Jennifer says. \"My biggest fear is the impact it might have on my business now that I am married to a felon.\"With a little help from her friends, family, and faith, Jennifer plans to persevere. \"I have what a lot of women want in a marriage,\" Jennifer says. \"I do not have a sad life.\" For better or worseIt was the 1980s, and Ann Edenfield Sweet had what many people dreamed of. She was working as a flight attendant, happily married to an airline captain, and the mom of four young boys.In 1986, that relatively easy life changed forever. Ann's then-husband was arrested for conspiracy to import drugs. One year later, he began his sentence in New Mexico, four and a half hours away from Ann and the children in Albuquerque.Gone were the days when Ann's husband was around to take the boys to soccer and tennis, or on fun family trips. Ann was now the single mother with four boys at church on Sundays. A double income household shrunk to one. And a successful, seemingly super-mom became unemployed and broke, tasked with raising her boys -- all under the age of 7 -- alone. \"Suddenly, we were the lepers,\" Ann remembers. \"No one wanted to go see us. The boys couldn't play with the kids next door.\" Ann went into survival mode almost immediately; she says she was blindsided by her husband's arrest, in which all of their assets were seized and frozen. Everything remained uncertain, but one thing Ann knew for sure: she was sticking by her husband under a single vow. \"I married for better or for worse,\" she says.Every six weeks, she'd put five meals in paper bags and take the boys to visit their dad. It was a costly, lengthy road trip, and not one made for young children. They'd sit in chairs across from their father during the five-hour visiting windows without being able to touch him or take in a hug. While her husband had structure in jail, Ann felt she had nothing over the years -- no recipe or rules to guide her through this mess. Eighteen lawsuits had piled up from his incarceration, but the idea of divorce was only discussed briefly under the context that separating Ann from her husband's case would financially benefit the family. Her husband's imprisonment also forced Ann to stop working. She was desperate for money and was no longer considered an appealing candidate for hire. \"I became a master at garage sales and thrift stores,\" Ann says. With what little she had, Ann would buy auctioned items, turn around and sell them for more.While she had been told by a prison chaplain that most marriages under these circumstances don't make it, that wasn't going to be her outcome, she thought.\"I always felt we had a good marriage. He was a good dad, (and) I am a woman of faith,\" Ann says. \"I believed that you could get through things.\" As the years passed by, Ann and the children prepared for her husband's release. \"Every day he is behind bars is a day of your life as well,\" Ann says. It wasn't until her husband came home six years later that Ann realized how complicated their situation really was. She'd become the youth director at her church while playing both roles as mom and dad, caregiver, and breadwinner. The kids had grown into their own people.Meanwhile, her spouse's self-esteem as a husband and father had diminished, and employment seemed a long-lost dream.Four years later, after many attempts to salvage their 28-year marriage, Ann and her husband divorced. \"I can't imagine we wouldn't still be married, but incarceration is so dramatic,\" Ann says. \"It changed him and it changed me.\"All in the name of loveWhen Vicki Juarez first met her partner, David Morales, 12 years ago, she quickly noticed two things: His bashfulness, and his tattoos. Vicki was the store manager of a Dollar General in Lubbock, Texas, and David was the truck operator helping her out that day with a big shipment of inventory. Vicki was recently divorced and wasn't looking for anything romantic, but David was different from other men she'd met. David \"seemed kind of shy,\" Vicki remembers. \"I made sure he knew I wasn't afraid of him.\" After spending an entire day unloading inventory and getting to know each other, Vicki gave David her number.David took Vicki out for a date. He was kind, respectful, and attentive -- traits many people value in a partner. In short time, the two were practically inseparable. Vicki knew that David had been in and out of the prison system a couple of times prior to meeting her, and eventually the cobwebs from his rough past surfaced again as he struggled with alcohol addiction. It was his honesty that gave Vicki a sense of comfort during these trying times. \"He sat down and told me everything, so I never felt like there were any secrets,\" she says.But David's drinking became more frequent. After receiving two DWIs, an attorney gave David a sobering reality check. \"He told him, 'If you get one more, there's nothing I can do for you,'\" Vicki recalls.That wasn't enough. In August 2010, David was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after receiving a third DWI. Now, Vicki is just past the midway point of waiting for David's release, having made the decision to stay six years ago.Since making her choice, family, friends, and even David's children are constantly after one simple answer. Why?\"I'm not a desperate woman,\" Vicki rebuts. \"I don't stay with him because I am desperate. I stay with him because I chose him to be my life partner.\" David has a lot more work to do in Vicki's eyes, but to her, he's still well worth the wait.\"I think people think that we are stupid,\" Vicki says. \"We have to be stronger than most people.\"With four years to go, Vicki waits patiently for the day she can touch David again. He lives in segregation, so Vicki is unable to call him. She misses his voice deeply. They've made their situation work with letters and, when she's able to afford it, visits to David's prison in Wichita Falls, 225 miles away. He's always behind glass. \"David is not an animal -- he is a man. He is sensitive, he is caring, he loves people,\" Vicki says. This man may someday become her husband, a discussion the two lovers have already had. \"He has made some bad choices in his life that he is paying for. But in spite of the bad things, he's done more good.\"This is why she stays.CNN's Nikaline McCarley contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/us/marriage-prison-love-lisa-ling/index.html"}
{"_id":"Mars lander slammed into red planet after data glitch","articleText":" (CNN)The Schiaparelli probe's crash landing on Mars last month was caused by a sensor malfunction, the European Space Agency has found. A preliminary investigation discovered that the onboard computer tasked with measuring rotation of the lander mistakenly thought it was much closer to the planet's surface -- when in fact it was still approximately 3.7 km (2.29 miles) above Mars. The ESA said in an update Wednesday that the glitch triggered a knock-on effect, resulting in the lander plummeting into the planet at 335 mph (540 kph).\"This in turn successively triggered a premature release of the parachute and the backshell, a brief firing of the braking thrusters and finally activation of the on-ground systems as if Schiaparelli had already landed,\" the ESA said in a statement.European space officials have been able to replicate simulations of the event from recovered data and believe that up until that point, most of Schiaparelli's mission had transpired as expected.  Named for Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the probe had been part of a larger mission, ExoMars with its companion craft -- the Trace Gas Orbiter, which successfully reached Mars' orbit in October.  \"ExoMars is extremely important for European science and exploration,\" Roberto Battiston, president of Italy's ASI space agency said Wednesday. \"Together with all the participating states in the program, we will work towards the successful completion of the second ExoMars mission.Search for life on MarsThe next phase of the mission will commence in 2018 when the Trace Gas Orbiter will start to sniff out the source of methane on Mars - which could point to signs of life on the planet. The presence of methane is a signature of life on Earth, so the orbiting spacecraft will try to detect it and determine where it is coming from.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/health/schiaparelli-cause-mars-crash/index.html"}
{"_id":"Mars mission astronauts could experience brain damage, study says","articleText":" (CNN)Astronauts on a mission to Mars will be expected to rely on their memory, multitasking and decision-making skills to handle the first manned expedition beyond the moon. But the harmful radiation from galactic cosmic rays throughout their journey could cause them to experience cognitive impairment in these key areas, as well as increased depression and anxiety, according to a new study. The effects of exposure to highly charged and ionized particles during extended deep-space travel could be long-lasting and without resolve, similar to dementia.\"These charged particles are very dangerous,\" said Charles Limoli, study co-author and professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Irvine. \"The reason is, they are very energetic and fully ionized, and when they travel through the body, they produce this type of damage that the cells and tissues of your body find very difficult to recover from. Now, it really looks like the complications associated with these exposures to the brain are becoming one of the more difficult to deal with.\" The particles are believed to originate from the remnants of ancient supernovae. Though NASA has known for a long time that the space environment is a radioactive one, astronauts have largely been within Earth's protective magnetosphere aboard the International Space Station. The only astronauts to directly encounter galactic cosmic rays were those embarking on short-duration trips to the moon. But just trying to reach Mars will take six to nine months. Even radiation shielding on the craft used to take astronauts to Mars isn't the ultimate prevention tactic. Currently, there is no technology that can stop these particles from penetrating spacecraft and affecting the astronauts, Limoli said. What researchers can learn from miceLimoli and his team exposed mice to similar radiation, such as fully ionized oxygen and titanium, over time. They studied their brain activity and structure when the mice went through exercises to test areas of cognitive function. Their learning, memory, multitasking, cognitive flexibility in changing situations and even behavioral adaptation were altered or negatively impacted. The radiation disrupted and reduced dendrites and spines within their neural networks, which make up the highway that transmits signals in the brain. The exposure also affected the the brain's process of fear extinction, which can help minimize stress when reflecting back on a bad experience. Without this process, it's easier for someone to become anxious or depressed. Even though the mice provide a good example, it's not yet possible to show how it would affect an astronaut. People aren't lining up to have their brains irradiated either, Limoli said. The data sets from the study provide evidence of potential risk, which he believes is critical for NASA to know.Six months later, the brains of the irradiated mice still shows sign of inflammation and neural circuitry damage. New data, obtained since the study published, indicate that the damage lasts up to a year, which surprised the researchers, Limoli said. Like other obstacles on the journey to reach Mars, Limoli believes this is something that can be overcome and isn't a \"deal-breaker.\" \"These astronauts are not going to come back with full-blown Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"But there is the chance that there will be some mild cognitive impairment, and we just don't know to what extent that will manifest.\"The study was funded by NASA through grants awarded to researchers working with its Human Research Program. NASA has not responded to a request for comment.What might helpOver the past eight years, Limoli's research efforts have largely focused on radiation effects on the brain. He and his team are looking into pharmacological solutions that would target the neurotransmission and signaling pathways in the brain to protect the astronauts during or after the trip. The key is to protect the neural circuitry, because recovering it is much more difficult once it's damaged, Limoli said. This is similar to the issues faced by those undergoing therapeutic radiation for cancers. People recovering from the radiotherapy used to treat some types of cancer are known to suffer cognitive problems for decades. The solutions Limoli and his team hope to find could not only help astronauts on deep space missions, they could have a positive impact for people in radiation situations on Earth. Radiation-resistant fungi is another potential aid for astronauts in the future, according to NASA research scientist Kasthuri Venkateswaran. Species of fungi were found near the Chernobyl accident site, and surprisingly, they were radiotrophic: growing toward the radiation source rather than away from it. Some of the proteins associated with these fungi could be useful for radiation therapy, although research hasn't confirmed this, Venkateswaran said.\"Some of the radiation therapy molecules coming from secondary metabolites of these fungi will be useful for a few things,\" he said. \"One of the things fungi produces lovastatin, which is the antidepressant compound that can be used as radiation therapy compound too.\"Venkateswaran and his team sent species of this fungi to the space station to study how it reacts in microgravity, and their results are promising. The stressful conditions of the space station actually caused the fungi to grow faster. If researchers are able to produce more and learn more about its genes, they might be able to reproduce it and create a medicinal production facility in space. This could be a long way off. The next steps for his research team include purifying the compounds of the fungi. By September, he hopes that they will have finished characterizing the fungi and their compounds. Then, they can patent them, and the compounds can be eventually used in clinical trials. 'A problem that obviously isn't going to go away'Though radiation-resistant fungi compounds may not necessarily help with shielding from galactic cosmic rays, Venkateswaran envisions this as a pharmacological way to help astronauts cope with other space radiation. Astronaut health is the subject of numerous other research initiatives now and going forward. Researchers hope that the initiatives in place to help send humans on deep space missions will also help those on Earth suffering from diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as depression or traumatic brain injury. More investments and plans are being revealed during President Barack Obama's White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday.\"For the adventure in all of us, this obviously is the final frontier,\" Limoli said. \"You would like to think at some point in the future that we will be (going to Mars), and this is a problem that obviously isn't going to go away, is inherent to space, and we've got to figure out how to deal with it. The more we know about it, the better prepared we can be.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/health/mars-mission-astronaut-brain-damage/index.html"}
{"_id":"Massachusetts college stops flying US flag on campus for now","articleText":" (CNN)Hampshire College, a liberal arts institution of about 1,400 students, has taken some heat after deciding not to fly the US flag. A day after the presidential election, the Massachusetts college sided with students who lowered the flag to half-staff. The administration wanted to build student rapport and facilitate discussion on what the flag represents. That angered some people in the Amherst community, where the college is located.And when someone lit the campus' US flag on fire November 10, many more pushed back after the college decided to do away with flying the American flag, at least temporarily.How things happenedFor Veterans Day on November 11, college officials replaced the burned US flag and flew one full-staff.The next day, Hampshire trustees voted to lower the banner to half-staff again, to continue the campus discussion on the flag's meaning.Flying the flag at half-staff \"was meant as an expression of grief over the violent deaths being suffered in this country and globally, including the many U.S. service members who have lost their lives,\" President Jonathan Lash said.Lash regretted the college taking that action as it caused some \"unintentional distress\" over a traditional expression of mourning, school spokesman John Courtmanche told CNN.WWLP: No flags to be flown at Hampshire CollegeOn Monday, Lash announced in a Facebook statement that the college had decided on November 18 that no flags, US or otherwise, would fly over campus for the time being. But students can still fly their own flags.\"Our goal is to give voice to the range of viewpoints on campus across cultures, and hopefully find common ground,\"  Courtmanche said in a statement. \"We've heard from members of our community that, for them and for many in our country, the flag is a powerful symbol of fear they've felt all their lives because they grew up as people of color, never feeling safe. For others, it's a symbol of their highest aspirations for the country.\"John Velis, an Army veteran and state representative, called on the college president to reinstate the US flag immediately.\"The president's position fundamentally does not make sense to me,\" Velis told CNN. \"It is baseless, cowardly, a disgrace,\" he added.Tuesday, Velis wrote a letter addressed to Lash underscoring his position.\"Do I need to remind you, Mr. President, that discussions surrounding these above groups would not even be possible if not for the sacrifices of our service members and veterans,\" he said.\"Mr. President, put back those flags,\" Velis said. On Facebook, an event has been created to rally behind the flag and show respect to US soldiers and veterans. \"In solidarity to the sacrifices of the US Military, we are asking for everyday citizens to stand guard over our American Flag,\" the event description says.Courtmanche said the flag burning incident is still being investigated. \"We do not know who burned the flag,\" he said. \"We do not know if they were one or more students or any other group.What are the laws behind flags?The US President tells the executive branch when to fly the flag half-staff, but it's not a must-do for private individuals, says USA.gov, a government website. \"A local community, a company, a school district, or a federal agency can decide to have all of their flags at half-staff because of the death of an employee, a student, a mayor, or a local police officer,\" the site explains.Hampshire College's flying the US flag half-staff was intended to \"create the space for meaningful and respectful dialogue across the many perspectives represented in our community,\" says Lash. As for the flag burning, US flag desecration has angered people in the past. In 1989, Congress passed a law against setting a US flag on fire.But the Supreme Court the following year halted the law's enforcement, saying the law violated the Constitution's First Amendment. In this case, the Hampshire College's flag belonged to the school so charges for property destruction may apply. Other flag issues Last year, student leaders at the University of California, Irvine,  a public institution, vetoed a resolution prohibiting flags of any nation from being displayed in the lobby of student government offices.While Hampshire College officials led the initiative to take down all flags, the administration at UCI distanced itself from the student-led action publicly. In September, Occidental College in Los Angeles investigated the vandalism of a 9/11 memorial on campus after US flags used in a display were tossed in the trash.And, earlier this month, students burned a US flag on the campus of American University in Washington, D.C. after the presidential election.Critics of Hampshire College's actions say flying the flag half-staff has partisan undertones, Lash said.\"Some have perceived the action of lowering the flag as a commentary on the results of the presidential election -- this, unequivocally, was not our intent,\" he said.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/us/hampshire-college-no-american-flag/index.html"}

{"_id":"Mediterranean diet may be more helpful than statins","articleText":" (CNN)The Mediterranean diet has been credited with doing everything from helping you lose weight to living longer to improving the health of your brain. A new study, looking at its effect on people with poor heart health, shows that the diet may be a huge help for that, too.The observational study was presented at the European Society of Cardiology conference this weekend. It showed that the people who have had a history of cardiovascular disease and stuck closest to the diet had a 37% lower risk of death compared with those who didn't stick with it.A Mediterranean diet is one that is heavy on vegetables and legumes, fish, fruit, nuts and whole grains. Food is cooked in olive oil rather than butter or some other kind of oil. Carnivores can keep poultry and lean cuts of meat on their Mediterranean menu. Red meat, processed food and sugar are off of it.The diet seems to do even better than one of the most prescribed options (PDF) for people with heart problems: cholesterol-lowering statins. On average, statins reduce risk of heart problems about 24%, according to earlier studies. That means the diet looks like a real winner to help with heart health.A lot of doctors like the diet because there are a lot of menu options with it. It even allows for a glass of wine or beer a day, allowing people to stick with it a lot easier than other diets. The new US Dietary Guidelines included the Mediterranean diet as one option Americans could use to stay healthy.Earlier studies showed that people eating the Mediterranean diet have a lower risk of heart attack and stroke. It may lower your risk of cancer, improve your bone health and help you live longer generally. Because the new study is only observational, meaning the subjects acted independently, more research will be needed. But if you have a history of heart problems or your family has had heart issues, you may want to make a switch to this diet.

{"_id":"Mediterranean diet wins again, helps bones","articleText":" (CNN)The Mediterranean diet is well-known for its health benefits on your heart and waistline, but now your bones could benefit too, according to a new study published online by JAMA Internal Medicine. In this study, researchers examined whether diet quality affects bone health in postmenopausal women. They found that women who ate a Mediterranean diet were slightly less likely to suffer from hip fractures. The Mediterranean diet is relatively easy to follow. It involves eating vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. You should limit the amount of meat, dairy, and saturated fat you eat, but on the bright side you can have a glass of red wine at dinner.Researchers analyzed data from 40 clinical centers throughout the United States included in the Women's Health Initiative study. The analysis included 90,014 women with an average age of 64. Participants described their diets in a WHI food frequency questionnaire at the start of the study. Researchers then compared their dietary patterns to four common healthy diets, including the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and two others.Nearly 16 years later, there were 2,121 cases of hip fractures and 28,718 cases of total fractures. Women who adhered the most to a Mediterranean diet were 0.29% less likely to suffer from a hip fracture than women who didn't stick to the diet. The other three diets showed negligible success.\"Our results provide assurance that widely recommended eating patterns do not increase the risk of fractures,\" said lead study author Dr. Bernhard Haring of the University of Wurzburg in Germany. \"This being said, the average woman should follow a healthy lifestyle which includes adopting a healthy dietary pattern and being physically active.\"  Osteoporosis-related fractures are a major burden for health care systems in aging societies, with women particularly affected, said Dr. Haring. Current research results have been inconclusive about whether intake of nutrients involved in bone metabolism can prevent fractures.   However, the results of this study suggest that a healthy diet, specifically a Mediterranean diet, might play a small role in maintaining bone health in postmenopausal women. This latest Mediterranean diet research builds on previous evidence that your health might benefit if you follow this diet. It's been shown that the Mediterranean diet can keep your brain young, help you live longer, manage your weight better, and lower your risk for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. \"At the present time, the U.S. health system almost entirely ignores nutrition in favor of pharmacology and is hugely expensive and ineffective compared with the systems in other countries,\" wrote Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard School of Public Health, in a related commentary. \"Integration of the Mediterranean diet and related dietary patterns into medical practice, hospitals, schools and other institutions has the potential to improve well-being.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/03/28/health/mediterranean-diet-wins-again-helps-bones/index.html"}

Her latest book is \"Italian Fascism's Empire Cinema.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Now it's Italy's turn for uncertainty. By a large margin, Italian voters rejected a constitutional referendum on the reform of the parliamentary system that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, of the center-left Democratic Party, had staked his reputation on. It's a huge victory for the Five Star Movement founded by comedian turned populist politician Beppe Grillo, who compares himself to Donald Trump and has shown a similar genius for marketing -- in this case through his blog. As happened with the outcomes of the Brexit vote in Great Britain and the Presidential election in the United States, this \"No\" vote carried with it an element of protest quite beyond the complicated political system reforms at hand. Italy's uncertain futureWhat does this outcome mean for Italy, and how does this vote add to the trending illiberalism within Europe? Renzi had vowed to resign if a \"No\" vote prevailed, turning the referendum into a plebiscite about his leadership, which grew increasingly unpopular due to the ailing economy. Now it's very likely that Italy will hold elections that could result in what was previously unthinkable: the anti-establishment, and anti-European Union Five Star Movement at the pinnacle of the state, and more power for the right-wing Northern League party as well. The reforms proposed by the 41-year-old Renzi aimed to streamline Italy's government, which is surpassed only by Greece on most indexes of inefficiency.He envisioned (among other things) reducing the size and power of the Italian Senate (right now both House and Senate have equal approval rights on legislation), and a greater centralization of the energy, transportation, and infrastructure sectors.Renzi's critics, which include many Italians on the left, saw the reform as a power play that would remove checks and balances crucial to a healthy democracy. Many of the particularities of Italy's political system (such as decentralization) date from a 1948 Constitution written in the aftermath of two decades of rule by Benito Mussolini and designed to prevent the return of dictatorship. It would be a true irony if the vote against changing this anti-Fascist Constitution ushered in a new period of rightist politics in Italy. At the moment, how a Five Star government would look and act is far from clear. Founded in 2009, it became a political force to contend with when it received more than 25% in the 2013 elections. Yet its platform is still so eclectic that it's been called \"post-ideological.\" It draws in large numbers of young people for its support of web-based democracy, the environment, and sustainable development, and its harsh critiques of globalization and big business.Yet the Five Star Movement certainly does not map onto progressive politics as traditionally defined. Five Star members are economic protectionists, partial to conspiracy theories, and take a hard line against Islam and immigration. Grillo's corrosive comedy has included a \"joke\" that Sadiq Khan, London's Muslim mayor, might \"blow himself up in Westminster.\"And while the party's mantra is direct democracy, Grillo has a rather dictatorial personality. Perhaps that's why he adds his name to the many European politicians who admire Vladimir Putin (the Italian newspaper La Stampa reported that Russian sites were spreading fake news designed to help Grillo). In all of this Grillo brings Italy into line with the ongoing rejection of liberal democracy for something new that is still being defined. The \"go screw yourself\" holiday that Grillo invented (and that's the polite translation) captures the anarchistic and intolerant spirit of a party that despite being Italy's second largest may find it challenging to adjust to the compromises required for effective national governance. Nervous economy?Most urgent, to many, is what Renzi's resignation will mean for Italy's economy, which is the third largest in the eurozone. While analysts at Credit Suisse and elsewhere don't expect an Italexit anytime soon, the Five Star Movement has declared it would hold another referendum on the single currency. The anticipated political instability could deter investors from re-capitalizing a banking sector in crisis due to an estimated 360 billion euros ($380 billion) of bad loans. More crucially for today's results, average Italians have been hard hit by 40% unemployment among young people and stagnant family income overall. Italy should know betterSome of the same anxieties and frustrations that brought Trump to power in America lie behind the rejection of Renzi in the name of something different, no matter how uncertain.  It's this desire for change that's the biggest takeaway from the Italian referendum. Mario Calabresi, the director of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, argued that the \"verbal violence\" and \"hysterical populism\" engendered by this referendum are unprecedented in recent times. Others may have a different name for this: \"authenticity,\" with Grillo its latest political incarnation.  Italy should know better, having spawned another witty leader who campaigned on an \"anti-politics\" agenda, driving the country into ruin: Mussolini. The pull of illiberalism right now seems irresistible, though, as the rightward tilt of Europe makes clear.

{"_id":"Meet the 'Mad Dog' Donald Trump wants to lead the Pentagon","articleText":" (CNN)The next possible US secretary of defense went by the military call sign \"Chaos.\" Revered by his troops as a \"warrior monk\" with a knack for hard-edged quips, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis led troops in Afghanistan in 2001, won laurels for leadership in one of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq War and most recently headed US Central Command, perhaps the military's most complicated and challenging post. Now, Mattis faces an entirely different kind of fight. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to formally nominate the former four-star to head the Pentagon, some Democrats are signaling his confirmation might not be entirely easy. Some observers question whether Mattis' battlefield experience prepares him for the very different task of running an enormous bureaucracy, while senior lawmakers worry about what the 66-year-old's nomination means for maintaining civilian control of the military.Republicans issued glowing testimonials to Mattis and his career. California Rep. Devin Nunes, who heads the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he could think of \"no better candidate to lead America's military in our long fight against jihadism and countering other pressing threats.\" Noting that Mattis hasn't been out of uniform long enough to lead the Pentagon without a congressional waiver, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said that while he \"would make an excellent Secretary of Defense, we must also bear in mind the precedent we would be setting and the impact it would have on the principle of civilian leadership of our nation's military.\"Donald Trump speaks with Taiwan's PresidentKirsten Gillibrand, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee subcommittee on personnel, was more definitive. \"Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy,\" Gillibrand said in a statement Thursday, \"and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\"Just one senator can demand that the waiver for Mattis meet a 60-vote threshold, meaning he would need to get the support of all Republicans and eight Democrats to move toward confirmation next year.  If he's approved, Mattis would be the highest-ranking former officer to serve as defense secretary. The Washington State native and history major led troops through the conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq. From 2010 to 2013, he led Central Command, which oversees the Middle East and Southeast Asia, until the Obama administration let him go over disagreements on Iran. The White House was pushing for a nuclear deal with Tehran in 2013, the same year Mattis was telling the Aspen Security Forum that his top concern as Centcom commander was \"Iran, Iran, Iran.\" Obama to sign Iran sanctions billMattis has since been critical of the deal and of the Obama administration's refusal to engage more aggressively in the Middle East, saying it has fueled extremism in the region. In 2015, he told a congressional panel that the US needed to come out of its \"reactive crouch\" in the Middle East and defend its values. Indeed, Mattis has not been known to mince words. He's affectionately known as \"Mad Dog\" by troops who trade his quips like prized baseball cards. On the news of his nomination, many of those sayings instantly became memes on Twitter. Among them: \"a good soldier follows orders, but a true warrior wears his enemy's skin like a poncho,\" and \"be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\" Human Rights Watch called on Congress to fully examine his views on a number of issues. \"Media accounts suggest that Gen. Mattis doesn't agree with President-elect Trump's more outrageous campaign proposals, such as bringing back waterboarding, targeting terrorist suspects' family members, or tampering with anti-torture laws,\" said Washington director Sarah Margon. She urged that during the confirmation process \"senators make sure Mattis unreservedly repudiates these proposals, acknowledges that they are illegal, and confirms that they are not up for future consideration.\"Mattis is one of a slew of generals Trump has been considering for other Cabinet-level jobs, including Gen. David Petraeus for the State Department, Gen. John Kelly to head Homeland Security and Adm. Mike Rogers as the director of national intelligence.Erin Simpson, a national security consultant and senior editor at WarontheRocks.com, said the incoming administration may be trying to capitalize on public respect for the military by considering so many generals. But \"where there are really weak civilian institutions and an inexperienced president, it just doesn't sit right by me,\" said Simpson. The silver lining, she adds, is that many military and security professionals wary of Trump may be convinced to serve under Mattis. \"It provides some top-cover for other qualified folks to come in who might not have otherwise,\" Simpson said. \"There are a lot of jobs to fill at the Pentagon, this could bring in some talent and that's a net gain.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/politics/donald-trump-james-mattis/index.html"}
{"_id":"Meet the Gnomist: A force for good","articleText":"Saratoga Springs, Utah (CNN)She appreciated magic from an early age. As a small child living in Colorado, she used to sneak across the street to sit in the center of a clump of trees. She'd look up and imagine what could be, what life would look like if she could live among them.Her Aunt Marilyn saw and appreciated her fascination with discovery. She gave her gifts of tiny boxes that held hidden gems. They were little surprises like pint-sized glass mushrooms she placed along her windowsill, fueling her young imagination.Her aunt died before she was 10, but her spirit still inspired the girl. She was in her 30s when she spotted her first hollow tree, an enormous live oak on a plantation in Charleston, South Carolina. She couldn't help herself and climbed right in. She peered around in wonder and, just as she did decades earlier, dreamt what was possible. \"If this was my tree,\" she remembers thinking, \"this is what I'd do.\"The road to discoveryHere's where we must hit pause. Before you read further, if you haven't already, please watch the video at the top of the article or just below.  Only then will the rest of this piece make sense. And spoiler alert: If you keep reading first, you'll ruin the surprise of the video later. Don't be a gnome-hater. Done watching? Great. Now, let's move on. Last time we saw Robyn Frampton was June 2014. She and her sons were loaded in their white minivan, leaving behind a legacy in Overland Park, Kansas. The whimsy of the Firefly Forest they'd created along a suburban wooded trail captured the imagination of children and adults, drew strangers together in wonderment and comforted a family reeling from grief.Frampton's fairy houses and fanciful tree-hollow homes -- and the effect they had -- were chronicled in \"The Gnomist,\" the critically acclaimed short film that was acquired by CNN Films and featured last month on \"Great Big Story.\"By the end of the film, the evidence of their efforts -- with one exception -- had been removed. The family behind this dreamlike world, a mother and two sons still finding their way after a divorce, uprooted and drove off into the unknown.That was about a year and a half ago. We set out to find Frampton and see what happened next.'Unlike anything I've ever experienced'Saratoga Springs, Utah, is a quiet bedroom community about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. On the morning drive there, sunlight cuts through scattered clouds and the Wasatch Range to the east, the rays twirling in an enchanted dance. The snow-capped mountains loom majestic. We step out of the cold and into the warm home and embrace of the woman we've come to visit: The Gnomist.Tears spring to Frampton's eyes easily. They come when she speaks of the overwhelming reaction to the film, which was released in the hours leading up to the November 13 Paris terrorist attacks.So far, the film has been viewed online about 2 million times. With the world steeped in hatred, filmmaker Sharon Liese says \"The Gnomist\" somehow has emerged as a salve, an uplifting ray of light, a reminder of humanity's goodness.Frampton can hardly believe the standing ovations she's gotten at screenings and can't bear to look up at the masses.\"It all comes at me,\" she says, her eyes welling. \"It's unlike anything I've ever experienced.\"She recalls the strangers who've reached out, including those who've cried on her shoulder. She laughs about the band of \"ninja moms\" she met at the Kansas screening, a group that scoured the trail at night in search of the bandits who were stealing and breaking doors. And she opens up a big box to reveal a homemade fairy house, just sent to her by a young person in Colorado.The attention and adoration both touches and baffles her. She insists that she was only a facilitator in Overland Park. What she did, she says, was as much for herself and her children -- whom she was desperate to shield from the pain of divorce -- as it was for anyone else. Everything that transpired was thanks to others, she says, and a gift to her.\"I was there in chains. I felt like there was no hope for me,\" says Frampton, who hadn't yet finished college and couldn't find work for more than minimum wage. \"The flame that burned inside me, it was taking its last dying breath.\"Hundreds of notes fill a scrapbook she lays out on the floor of her sunny front sitting room in Saratoga Springs. Inside are messages that make her laugh and others that choke her up.Words left for mythical fairies bolstered her, miraculously appearing at just the right times. As she struggled to believe in herself, a child scrawled in red marker, \"I belive [sic] in you.\" When she felt particularly down, a stranger wrote, \"People who take time to bless others are truly special!\"On days when she felt broken or couldn't catch her breath because she was so scared, she'd spot little girls at a fairy house squealing with glee.\"How can that not make you smile?\" she says. \"To see someone delighted, delighted me.\"She learned to remember that she wasn't alone in feeling pain and was reminded that others have it worse.\"I wish I can stay sober for the rest of my life. ... 9 days clean from heroin today,\" wrote one person. \"Please bring mom home safely,\" said another. And then, of course, there was the one remembering Allie \"Little Owl\" Fisher, who died of a rare brain cancer at age 3.Exchanging giftsReproductions of fairy and gnome doors are scattered about Frampton's bright rental home. People request them as artwork and she offers them as gifts. They line the top of a kitchen credenza and lean against the wall by the front door. There's a new one she plans to send to Greg Ruether, the director of parks services who insisted the fairy and gnome homes come down. The poor guy emerged a villain in the film and has endured ugly phone calls and the wrath of audiences. Frampton, however, knows he was working within the confines of his job. She also knows what viewers don't: He agreed to let her keep building until she left Overland Park -- and guarded her secret.The door she's made for him is black. A little window opens to reveal a painted gold heart. Written on the window's door: \"To the ogre with a heart of gold.\"There's also a replica of the only door Frampton left behind in the forest: the turquoise one in honor of \"Little Owl,\" a full-of-life girl gone far too soon.\"The door is still there,\" Kelly Fisher, Allie's mother, says by phone. \"It's weathered. It's beautiful. It's even more beautiful because it's withstood time so well.\"Fisher is now a close friend of Frampton's. Fisher says she, her husband Kyle and their daughter Evie still frequent their door along the trail. It's where they go when they need to feel close to Allie. On the day when Allie should have been starting kindergarten, they went there. Sometimes they still find notes. One recently read, \"Praying for you.\" Another said, \"Hugs.\" And on Mother's Day, a stranger left Fisher a card.\"That door came into my life at my lowest time when I look back on it. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it through this grief,\" she says. \"It continues to bring gifts to our life.\"The experience in Overland Park keeps giving back to Frampton, too.\"It helped me to never forget what I value in myself and what I value in other people,\" she says.She moved to Utah, where she'd lived a few times before, to be near family. Frampton is one of six kids, has two siblings in the state, and her parents -- who divorced when Frampton was 20 -- live here, too.But she also came with a mission to finish college. She's taken on a heavier-than-normal course load at Utah Valley University in nearby Orem. She's working as quickly as she can to earn her bachelor's degree in psychology and will enter her last semester in January.Frampton's overwhelmingly busy. While grateful to be around people who love and support her emotionally, she still worries about finances and what will come next. There are also days when she still feels lost and out of place. Being a divorced Mormon woman in this community, one that is so family-focused, can sometimes be unnerving. She's learned to believe, though, in the journey. She hasn't traveled the road she imagined for herself, but she trusts that she's headed to exactly where she's supposed to be.The magic that remainsFrampton remembers the first time she spotted a hollow tree and thought to herself, \"That tree could use a door.\" It was while walking on a trail in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she lived before moving to Kansas. Hollow trees are hard to come by where she lives now. So, too, are lush wooded neighborhood trails. Utah is a largely defined by desert, after all.But along a path in Dry Creek Trail Park, in nearby Lehi, the fairies and gnomes may be stirring -- this time with the approval of the parks department. A little yellow house sprung up in October atop a stump and nestled against an old tree. Painted inside the two front doors: \"Let your light shine.\"The doors open to a tiny room with a tiny bed and a tiny bedspread. On the floor are emptied little jars labeled \"pixie dust.\" Frampton isn't sure future buildings along this path are the way to go. It's a trial. She can't and won't allow herself to have expectations that this will take off as it did in Overland Park. That was a special time, a special place, and what needed to happen there did.Her sons have moved on. They're focused on school, friends and their own creative experiences. Parker, 16, still plays guitar and is his high school's junior class vice president. Tyler, 14, inspired by the filming of \"The Gnomist,\" has become an amateur filmmaker himself. What transpired in Kansas hasn't left Frampton. How could it?She has teamed up with an illustrator and hopes to self-publish the book she left behind in Overland Park: \"Lost and Found in Firefly Forest.\"And she opens up the door to her garage to reveal her latest secret venture -- one she can only work on sporadically these days. It is her happy place, where she can lose herself in whimsy.An enormous, multi-tiered fairy home, fashioned inside a stump she salvaged from a tree graveyard and hollowed out, towers above her 5-foot-8-inch frame. A green shingled roof tops it. Doors formed from an old whiskey barrel are in place, as are some pieces of furniture, an indoor fireplace and bells for the doors.She learned her way around tools -- axes, chainsaws, grinders -- when she was married and her husband was on the road for work. \"If something needed to be done, I had to do it.\" She constructed forts and castles for kids. She built furniture. She finished a basement.Building, she says, has always made her happy. And when her creations make others happy, there's nothing better.She also likes to repurpose old items. Salvaged wire can be twisted to become furniture. Bins on shelves are full of wood and other scraps just waiting to be transformed.\"Where you come from doesn't have to determine where you're going,\" she says.Come spring, the big house will be installed in a memorial garden at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City and donated, with her friend Kelly Fisher's blessing, by Team Little Owl, the foundation for brain cancer research created in Allie's memory. It will include a mailbox with a special key that will be presented to young patients who will be invited to visit the house to pick up special packages. Frampton can envision a career in organizational psychology. But if she could wave a wand and create her dream job, she'd build these houses for children's hospitals across the nation.Children's hospitals are personal for Frampton, especially the one in Salt Lake City. Both of her sons, when they were much younger, had health scares that landed them there. Parker, as a 3-month-old baby, had to have surgery to separate a prematurely fused skull. And Tyler, before he was 2, was taken by life-flight to the hospital after aspirating on an almond in trail mix.Those scares changed how she looked at the world and how she interacted with other people. She thought more about what she could offer, no matter how small.\"The truth is we're walking around in a world of people looking down and feeling alone,\" she says. \"Part of the human condition is finding connections, whether brief and for a moment or eternal.\"  And on the trails we each travel, the Gnomist says, we carry our own gifts we can share.For more on CNN's Digital Shorts, check out cnn.com/shortfilms.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/12/13/living/gnomist-film-kansas-utah/index.html"}
{"_id":"Meet the man who has dedicated 40 years to crafting art out of hair ","articleText":"Lisa Armstrong is Fashion Director of The Telegraph. This is an edited excerpt from \"Hair by Sam McKnight,\" published by Rizzoli. (CNN)The first rule of show hair: deep breathing. When the designer calls for 60 identical black wigs in the final run-up and you have less than half that number, when a model arrives on her moped from a previous show with hair coiled into tiny braids and you have ten minutes to transform her into an '80s glamazon, when you've spent the last 24 hours dying and cutting those wigs and there are splashes of black splattered across your all-white Milanese suite...Second, third and fourth rules: preparation, preparation, preparation. \"With 40 to 100 girls on the runway, and overlapping schedules, it has to be meticulously planned,\" says Sam McKnight. Picture the scene when the models do arrive -- and the creative choreography that unfolds around them: the makeup artists, the manicurists, the dressers, the stylists, the hairdressers, and the journalists prowling for instant quotes on next season's (make that this season, NOW) trends. It's a different world from his first fashion show -- in 1978 for the Emanuels. \"I think there were four of us in total working on that production, in conditions best described as makeshift.\" These days he travels with a core team of twenty assistants that expands for bigger shows. Ideally he likes to have a discussion with the designer three weeks before. \"It can be relatively specific --Tom Ford saying he wants an L.A. punk look -- or it can be more obscure.\" Vivienne Westwood might email him a portrait of Marie Antoinette, a Victorian child, and an African vase made from Coca-Cola cans in the expectation he'll pull the strands together in a single, exquisite, front-page holding image. And he does. \"The finished results might end up having nothing to do with the original brief. What's helpful is to have a concept you can play with.\" Fendi's fauxhicans were the culmination of a riff that began when Karl Lagerfeld, a long-time collaborator with McKnight, said he wanted to incorporate some fur in the models' hair. A plait turned into the world's chicest feral Mohawks woven with mink.\"They'll add a black eyebrow and you'll think that would look great if the Mohawk was purple... you build, and sometimes you take away.\"But not that often because bold statements work on social media and nowadays, hair is frequently a catalyst for an instant global conversation. When Olivier Rousteing asked McKnight to style Gigi Hadid in a dark wig and Kendall Jenner in a blonde one, the images were bouncing across social media before the show was over. Punks, princesses, pagans -- McKnight has created runway versions of them all, and always found a way to make them look beautiful. Nor is he fazed by today's pace. \"Years ago shows were for press and buyers only. Now they're instant entertainment. Our work has become much more accessible.\" He likes that, too. As much as he loves an historical allusion, relishes research, and understands the cultural complexities of hair, he's just as happy creating simple, mussed up bedhead that any woman can copy—if she has 40 years experience and magic hands. In McKnight's world, simple is never that simple.Watch the video above to find out more about Sam McKnight and his new exhibition, \"Hair by Sam McKnight\"","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/fashion/sam-mcknight-hair-somerset-house-exhibition/index.html"}

His nonprofit, ASODISVALLE, offers young people with disabilities a range of free services, including medical care, physical therapy and healthy meals.\"The most special thing about the foundation is the love and care that we give to the children,\" Aristizábal said. \"We fight for their happiness.\"Learn more about Jeison Aristizábal's work.Craig DodsonCraig Dodson was a semi-professional cyclist in 2005 when he was asked to speak to a group of students in Richmond, Virginia. He later learned that many in the crowd lived in one of the city's roughest housing projects. Inspired to help, Dodson founded the Richmond Cycling Corps in 2010, a nonprofit that coaches cycling teams for at-risk children. For Dodson, cycling is a way into their lives and a path out of the projects. \"We are like the Navy SEALs,\" Dodson said. \"We have to infiltrate and be there for every part of their life.\"Learn more about Craig Dodson's work.Sherri FranklinSherri Franklin poured her lifelong passion for animals into volunteer work at the San Francisco humane society.

To save them, Franklin started Muttville out of her home, a nonprofit that rescues and finds homes for senior dogs -- more than 4,000 so far.  \"It is not about the quantity of time, it really is about the quality of time you spend with your animal,\" Franklin said.Learn more about Sherri Franklin's work.Brad LuddenAt age 18, Brad Ludden had already completed nearly 100 \"first descents\" -- kayak trips down a section of river no one has paddled before. After watching his aunt battle cancer when she was 38, Ludden started First Descents, a nonprofit that brings these once-in-a-lifetime experiences to young adults battling the disease -- with more than 3,000 participants to date. \"It's that important reminder that this life, it's really fleeting,\" Ludden said. \"With that knowledge, we have this obligation to go out and live as fully as possible.\"Learn more about Brad Ludden's work.Luma MuflehLuma Mufleh founded a soccer program and school through her organization, the Fugees Family, to address the unique needs of the refugee community in Clarkston, Georgia. Last spring, the Fugees Academy graduated its first class, and Mufleh's group has helped more than 800 refugee children. \"It's getting people from all over the world, from all different faiths, to come together to do something great,\" Mufleh said.Learn more about Luma Mufleh's work.Umra OmarUmra Omar left a career in the United States to help people without any access to health care in her homeland of Kenya. Omar founded Safari Doctors, a group that travels by boat, road and air to bring free medical services to more than 1,000 people a year in remote and insecure areas near the Somalia border. \"Being here, being close to home, to be able to fill some of the gaps in accessing health care, it's kind of been an IV drip for life and purpose,\" Omar said.Learn more about Umra Omar's work.Georgie Smith Los Angeles County has the country's largest foster youth population, and when they age out of the system, they're often left on their own.After seeing this first-hand, designer and chef Georgie Smith founded the nonprofit A Sense of Home, which provides comfortable living spaces for former foster youth. \"By setting up their first home, it gives them the foundation from which they can succeed,\" Smith said.Learn more about Georgie Smith's work.Sheldon Smith Like nearly half of all African-American children in the U.S., Sheldon Smith grew up with an absentee father. Serving prison time for robbery scared Smith straight and inspired him to stay in his child's life and encourage others to do the same. Smith started the Dovetail Project, which teaches young fathers the life skills necessary to become responsible parents and positive role models. \"My goal when I started the Dovetail Project was to break the cycle,\" Smith said.Learn more about Sheldon Smith's work.Becca StevensNearly twenty years ago, Becca Stevens, an episcopal priest, set out to help the women of Nashville who have been scarred by prostitution, addiction and trafficking. Today, her nonprofit, Thistle Farms, runs five residential communities in Nashville, providing women a place to stay for two years, medical care, counseling and other services -- all for free. \"None of the women ended up on the streets by themselves. And so it makes sense that it takes a community to welcome them home,\" Stevens said.Learn more about Becca Stevens' work.Harry SwimmerAn encounter with a girl named Stacy changed Harry Swimmer's life. Stacy has cerebral palsy, and meeting her gave Swimmer an idea: What would happen if he put Stacy on a horse? \"[S]he just lit up like a candle.\" Soon after, Swimmer retired and transformed his horse farm into a sanctuary for children with disabilities. Since 1988, his organization, Mitey Riders, has provided more than 800 children with free equine-assisted therapy.Learn more about Harry Swimmer's work.As part of the award package, each Top 10 Hero will also receive free organizational training from the Annenberg Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide.

{"_id":"Memories of boyhood in the heat of the Cuban revolution","articleText":"This story was originally published in 2009. (CNN)I was 5 years old and my dad and I were on our way to the neighborhood bakery to buy a loaf of bread. It was early on the morning of January 1, 1959. A stranger stopped us on the deserted street right outside our second-floor apartment.\"Did you hear?\" he asked. \"Batista is gone.\"Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled the country in the middle of the night. Fidel Castro would soon be in power.Not many people can remember details from when they were 5 years old. But not many people have lived through what I did in the late 1950s. Conversations with my parents have refreshed those memories.I remember a sense of surprise and excitement that morning, tinged with fear and uncertainty.My dad says I was tranquil and quiet.\"Let's go back upstairs,\" he said after hearing the news.\"Yes, let's go, Papi,\" my dad quoted me as saying.Back in our apartment, we tuned the radio to a local station, which confirmed the news.My mother insisted we stay inside, saying there would be trouble. Indeed, a short while later, we heard loud gunshots as rebels hunted down Batista officials and supporters door-to-door.That night, someone went up to our building's rooftop patio, looking for a Batista supporter. Two shots rang out. I cringed, squatting next to a wall. I remember the terror I felt.That was the day the revolution triumphed. In two short years, Fidel Castro and his ragtag band of rebels had done what many considered impossible.They would soon march triumphantly down the spine of Cuba from their rebel stronghold in Oriente Province on the eastern end of the island to Havana to assume power.A revolution and refugeesFifty years later, Castro, his younger brother Raul and other revolutionaries are still there -- but not so for the millions of Cubans who have fled to the United States and elsewhere.Twenty-one months after that morning when we heard the news, my family and I would be among those refugees.It is fair to say that few Cubans who lived through the revolution expected that outcome. Castro had been hugely popular and widely seen as a savior who would deliver Cuba from 50 years of dictatorships and unstable governments. He had promised free elections and a return to constitutional government.The highly unpopular and much-feared Batista had been a major player in Cuban politics since 1933, when he and a group of low-ranking army officials took control of the government.A power-broker, Batista effectively ruled behind the scenes until he was elected president in 1940. He held power until 1944, when he was defeated for re-election.Batista did not go away quietly. He was elected to the Senate in 1948 and was running for president in 1952 when he staged a coup after it looked like he wouldn't win.Ruthless and dictatorial, he ruled with a bloody iron fist.Fidel Castro, meanwhile, had been a student leader at the University of Havana in the late 1940s, heavily involved in the violent and passionate Cuban politics.On July 26, 1953, he and a group of about 100 followers attacked the military Moncada Barracks in the eastern city of Santiago.The attack failed miserably and about half of the insurgents were killed. Castro fled to the nearby Sierra Maestra mountains, but was captured a short while later.While on trial in late 1953, he gave his famous \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech in which he said, \"Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me.\"Pardoned under a general amnesty in 1955, Castro fled to Mexico, where he continued to plot against Batista. He formed the 26th of July Movement, named for the date of the Moncada Barracks attack, and gathered money and support. It was there that Castro met a man who would become a revolutionary legend, the Argentinean Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.In late November 1956, the rebels set sail from Veracruz aboard an old yacht named \"Granma.\" Castro and his group of less than 100 followers landed a week later in eastern Cuba, where most of them were caught or killed.Castro, his brother Raul and Guevara were among the handful who escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains, where Castro had sought refuge after his disastrous Moncada attack three years earlier.The rebel leader won popular support among the peasants in his remote hideaway while urban dissidents sowed insurrection in the cities.Adopting guerrilla warfare tactics, Castro and his followers were able to inflict stinging defeats on Batista's army, which was mostly composed of young, untrained and unmotivated soldiers.My mother, father, new baby brother and I lived in Santiago during the revolution, near the Sierra Maestra.From a vantage point in the city, we could see Batista's planes bombing the rebel strongholds in the distance.We would see Batista's armed troop convoys leaving their garrisons in the morning, heading for the jungle of the mountains.There were whispered comments among Cubans that the ambulances full of dead and wounded soldiers were returning under cover of darkness in the middle of the night.Robbed of a normal childhoodWhat happened during the revolution registered strongly on a young boy who was robbed of a normal childhood, but who grew up witnessing history outside his front door.I remember my dad coming home from work one day with a bullet hole in his car from a stray shot.I remember heading to the beach one day along a country road outside Santiago and my dad unsuccessfully trying to push my head down in the back seat so I couldn't see the body lying next to the highway, barbed wire strung around the man's neck.I remember looking out the second-floor balcony of an apartment we previously lived in and seeing a car full of young men chasing a screaming woman down the middle of the street. The men's arms stretched out of the windows as they pointed weapons at the woman.The woman and the men disappeared from view, blocked by the corner of the building, so I never knew what happened to her.That day, a major shoot-out broke out in the plaza in front of our apartment and my mother and I hugged the floor for safety. She crawled into the kitchen and got me a small glass of wine, which she had me drink so I would fall asleep. When I woke, there was quiet -- but no peace.Another day, a car with four Batista secret police pulled up downstairs and the men got out, leaving the doors open and the engine running. They went into the business downstairs, searching for a Castro supporter. I don't know what happened there, either.I remember a few days after the announcement of Batista's defeat, Castro started his procession down from the mountains and along Cuba's central highway to the capital, Havana. My parents were thinking about going down to watch the triumphant parade, but I asked that we not. I was scared of what might happen.A few days later, I remember watching our console black-and-white TV as Castro gave his first speech before tens of thousands in Havana. I don't remember his words, but I do remember a white dove that perched on his shoulder as Camilo Cienfuegos, a major revolutionary leader and cohort, stood by his side.Every once in a while, Castro would stop and turn to Cienfuegos and ask him, \"Voy bien, Camilo?\" Am I doing OK, Camilo? And Cienfuegos would answer, \"Vas bien, Fidel.\"Ten months later, Cienfuegos' plane disappeared over the ocean during a flight to Havana, and the whispering started. Although it is widely held that Cienfuegos perished in an accident, many Cubans started saying privately that Castro or his brother Raul had him taken out over political differences or because of a perceived threat from the charismatic revolutionary known for wearing a wide-brimmed hat.To this day, the Castros continue to pay homage to Cienfuegos. An official logo for the 50th anniversary of the revolution bears a drawing of Castro and Cienfuegos.And to this day, I remember the day 50 years ago that began with a journey for a loaf of bread that would change my life and that of so many others forever.

{"_id":"Mesmerizing photos of abandoned structures","articleText":" (CNN)The derelict is not the first thing that most people would choose to study, but neglected and rotting structures are photographer Brian Precious Decay's specialty. A 40-year old executive at a transport company by day, he visits abandoned buildings in his spare time -- from sorry-looking children's camps and vacant hospitals to run-down castles -- creating haunting images of places reduced to just a shadow of their former selves.Precious Decay is a pseudonym, but the photographer has asked not to reveal his real name because what he does may be considered trespassing. The interest in all things abandoned was spurred by his hometown of Rotterdam, which was almost completely destroyed during World War II. A photography course in 2010 then set the wheels in motion.  Read: Lose yourself in the world's most impressive labyrinths and mazesWhile there is a melancholic beauty his work, he readily admits that his style is niche and not something most people would want to place on their living room wall. Here, he discusses how to find appeal in unexpected places.How do you scout locations? It's really a way of life because you have to look on Google Earth to search for areas where you see the grass has not been mowed. You check the newspapers for messages for hospitals that are out of use. It takes a lot of time, and I have two small kids and a family. It takes a lot of money. Read: Is this the most beautiful way to burn trash?In the Netherlands, where I live, buildings that are abandoned get boarded up. Belgium is a two-hour drive from my home, but you can also go to France, Germany, Austria and further and further. Hotels and plane tickets add up. What region have you found to be the most fertile for abandoned sites?The former East Germany, which used to be divided by the Berlin Wall. There are a lot of abandoned buildings there. Also, in the skiing areas in the Czech Republic or in Germany. At one point people went skiing and hotels popped up, but when people went elsewhere they had to close down. In Austria, there's a ski town that's almost completely abandoned. Read: How architecture shaped Fire Island PinesThe Netherlands doesn't really have castles like they do in Italy and Poland. They cost a lot of money and, especially when they deteriorate, renovation costs are pretty high. The renovation costs are then higher than the worth of the buildings, so then it just keeps on deteriorating. Even demolishing is more expensive than leaving it to rot.   Do you often run into obstacles while photographing derelict structures?Normally, if they see us with a camera they think we're okay. We're not destroying stuff.  I want to shoot pictures of how I found it. If I start moving stuff then you get a staged living room. It's not real. We usually go early in the morning when the sun is just coming up and everyone is sleeping. If there's a gate, we may climb over the gate or we find a hole in the gate. We don't break stuff. The worse thing the police can say is delete your pictures but that's it. It's a bit of a thrill. Read: Archeologists unearth 3000-year-old communityWhat is your most memorable shoot? There was a big castle in Belgium. We'd been there several times, but we could never find an entry. As a rule, we don't break in. It should be open or else you don't enter. We went at five in the morning. We took pictures. There was a Jeep circling around the castle continuously. We thought this was not good, but we continued because nobody called us. We thought we needed to step out and the police showed up. They asked us what we're doing here. They checked what was in our car and that no stuff was taken in our bags. Read: 17 Le Corbusier works join UNESCO World Heritage ListSo we went to the police station, got mugshots, but they let us leave. Once we stepped out, we had a beer but then chose to go to a factory nearby to photograph some more. What do you find beautiful about decay?The history of the place, definitely. Nature taking over too. Sometimes you see a roof collapsed and moss growing on the floor. If you leave it as it is, a tree will grow in the house, and things like that are what fascinates people, I think.I don't see it as negative. Decay can be very beautiful but it's personal. A lot of people like the pictures because it raises questions but to hang it on your living room wall, that's another question. This interview has been edited for clarity.

Be calm, don't fall into provocation and don't be fooled. The government of (Enrique) Peña Nieto and the Mexican people are with you,\" the government said on Wednesday in its 11-point plan meant to support the Mexican community living in the United States.The plan does not appear to mention Trump by name.Mexico pulls trigger on Trump 'contingency plan'The announcement comes after the US President-elect kicked off his campaign by promising to \"build a great wall\" and have Mexico pay for it. He also called some Mexicans \"rapists,\" and added, \"Some, I assume, are good people.\"In a meeting earlier in his campaign, Peña Nieto and Trump disputed who would pay for the wall --  Trump claimed payment was not discussed; Peña Nieto said he made it clear to Trump that Mexico would not be responsible.\"The Mexican people have felt hurt by the comments that have been made,\" the President of Mexico said after their meeting in September. \"But I am sure that his genuine interest is to build a relationship that will give both of our society's better welfare.\"Mexico has said it was preparing a contingency plan to deal with Trump's promise of mass deportations, a border wall and renegotiation of NAFTA.On Thursday, the Mexican central bank took another measure to brace for life under Trump: Banxico announced it will increase a key interest rate as the peso continues to falls under Trump's win. Mexico's economy, which has already been slowing, prepares for an even deeper slump.For its citizens abroad, the Foreign Ministry released a video titled \"We are with you,\" a slogan intended to calm deportation fears and protect citizen's from becoming victims of possible abuse and fraud. \"We want to inform you on the possible immigration actions and in regards to your belongings that might be affected starting February,\" Claudia Ruiz Massieu, secretary of external relations, says in the video. \"We are going to get this information to you and deliver services to you wherever you might be. You can also go to the consulate or call us.\"A toll-free number has been created by the Center for Information and Assistance to Mexicans (CIAM), which is free for Mexican immigrants living abroad. The hotline will be available 24 hours a day in order to assist anyone with information, migration issues, and even to report any incidents that might occur.Mexico announced that it has instructed its consulates to step up assistance for immigrants. Hours are expected to be extended to accommodate the high number of cases. Apps for mobile phones, more consulate presence and 'intensifying' birth certificate registrations for children born in the US are also in the plan.\"We will be more close to you than ever before,\" the video goes on to say. Opinion: Trump win a headache for MexicoBut while the fear is increasing with immigrants living in the United States, the number of those attempting to cross the border continues to increase. Among them are Central Americans from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador trying to flee violence and poverty.Jim Darling, the mayor of McAllen, Texas, says the surge of border crossings is a result of Trump's pledge to build a wall. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said apprehensions along the southwest border were up nearly 17% in October. The agency sent 150 more agents to the border to handle the influx.Trump's calls for deporting all undocumented workers and plans to build a wall along the border earned him withering criticism from Peña Nieto, as well as many independents and moderate Republicans.But the calls were central pillars of his campaign, galvanizing his white, working-class base.At a postelection victory party in New York, however, Trump said, \"I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.\"There was no immediate comment on Mexico's 11-point plan from Trump's transition team.

Luis Felipe Puente, Mexico's director of civil protection, shared photos and videos on social media of the plume spreading through the sky. Authorities warned people to stay away from the volcano, particularly its crater. It's likely ash will fall in nearby towns, officials said. Already, ash has fallen in two municipalities in Puebla state, Felipe said.The volcano erupted in April, spewing smoke, ash and lava. Popocatépetl is one of an estimated 1,500 potentially active volcanoes.

Authorities are still combing the area to see whether there are more hidden graves at the site, the statement said. The investigation began earlier this week after authorities, acting on a tip, found a man who'd been kidnapped and held captive at a drug gang's camp.

They found a cooler with human remains inside, several abandoned vehicles and AK-47 and AR-15 ammunition clips.By Thursday, the tally had grown to 32 bodies found in at least 17 graves.The discovery comes amid a surge in violence in the state, where vigilante groups have also grown as some citizens take security into their own hands.Local media reported that there's a turf war between rival drug gangs in the region where the bodies were found.\"Here, there is a phenomenon,\" Guerrero Coordinating Group spokesman Robert Alvarez Heredia told MVS Radio this week. \"The large cartels have become small criminal gangs, and they share one characteristic: the extreme and irrational use of violence.\"On Friday, officials said they were stepping up security and sending more federal police forces to the state \"to protect citizens who have nothing to do with the confrontations between criminal groups.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/americas/mexico-bodies-found/index.html"}

{"_id":"Michael Flynn ran company that lobbied for foreign clients while he received intel briefings","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's preferred choice for National Security Adviser, was running a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings during the campaign.The revelation comes as the Trump camp has taken a series steps to curb the involvement of lobbyists in the presidential transition efforts. Robert Kelley, a former chief counsel to the House National Security Subcommittee and current general counsel and principal at the Flynn Intel Group, filed a lobbying disclosure report with Congress on September 15.According to the official document, Kelley was working on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin.Alptekin told CNN in an email that the firm works to strengthen \"the transatlantic relationship and Turkey's future in that alliance.\"Kelley's connection to the Flynn Intel Group and Alptekin were first reported in the Daily Caller. Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Trump transition chair Mike Pence expressing concerns over Flynn's \"apparent conflict of interest.\"\"President-elect Trump promised during his campaign that he would 'drain the swamp,' but his top national security advisor is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose firm is reportedly being paid to lobby the U.S. Government by a close ally of Turkey's president,\" the Maryland Democrat wrote. \"It is unclear how Lt. Gen. Flynn was reportedly allowed into intelligence briefings during the campaign despite these apparent conflicts of interest.\"Trump's transition responded to questions about the lobbying effort with a statement Friday, saying that Flynn's career was within his right as a \"private citizen.\" \"After devoting his life to serving his country, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn became a private citizen and opened a private consulting business to advise companies on various issues. Gen. Flynn has said that he will sever ties to his consulting firm if he ever returned to government service and that is what he will do in the Trump Administration.\" Alptekin is the chair of the Turkish-American Business Council and helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan's 2015 visit to Washington.But while Alptekin acknowledged having a commercial relationship with the Flynn Intel Group, he told CNN that Flynn himself \"does not work on my contract.\"He also adamantly denied any connection to the Turkish government.\"Neither Inovo, any of my other companies or my person are affiliated to the Turkish government in any form whatsoever,\" he said. He added that his company's contract with Flynn's company \"is not about representing the position of the Government of Turkey\"However, the fact that Flynn was overseeing a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients at the same time he was attending classified briefings alongside Trump seems to complicate the transition, especially given Trump's stated goal of \"draining the swamp\" in Washington.Flynn, who as America's top military intelligence officer was already privy to volumes of classified material, is obligated to not share that information with any outside entity.While Flynn had the highest level of clearance while serving as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, experts on security clearances told CNN that his firm's business arrangements with foreign companies would be closely looked at by background investigators before Flynn could receive additional intelligence briefings in his new role.\"They would certainly look at it carefully,\" Sean Bigley, a security clearance lawyer and former government background investigator told CNN.Although Bigley said there was no restriction on someone like Flynn working for foreign companies upon leaving office he said Flynn would have to inform background investigators of these business relationships in order to be able to continue to receive classified briefings.But other lawyers specializing in security clearance issues said Flynn simply informing investigators of his company's ties to Inovo might not protect him from having his security clearance revoked.Bradley Moss, an attorney who routinely represents defense contractors in security clearance disputes, said Flynn's actions would likely raise a red flag.  Flynn's lobbying work, according to Moss, could potentially jeopardize his ability to get cleared as national security advisor.\"Security adjudicators would have concerns that someone with Flynn's level of experience wouldn't think twice about sitting in on a classified briefing while working for foreign clients,\" Moss said. \"The moment he sat in on classified briefings, his association with his own company had to be severed.\" \"By not doing that he exposed himself unnecessarily to foreign influence and raised questions about his good judgment,\" Moss added. Asked about Flynn's business dealings, CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday that that type of work was not unusual and that his activities should not prevent him from taking on the role of national security advisor. \"I don't think those should be a bar to duty,\" he said. But while he said his business relationships were not disqualifying, Mudd, a former CIA analyst, said Flynn's temperament would not serve him well in the role. The intelligence briefs containing some classified were first given to both candidates in August and Flynn accompanied Trump during at least one brief. It is unclear if Flynn informed investigators of his company's ties to Inovo. His representatives did not reply to a request for comment.Flynn told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to officially join the Trump administration he would sever ties with his company, which is described as providing \"all source intelligence support to global challenges.\"\"If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump,\" he said. Flynn's connection to Turkey drew scrutiny after he penned an Election Day op-ed in The Hill newspaper, which said the US should extradite the exiled cleric Fetullah Gulen to Turkey.The Turkish government has accused Gulen of being behind the July coup and has demanded the US hand him over. The Justice Department is currently reviewing the case for extradition.But Alptekin said he and his company had nothing to do with Flynn's op-ed.\"If he had asked me whether to publish it, I would have advised against it for a variety of reasons,\" he said.

Michael Flynn regularly shares conspiracy theories, expletive-filled posts, and racially insensitive sentiments on Twitter and Facebook, a CNN KFile review of his social media presence reveals.Flynn's son, Michael G. Flynn, shared stories alleging top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had a connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, pushed a conspiracy theory that Sen. Marco Rubio was a closeted homosexual who abused cocaine, and repeatedly used expletives to attack Trump's political opponents. The retired general has been offered the role of national security advisor, a transition official told CNN Thursday. The younger Flynn serves as his father's chief of staff and top aide, attending events alongside his father and working for his father's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group. The elder Flynn credited his son with editing his book and frequently tags his son in tweets. In a photo on Facebook, the younger Flynn can be seen walking with Trump backstage.A request for comment sent to Flynn and his son, as well as a spokesperson, was not returned. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign also did not return a request for comment. The younger Flynn, whose Twitter and Facebook are largely dedicated to supporting Trump, has occasionally shared racially insensitive sentiments.In a tweet from January of this year, Flynn responded to a Vox story on Twitter about whites-only dating sites, writing, \"@voxdotcom soooo African Americans can have B.E.T. but whites can't have their own dating site? Hmmm...\" (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.)After the 2012 election, Flynn tweeted that minorities only voted for President Barack Obama because of his skin color.\"Unfortunately, only reason minorities voted for BO is the color of his skin and NOT for the issues....#Election2012,\" Flynn wrote. (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.)Flynn frequently shares unfounded conspiracy theories, like ones claiming Hillary Clinton and President Obama would be tried for treason if Trump is elected. He also posted a unfounded story claiming hackers would release a video of former President Bill Clinton raping a teenage girl.  In one post, he called alt-right social commentator Mike Cernovich, who frequently shares unfounded news stories, \"a source I trust.\"In a Facebook post from October, Flynn shared a fake news story claiming Obama flaunted an erection to female reporters in 2008.Flynn tweeted multiple times unfounded claims about Sen. Marco Rubio's \"coke house, gayish dance troupe, and foam parties.\" These tweets included a baseless article about Rubio being a homosexual who lived in a drug house and went to \"foam parties\" where \"mutual masturbation is an occasional component, generally beneath the cover of foam.\" On Twitter, the younger Flynn frequently re-tweets Paul Watson, editor for the conspiracy website InfoWars, sometimes using the hashtag \"#infowars\" himself. His Facebook and Twitter picture are him in an InfoWars t-shirt. In one tweet, Flynn retweeted Watson sharing a video of a woman crying saying \"I need an ambulance\" because Trump was elected. Watson commented he thought it \"might be the best thing ever.\" Flynn is also a frequent retweeter of members of the so-called alt-right, retweeting links to videos that discuss whether Clinton campaign chair John Podesta had a \"torture chamber\" and videos claiming Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi terrorists. He has used the word \"cuck\" — a shorthand slur for cuck-conservative which combines the word cuckold and conservative — a number of times on social media. Flynn also regularly labels Hillary Clinton, Saturday Night Live, CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders, President Obama, and others as communists. He labeled Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg socialists in a Facebook post, saying they promote anti-Trump  and pro-Hillary views. In another post on Facebook, he called Gloria Allred, an attorney for many of the women who accused Trump of sexual assault, \"a commie\" who was trying to \"get the heat off the witch.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/kfile-michael-flynn-social-media/index.html"}
{"_id":"Michael Flynn, on trip to Russia, said 'who knows' whether Syria gas attack was a 'false flag'","articleText":" (CNN)During a 2015 trip to Russia, Donald Trump's pick to be national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, said he didn't know whether the 2013 sarin gas attack in Syria was conducted by the Syrian Army or by other forces in an attempt to draw the United States into the conflict.Flynn not ruling out the possibility of a \"false flag\" attack raises questions about how the Trump administration will approach the Syrian conflict.  The Obama administration, the Arab League, NATO, and many western governments have pointed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime as being responsible for the attack. A United Nations investigation didn't assign blame, but evidence from the report pointed to the Assad regime being responsible. Assad's regime and Russian President Vladimir Putin claim opposition forces were behind the attack.Flynn, who was the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Obama administration at the time of the 2013 attack, made the remarks during a December 2015 question and answer session hosted by the Russian government-funded television network, Russia Today. At the event, Flynn was asked by an audience member his take on reports the attack was carried out by Turkish intelligence and made to look like it was the Syrian government, otherwise known as a \"false flag\" operation. \"I'm going to address your question because it's a good question,\" Flynn said. \"It's an interesting one. What keeps me up at night is the use of chemicals and biological weapons by terrorist groups that have the intent, they have the intellect, they don't necessarily have the specific types of capabilities just yet, but I believe that they will have the ability to get their hands on them. I think that all of us globally need to really pay very close attention to that.\" \"Your specific question, I really don't know,\" Flynn said. \"I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I know. To have that level of knowledge or insight or detail of what an intelligence service is doing to do a false flag -- who knows. I don't have a good answer for you. I'm not able to answer your specific question.\"In a 2013 op-ed in the New York Times, Putin wrote, \"No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists.\"The questioner's claim might be grounded in a 2013 article by journalist Seymour Hersh in the London Review of Books, which claimed the jihadist rebel group al-Nusra was behind the attack. The New Yorker and Washington Post both declined to publish the report, saying it didn't meet their standards. A follow up report from Hersh claimed the Turkish government supplied the chemical weapons for the attack.Emails to Flynn and spokespeople for the Trump transition team were not returned. Flynn told the Washington Post this year he was paid through his speaking agency for the appearance at the RT event. At the 2015 dinner for RT's anniversary, Flynn was seated at the same table as Putin.Before the panel, Flynn tweeted, \"Regarding RT panel participation: know my values and beliefs are mine & won't change because I'm on a different piece of geography.\"At the event, Flynn cautioned the situation on the ground in Syria was complex and deception was being use.\"What I know is that the complexity of the situation on the ground right now is beyond anybody's wildest imagination,\" he said. \"[The panel moderator] highlighted it in one of her questions. I think her question was a very good one. It's all of the things that are happening, not just in Syria. This is happening in the region in a big way. The things that you're talking about, there's this tit-for-tat or there's this give and take. People are doing things. There is deception being used.\" \"There is false information being used,\" he added. \"This slide that I have up here is a component of that false information or how false information is applied. We have to understand -- this is why I think [the panel moderator is] driving me crazy up here, trying to get me to be more specific because right now we do have to be more specific.

{"_id":"Michael Pollan really wants you to cook","articleText":" (CNN)Michael Pollan has one request: Can we please get back in the kitchen?In his recently released Netflix series, \"Cooked,\" Pollan tells the story of cooking and how it makes us uniquely human.\"When we learned to cook is when we became truly human,\" he says.The four-part series is full of beautiful images of exotic locales and families gathering, and close-ups of lovingly prepared meats and breads. It's based on the four classicial elements: fire, water, earth, air. Pollan points out that each is a method of cooking.Pollan has long been a proselytizer of the local food movement. In his books \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" \"In Defense of Food\" and \"Cooked,\" which the Netflix series is based on, Pollan argues that knowing where our food comes from is vital to our very existence. In the series, Pollan points to the Martu people of Australia. When they moved away from their traditional aboriginal diets toward a more Westernized one, their incidences of heart disease, cholesterol and obesity rose. One of the Martu women profiled says, \"Sugar made us weak.\" Pollan says that it is a matter of health to understand where our food is from. In the series, he argues we've ceded control of that to large corporations, especially as women entered the work force. While there has been a slight increase in men cooking at home, women are still the dominant force in the kitchen. Since 1965, the amount of time spent preparing food has been cut nearly in half, from 112 minutes a day to 65 minutes a day.\"You have an industry that is trying to undermine cooking as an everyday practice,\" he says. In fact, one study found that half of all calories consumed by children at home come from fast food.But for many of us, the reality of having the time to make our food, let alone know where it comes from, can seem like an out-of-touch luxury. Pollan agrees that we have less and less time, but he also says we haven't made food a priority and have let the food industry dupe us into thinking that cooking is difficult. CNN had a chance to talk with Pollan -- in just about as much time as he had to make a quick meal -- about the challenges of truly knowing our food and making time in the kitchen. This is an edited version of that conversation. CNN: How do you reconcile living the fast-paced life that we live and finding the time to cook? Pollan: It's complicated, but it isn't all or nothing. It's not about cooking every single night of the week. ... I hope that if you're cooking two nights a week, you can try for three. As a culture, we have fought for money in our fair labor movement, instead of time. In Europe, they have fought for time. So our priority has been having money, and then using the money to, in effect, buy time. And maybe that was a mistake. Maybe we should be out there fighting for more time. There are things that the food industry could do to make it easier to cook, like meal kit companies (such as Blue Apron, Plated and HelloFresh). I don't know if that solves the problem. For some people it does, and for some it may be an entry drug. But at least it gets them started. It would be great if you can go to your corner store and buy things that can help with the setup, like pre-cut onions, carrots, and celery. That would take lot of time off the process. I think it's worth encouraging people to take stock of their time. We've figured out how to get two more days a week to be online every year, yet the day is still 24 hours. So we've decided that we are less important. But this is really important, and maybe this activity should compete with some of our online time.CNN: We watch cooking shows on TV where they're making things into foams. Chefs are celebrities. Cooking is really removed from most people's kitchen.  Pollan: We are trying to shift that image of cooking, from something that is new and elite to something that is universal and part of human life. French cooking is really the result of peasants figuring out how to extract flavor from pedestrian ingredients. So most of the food that we think of as elite didn't start out that way. Some of it has become fetishism -- \"This is beyond my reach, skills or time.\" We hope to question that and realize that we have everything that we need to cook. Yes, you have to make time, but not as much as you think. It's not any more than if you go to the restaurant. You can make real food in 20, 30 minutes, but we've convinced ourselves that it is a rocket science. It's a shame. It's the media, and the food industry, they've fed our panic around time. CNN: The industrialized, fast-food system we live in isn't going away. Is there a way to operate in that system but still make healthier, better food? Pollan: There are some new concepts that I hope will bear fruit. But I think it boils down to that they don't have to cook badly. But I think if they are making food to last a shelf life of six months, then it's not going to be good. But you see there are ways to do fast food concepts where they're not just microwaving and reheating. And that's all helpful for dealing with the time-strapped. But even then, you still miss certain things, you miss the satisfaction that comes with cooking, that sense of accomplishment. It feels really good to put a meal on your table. Amazing things follow. But when we stop cooking, that falls apart. People tend to eat more separately. There's a social dimension that goes beyond the nutritional dimension. There's everything you learn when you engage in nature. When you cook, you get to shop. You get to vote if you want the pastured raised pork or the organic grain. You can get to help produce your agricultural system, and you give that up when you outsource your cooking. You become dependent on what's offered -- and that's a shame.  There's a lot of good reasons to cook. We want to shift the balance a bit by inspiring. Cooking is really fun and interesting and all that flows from it is at the core of who we are. CNN: You have 15 minutes to get a meal on the table. What do you make? Pollan: I always have boxed, dried, whole grain pasta. I always have frozen spinach in the freezer. And I always have Parmesan cheese. What I will do is boil some water and then microwave the spinach partially. Once the water is boiling I add the pasta. While the pasta is cooking, I sautee the spinach with some garlic and add some red pepper flakes. Put the greens over the pasta, and add some Parmesan, and that's a pretty great meal, and you can do that in 20 minutes or less. If you want you can add some canned salmon on top -- it's still quasi-industrial, but it's far better than a frozen lasagna, and half the amount of sodium.

{"_id":"Michigan cop dies after he was shot in the head","articleText":" (CNN)A Wayne State University police officer died Wednesday from a gunshot wound he suffered the previous night in Detroit, according to the university president.Officer Collin Rose, 29, had been on life support after he was shot in the head during a police stop.\"This is a tragedy felt by all of us,\" university President M. Roy Wilson said in a statement. \"Please keep Collin and his fiancée and family in your thoughts and prayers. Collin served Wayne State with distinction, and we owe those he left behind our deepest sympathies and our strong support.\"He was the first Wayne State University officer to die on the job, and the fifth police officer shot in the United States in less than a week. A suspect, whom police also described as a person of interest, is in custody but has not been charged, according to university police Chief Anthony Holt. Rose was on a neighborhood patrol near the Wayne State University campus, which has recently seen a rash of auto crimes. He saw a subject on a bike approach the area, and he called for backup, Holt said. When the backup officer arrived, he found Rose with a gunshot wound to the head. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear.\"I can't sugarcoat this,\" Wilson said at a press conference after the shooting. \"This is a tragedy of immense proportions, something that Wayne State fortunately rarely has to experience.\"The person in custody is being held on outstanding misdemeanor warrants, one from 2011 and another from 2014, according to Holt.Wayne State University police encountered the suspect a few years ago. In one incident, the suspect was blocking traffic in the middle of the street and refused to leave. There was a scuffle with police, and one of the officers involved suffered minor injuries, according to Holt.Working on a master's; was to be marriedRose was a five-year veteran of the police force and worked as a canine officer.\"Not only is he a canine handler, he's very, very involved in the community. He goes to schools. He gives out demos,\" Holt said. \"He's just an outstanding, proactive officer.\"A couple of months ago, Rose organized a memorial for slain Detroit police Officer Patrick Hill. Rose named one of his dogs, Wolverine, after Hill, according to Holt. Rose was one credit away from finishing his master's degree in police administration from Wayne State University. He was engaged to be married in October 2017.The gun used to shoot Rose hasn't been found. The Detroit office for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is offering a $5,000 reward to anyone with information regarding the weapon.This shooting comes after a violent few days for police officers across the country. On Sunday night, four officers were shot while on duty, one fatally.

{"_id":"Michigan to move ahead with presidential recount","articleText":" (CNN)Michigan will become the second state to conduct a recount of ballot casts during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith early Monday morning issued an order for Michigan election officials to begin counting ballots starting at noon. The ruling follows a request from Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein after a razor-thin margin made the state the last to be called in the November election. President-elect Donald Trump ended up winning Michigan's 16 electoral votes by just 0.2 percentage points, or just under 10,000 votes out of over 5.5 million cast.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, last week filed a lawsuit to stop the recount.\"It is inexcusable for Stein to put Michigan voters at risk of paying millions and potentially losing their voice in the Electoral College in the process,\" Schuette said in a statement.Stein has spearheaded a recount effort in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three battleground states where Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton. Trump supporters in Wisconsin have unsuccessfully tried to stop the recount in progress there. Stein's campaign, who withdrew a recount request in a Pennsylvania state court, this weekend said she would instead file the lawsuit seeking a statewide recount in federal court Monday morning.Stein has raised nearly $7 million to fund the recount efforts, following news that security experts alerted Clinton's campaign to the possibility of hacks in key counties in those states.Stein is expected to speak at a \"Recount Rally\" taking place outside the Trump Tower at 10 a.m. Monday morning. At the news conference, she plans to offer an update on the recounts as part of her effort to \"fight tooth and nail to verify the accuracy, security, and fairness of the vote,\" according a Facebook event.CNN's David Wright contributed to this report.

Prior to doing the film, Younger had gone almost a decade without a directing gig and was preparing to give up making movies. Then he met Paz. \"He got me fighting again,\" he said. \"The man is a force of nature and that will, that desire is something we all need right now in this country.\" Miles Teller plays Paz in the film.   In the clip below, which you're seeing first on CNN, Paz prepares for his return to the ring, with his trainer (Aaron Eckhart) by his side. \"This is the moment that all of the work he put in, finally leads to,\" Younger said of the scene. \"All of that effort may amount to nothing. His trainer reminding him where they started, how far they've come; reminding him that he is a fighter above all else - in the ring and outside of it.\" The clip uses a montage to contextualize the moment, with flashback's to Vinny's long, tough journey back to health. Younger made the movie in just 24 days with a little over $6 million. It was a tall order, but he said he's thankful for Teller, who he was relieved jumped into the demanding role \"with both feet.\" \"He knew he was representing a champion, and a living one at that,\" Younger said. \"The comparisons, the [judgment], they would all be very real and very unforgiving.

{"_id":"Millions of dollars and 'nothing to lose': How Chinese start-ups are disrupting the electric supercar market ","articleText":"John McIlroy is Deputy Editor of Auto Express and Carbuyer. (CNN)It's not often that a start-up can claim to be a world-beater from the off. But that's precisely what's happening in the auto industry, where Chinese unknown NextEV has launched what it claims is the world's fastest electric car.Pure-electric cars have been around for decades but only in the past five years or so have the mainstream manufacturers really started to take them seriously -- prompted by tightening rules over when and where conventionally powered vehicles can be driven, and battery technology that has made them more usable in the real world.As such, there have already been a few upstarts, most notably Elon Musk's Tesla, which confounded the giant car brands by launching precisely the vehicle they said was impossible at the time: a luxury executive saloon with a range of more than 200 miles.Truth be told, Tesla's offering will still out-accelerate NextEV's NIO EP9 up to a point. But the NIO EP9's pace has been judged over more than just a quarter-mile drag race; this one-megawatt (1,341bhp) creation has, in fact, proven its mettle around the famed Nurburgring in Germany, a 12.9-mile monster of a race circuit known simply as 'The Green Hell.'Breaking recordsThe 195mph NIO EP9 has lapped the track, NextEV claims, in just 7m 05.12sec, or around 17 seconds faster than the previous electric car record. Indeed, to put it in context, the EP9's time is only beaten in the all-time list by four road-legal cars, two of them thinly disguised racers, and the other two supercars from Porsche and Lamborghini. And yet the EP9 can be recharged from flat in as little as 45 minutes, to offer a range of more than 265 miles. There is no guarantee that it will deliver this in production, but if it does, it has the potential to rewrite the rules of the hypercar market.NextEV has committed so far to six examples, all reserved for the company's initial investors. But, even with each EP9 costing around $1.2 million to build, the firm may consider an additional small production run, if only to raise its global profile further.China is a hotbed of EV activity because crippling pollution in many cities has persuaded Beijing to open up that side of the business to 'non-automotive' companies. Some, like NextEV and telecoms giant-turned EV developer LeEco, appear to have enough backing to not only deliver a car, but to reach global customers.China's growing electric vehicle marketThey are not alone in sharing that ambition. Earlier this year, the state-owned Beijing Auto International Corporation launched an EV sub-brand called ArcFox with a creation called the ArcFox-7. It has a 603bhp electric motor, is made mostly out of carbon fiber and can reach 60mph in less than three seconds -- though its top speed is more modest than the EP9's, at 155mph. Its range is more limited too, at 186 miles.Another brand, TechRules, has been testing an innovative hybrid supercar around the UK's F1 GP venue, Silverstone. The car carries the unusual moniker TREV, which actually stands for Turbine-Recharging Electric Vehicle, and it mixes plenty of cutting-edge tech -- including carbon fiber construction, a small lithium-ion battery pack and four-wheel drive -- to deliver a theoretical top speed of more than 217mph, while potentially running for more than 1,242 miles between fill-ups. Even the choice of fuel is open to interpretation; one version of the car, called AT96, can run on aviation fuel, diesel or petrol, while the other, called GT96, is powered by natural gas.Read: Inside China's largest ghost townQiantu Motor's K50, another 2016 debutant, sits just below supercar territory, but even so, its mix of aluminum and carbon fiber construction, and four-wheel drive through a pair of electric motors, brings performance that will match many European creations -- a top speed of 125mph and, more importantly, 0-60mph in less than five seconds.Luxury car manufactures enter marketStill, the Chinese are not likely to have the 'electric hypercar' space to themselves for very long. Desperate not to be beaten to the punch, the established car brands are now clamoring to get their own all-electric offerings to market. The giant VW Group is fast-tracking development of electric components and already showcased one of the first cars that will use them -- the Porsche Mission E. It's a four-door electric saloon, but its performance will rival that of many sports cars and it should introduce new standards for fast-charging, too.Read: Why China's super-wealthy are buying up traditional-looking homesEven the supercar elite who normally exist above the general industry are not immune to the demand for greater environmental credentials in their cars. The fastest vehicles recently offered by Ferrari and McLaren have both featured electrification, and the British company has already admitted it is working on an all-electric supercar. Interestingly, though, these are names with history, so they have a reputation to protect -- whereas NextEV and its like have hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and, at the same time, nothing to lose.Read: Is this where China's billionaires stash their investments? Winning over customers is about more than numbers, though. And this, in fact, may ultimately prove a bigger test for NextEV, TechRules and ArcFox than the technical challenge of getting around the Nurburgring (or, for that matter, actually bringing their cars to market at all). In the past, buyers with the wherewithal to spend more than a million dollars on a car have been more drawn towards those brands with heritage. The Chinese brands must hope that the same does not apply to those who want not just an exclusive supercar, but also one that they can plug into the wall every evening.","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/autos/nextev-nio-china-fastest-supercar/index.html"}

Koester would not elaborate on how it helped other than to say getting her face out to the public was \"the best thing anyone could do.\"Many questions stillOn Thanksgiving Day, Sherri's husband Keith -- who had made a teary public appeal for her return -- was at at his wife's side.But questions remain about what happened to the 34-year-old mother of two since her disappearance on November 2.Did she know her  abductors? Where was she held? Was the abduction planned? What was the motive? \"The investigation is far from over,\" Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said. \"In fact, it has only begun a new chapter.\"  Papini was found in Yolo County, California, about 140 miles from the Mountain Gate trail where she was last seen.Bosenko said Papini was spotted on the road by a driver about 4:30 a.m. Thursday.\"She is safe, in stable condition and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital,\" he said. \"She has been reunited with her husband.\"Bosenko said Papini \"was released by her captor on a rural road near I-5. ... She was bound with restraints but was able to summon help from a passing motorist.\" He said she was treated for unspecified injuries that were not life threatening. Sheriff: 'Sensitive information' not disclosedBosenko said there was \"sensitive information\" related to the disappearance that he would not disclose. Authorities are looking for two women in a dark SUV in connection with the case, the sheriff added. They reportedly are armed. Authorities at first focused their attention on Keith Papini, but he passed a lie-detector test and his employer confirmed he was at work when she went missing, according to the sheriff's office, CNN affiliate KCRA reported.\"It appears he's telling us the truth,\" Bosenko told the station. \"Generally, you can't trick a polygraph.\"Unusual caseRansom kidnappings or abductions of adults -- especially involving female perpetrators -- are unusual in the United States, according to CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos.  \"The facts as they are being relayed to us now, this is a very, very rare case,\" he told CNN on Friday.Investigators will \"have a lot of questions for this victim and, if she spent 21 days with her abductors, I think we can expect that she must have some more information about them that we just don't know yet,\" Cevallos said.Clues left behind?An iPhone, a pair of earbuds and a few strands of what were believed to be her hair were the only leads discovered in the days after Papini went missing. They were found on a jogging path not far from the Papinis' home. Neighbors told authorities Papini was last seen in the mid- to late-morning or early afternoon of November 2, Bosenko told HLN shortly after her disappearance. She was wearing a pink jogging top.Later that day, Keith Papini arrived home and it was unusually quiet, he told CNN affiliate KRCR-TV at the time. \"On normal days, I would open the door and my family comes, runs and gives me a hug,\" he told the station. Papini was not home. Nor were the couple's children -- ages 2 and 4. Her husband told the station that he called their day care center and learned the children hadn't been picked up. Papini used an app to track down his wife's smartphone, KRCR reported. It was down the street from their home. \"That's when I knew she had been taken or abducted, in my opinion,\" he told the station. Papini reported his wife missing.

{"_id":"Mississippi residents unsure of controversial billboard's intent","articleText":" (CNN)A provocative roadside billboard in Mississippi that mixes art and politics has united onlookers in anger and confusion. The sign on Highway 80 outside Pearl features President-elect Donald Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" superimposed on a well-known Civil Rights-era image by photographer Spider Martin. The famous \"Two Minute Warning\" photo shows a group of protesters including Hosea Williams and John Lewis confronting state troopers moments before violence broke out on the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama, in the 1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" conflict. The photo was taken moments before troopers unleashed tear gas on protesters and beat them with billy clubs before sending dozens to jail.Gov. Phil Bryant (R) has called the billboard imagery divisive and the mayor of Pearl wants it gone. Otherwise, people aren't sure what to make of it. \"I don't really know what to think,\" Pearl resident Madeline Nixon told CNN affiliate WLBT. \"It's definitely offensive, but it's their right at the same time. And that's what we as people need to understand: That everyone is entitled to their First Amendment.\"Is it racist? Maybe, Pearl resident Madison Hall told WLBT. Or, it could be there \"to show that cops are there to protect you, and they're there to help you.\" If people are talking about the billboard then it's working, said Eric Gottesman, co-founder of For Freedoms, an artist-run political action committee that uses visual media to inspire political engagement. The billboard is part of a national ad campaign that commissioned works from artists and photographers on topics from gun control to campaign finance for billboards, social media memes and public transit ads.There's no single goal or intent behind the Pearl billboard, he said. It's not irony or satire, anti-Trump or pro-Clinton. Using \"Make America Great Again\" was meant to prompt the question when was America great? he said. From there, he hopes it inspires conversation about the different ways the phrase can be interpreted beyond the campaign message.\"What we hear today in some political rhetoric is that making America great means enforcing a single vision on America,\" he said. \"What we're trying to do is use art to provoke people to talk about these things and bring them to a different kind of conversation, one that goes beyond symbolic gestures of what America is supposed to stand for.\"The photo -- as well as the billboard's placement -- is a reference to the South's history of civil rights protests, he said. The group wanted to place the imagery work in Selma but no billboard spaces were available, Gottesman said. Instead, the group looked to other locations in the South where race relations have been tested over the years through protest.The billboard is located near Pearl's airport, which is named for American civil rights leader Medgar Evers.\"We're hoping to take a place with an important history of protest and people struggling for freedoms and make people think about what that means today in the context of current political conversations,\" he said. \"Is this billboard a document of the past or is it the future we face as citizens?\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/mississippi-billboard-make-america-great-again/index.html"}

(CNN)Ghana's youth population is exploding and the upcoming elections provide a window of opportunity for them. Digital technology is enabling them to access, share and create information at a lower cost, greater speed and scale than ever before.  If citizens harness this power effectively, they can monitor and track election results and irregularities, make informed choices and mobilise young people to vote and vet their leaders.Fun campaigns using hashtags #iRegistered and \"Our Vote, Our Voice\" - #OVOV are encouraging young Ghanaians to register and vote. On average 66% of citizens in Ghana have voted in elections since independence and it's hoped that these technologies can help increase this figure. Citizens can also check their registration details by SMS using a shortcode established by Ghana's Electoral Commission.Activists suing MPsMeanwhile, Odekro, a parliamentary monitoring site in Ghana helps citizens scrutinize parliamentary proceedings and their elected representatives by enabling them to access information on their MPs and publish parliamentary debates word for word.  Nehemiah Attigah, Odekro's principal lead is excited by technology's potentially transformative role. \"Technology -- primarily social media platforms -- are enabling Ghanaians to fact check claims, consume news, participate in the electoral process and feel engaged in political party campaigns. Young Ghanaians are also encouraged to register and vote,\" says Attigah.MPs can no longer rest on their laurels. Last year, Odekro created a storm by sharing infographics on social media which highlighted MP's absenting beyond the limit that Ghana's Constitution allows. It revealed that almost 50% of MPs representing the two main parties are breaking the law. Evans Paul Aidoo was highlighted as the worst offender, missing an astounding 188 sittings.  Odekro is now suing 21 MPs for absenteeism, sending the message out loud and clear to parliamentarians, we the people are watching you.IAmAware Ghana, a web-based platform developed by think tank CDD-Ghana is taking things one step further by enabling people to visualize public data on services and demand better.  Citizens can find localised information on exam pass rates, textbook availability, infant mortality rates and disease incidence in their district and region. They've also created a district league table to rank performance across districts.Bloggers demand no 'politricks'Bloggers in Ghana are also gathering forces. BloggingGhana, a networking community for bloggers, has created a website - Ghana Decides which collates news on elections. Citizens can access live interviews with MPs, participate in polls, find out about disqualified candidates and view infographics to quickly visualize manifesto highlights, issues relevant to youth and voter registration procedures.  These nuggets of information are being rapidly distributed across social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, sparking informed debate among citizens.Jemila Abdulai, their social media lead explains why this is so critical. \"Traditional media in Ghana has a reputation for being politicized, particularly during elections. That's why social media initiatives like Ghana Decides are important.\"They offer a good balance for Ghanaians at home and abroad: non-partisan, factual, and issue based information, with none of the 'politricks'.\"Tracking oil spend, via an appPenplusbytes, a civic tech organization, has developed several platforms  and an app that supports free and fair elections.  They are fact-checking political campaigns and collating data from social media and SMS reports to track election irregularities, fraud and outbreaks of violence.  They plan to share this information in real time with the Electoral Commission and the National Elections Security Task Force, enabling more rapid response when it's needed most.Read: #FeesMustFall: What are the student protests about?They're also creating short videos which can be easily shared on social media and WhatsApp to encourage youths to vote.

They're combating this through data journalism and generating content which promotes issues based discussion. Their web platform and Android app, Know Your Budget enables citizens to scrutinize the budget, allowing them to see petroleum receipts and allocations by region and sector.With all this information at our fingertips, we could easily be lulled into a false sense of security, viewing technology as a panacea to all social problems.  If only things were so simple.Just 30% of Ghana's population are online, with only 13% subscribing to Facebook. Fewer still truly believe their concerns are being acknowledged and addressed.  There are also huge gaps in the data available for citizens to scrutinise their leaders.  Even when this information is available, few are adequately skilled to use it well.Read: American election: Why do young Africans care?We can start tackling the digital divide through intermediaries like journalists and civic groups, which can help bring some of this critical information offline through national and regional public dialogues. The wide reach of radio stations must be harnessed. Cultural change is also needed, to make government accountability the norm.Nonetheless, this digital age is an exciting one, giving hope to citizens across the continent that their voices can and will be heard, empowering nations to shape their own future and keep their leaders in check.Loren Treisman is executive of Indigo Trust, a grant-making foundation that supports mobile and web-driven projects in Africa, with a focus on government accountability and citizen empowerment.

{"_id":"More than 1 billion people globally are living with high blood pressure","articleText":" (CNN)In 2015, there were 1.13 billion people living with high blood pressure worldwide, with the majority of them in low and middle-income countries.The findings come from a new study published Tuesday in The Lancet, which found that the number of people affected by high blood pressure has almost doubled over the past 40 years. In most countries, men were found to have higher blood pressure than women.The study highlighted a stark contrast between where people are most affected, with high-income countries showing a sharp decline in blood pressure among their populations in recent decades, while low- and middle-income countries have seen numbers spike -- particularly in South Asia and Africa.\"When you look at this globally, blood pressure is a condition of poverty, not affluence,\" said Majit Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College London, who led the analysis. \"The relationship with national income is completely inverse.\"The difference was made more evident by that fact that half of the world's adults with high blood pressure in 2015 were living in Asia.The United States, Canada and South Korea had the lowest rates in the world, while the UK had the lowest proportion of people with raised blood pressure in Europe.\"In the high-income world ... (rates) are coming down despite the aging and increasing population,\" Ezzati said. \"But in the population (in Asia), as the age goes up, the blood pressure tends to be higher.\" He adds that this is most likely down to differences between these populations in terms of healthy food options but also access to health services providing diagnosis and treatment.The global highs and lowsAn estimated 226 million people in China were found to have high blood pressure, along with 200 million in India. The top five countries for high blood pressure among men were all in Central and Eastern Europe: Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovenia. For women, the top five were all in Africa: Niger, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Somalia. To reveal these findings, Ezzati collaborated with the World Health Organization as well as hundreds of scientists around the world to study changes in blood pressure in every country between 1975 and 2015. \"We wanted to know what was happening,\" said Ezzati, who believes that blood pressure is a more extensive problem than obesity and diabetes and warns of the range of health conditions that stem from someone's blood pressure being raised, such as stroke, heart disease and kidney disease. Blood pressure is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths globally, almost 13% of all deaths, according to the WHO.\"As the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, reducing blood pressure is also a key step to meeting the overarching target of reducing non-communicable disease mortality,\" said Gretchen Stevens, a statistician with the WHO's Department of Information, Evidence and Research who worked with Ezzati's team. \"This new study is a first effort at compiling data to assess whether country trends are progressing in the right direction to meet the World Health Assembly target,\" Stevens said, referring to a goal set in 2011 aimed at reducing the prevalence of high blood pressure by 25% by 2025.Who is at most risk?Raised blood pressure is defined as someone having systolic blood pressure above 140 and a diastolic blood pressure above 90 -- usually read as 140/90. Systolic pressure is the force with which the heart pumps blood through the blood vessels, while diastolic pressure measures resistance in the body's blood vessels to the blood flow.A number of factors are known to increase someone's risk of raised blood pressure, including high levels of salt and potassium in their diet, environmental factors such as lead exposure and pollution, and lack of diagnosis and treatment options. Genes also have a role to play.A lesser-known risk factor is the role of poor nutrition early in life, meaning children who are undernourished are more likely to have elevated blood pressure when they are older.\"All of these things matter,\" Ezzati said. Some of these risk factors are more common in the low-income countries, perhaps explaining why they are now showing higher burdens of blood pressure, where services to educate and treat people are also lacking. \"They are inevitably part of the story,\" he said.A lack of options in place to deal with the problem means that number will only continue to rise in coming years, added Ezzati. \"There is no sign of rates becoming flat,\" he said. \"We should expect worse for a while.\"The need for better servicesThe team believes that the situation has become as extensive as it is today due to the failure of the global health community to prioritize the problem.Many diseases once thought to be linked to affluence are now proving to dominate the poorer regions of the world, including obesity, diabetes and cancer, but Ezzati believes blood pressure is hitting them the hardest.\"At the global level, we should be thinking of blood pressure as a condition of poverty,\" Ezzati said. He believes strategies need to be set in place to tackle the problem, such as improving access to fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year and channeling aid money to address better nutrition. \"The perception is that people are not getting enough calories, but the reality is, they're not getting healthy calories,\" said Ezzati. \"Making fresh, healthy food affordable and accessible for everybody should be a priority.\"Targeting obesity and diabetes among poorer nations will involve setting the same priorities.But Ezzati also wants health systems to be better prepared to diagnose and treat raised blood pressure in the poorer regions of the world. \"It's not just prevention,\" he said.\"These statistics are shocking,\" said Julie Ward, blood pressure manager at the British Heart Foundation, adding that 16 million people are living with high blood pressure in the UK alone. \"These findings remind us that people living in deprived areas are at a much greater risk of having high blood pressure. And we remain greatly concerned that almost half of all people with high blood pressure in the UK are unaware of their condition and remain undiagnosed.\"\"High blood pressure remains a leading risk factor in many regions globally,\" Dr. Rajiv Chowdhury, a senior epidemiologist in the Department of Public Health at the University of Cambridge, wrote in an email. Chowdhury was not involved in the study but agrees that environments need to be better tuned to enable people in Asia and Africa to live healthier lifestyles. \"(The burden) is driven by suboptimal behavioral factors common in many African and Asian countries, such as excessive salt consumption, growing obesity and lack of adherence to antihypertensive medication.\"Robert Clarke, professor of public health at the University of Oxford, added the need for better services targeting the burden. \"The results highlight the need to raise awareness of hypertension, introduce safe and effective treatment for hypertension and monitor affected patients to ensure appropriate control of those who are being treated,\" he said. \"Hypertension remains a serious public health problem in the United States, but the favorable trends observed in the United States and other Western countries underscores the importance of 'check, change and control' programs that have been advocated.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/health/high-blood-pressure-global-statistics/index.html"}

Activists also created a petition on the change.org website calling for punitive measures against the morning show.\"Do not cover domestic violence with makeup, condemn the aggressor,\" said the petition, posted by a group calling themselves Concerned Moroccan Citizens.\"As Moroccan women and as feminist activists in Morocco, and in the name of all Moroccan people, we denounce the message of normalization with violence against women. We demand severe sanctions against this show, 'Sabahiyat,' and the channel 2M,\" they added.They encouraged signatories to contact the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication, demanding it take action against 2M and \"Sabahiyat.\"The channel apologized two days later, saying the segment was inappropriate, an editorial error of judgment and in violation of its policy of 27 years that advocated for women's rights. It also removed the video clip from its website. The apology did little to placate the outrage. Social media users continue to condemn the channel and the petition had attracted more than 2,000 signatures by Monday.\"The media attacks the core of all plans to combat violence against women,\" Moroccan politician Saadiya Elbahi wrote on Facebook. \"It normalizes violence against women, legitimizes it and covers it with makeup.\" Domestic violence is not a crime in Morocco and, according to a government survey conducted in 2009/10 by Human Rights Watch, two thirds of women had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic violence.A draft bill criminalizing domestic violence was passed by the first chamber of parliament, the House of Representatives, in Morocco in July.However, due to a general election last month, it has yet to be reviewed by the second chamber, the House of Councillors.According to Rothna Begum, Middle East and North Africa women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, the draft bill does not do enough to ensure victims will get the help they need from authorities.\"It is a step forward. It does provide for some protective measures but only where a victim has started a prosecution, and women often tend to drop prosecutions because of pressure from their families,\" she said.CNN contacted 2M TV and the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication.

{"_id":"Most U.S. beers to get calorie and ingredient labels","articleText":" (CNN)The most popular alcoholic beverage in America is about to get all health-conscious: Most beer brewers are voluntarily including freshness dating, calories, nutritional details and an ingredients list on their labels. The goal for brewers and importers is to fasten new labels on all their cans and bottles by the end of 2020, said the Beer Institute. However, the new labels should begin appearing immediately. Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, HeinekenUSA, Constellation Brands Beer Division, North American Breweries and the Craft Brew Alliance --- institute members, one and all --- have agreed to make the change. Combined, these companies produce more than 81% of the total volume of beer sold in the United States, the institute said in a statement. \"Some craft beers have as many calories as a hamburger or an ice cream cone,\" said Betsy Thurston, an Atlanta-area registered dietician who specializes in eating and weight concerns. \"Why shouldn't we be entitled to know what we are consuming?\" According to Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, the initiative provides consumers with \"meaningful information\" that will \"empower\" their decision-making. In some cases, brewers may also provide a reference to a website or a QR code with added nutritional information. Some of the participating companies say they've already taken steps toward greater transparency.\"We are fully supportive of this initiative and already provide significant information about our beers at www.tapintoyourbeer.com,\" Anheuser-Busch said. Thurston agrees \"information is power\" and added that \"we are in the midst of an unprecedented health crisis with diabetes and obesity-related health problems in the last several years.\" More than a third (78.6 million) of United States adults are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while 29.1 million people (about 9%) of the population have diabetes. A quarter of those with diabetes have not been diagnosed. The combination of alcohol and diabetes can be particularly unhealthy. When you drink, the alcohol moves quickly into your bloodstream without being metabolized in the stomach. The average person requires about two hours to metabolize one drink; this work is done by the liver. Because your liver has to work to remove the alcohol from your blood instead of doing its main job of regulating your blood sugar, drinking alcohol can cause low blood-sugar levels for some diabetics. Symptoms include sleepiness, dizziness and disorientation -- dangerous, possibly lethal side effects for drinkers and, if they drive, for others as well.The new labels are not likely to inspire those who love their liquid courage to abstain. Still, forced to confront a calorie count, some drinkers will probably think twice before having another. \"I see only positives for the consumers,\" Thurston said.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/health/beer-labels/index.html"}

The strike was part of an ongoing Iraqi-led operation to free the city from more than two years of brutal rule by ISIS militants. Only the city's oldest bridge remains. The bridges were \"disabled in order to reduce Da'esh freedom of movement and limit their ability to resupply and reinforce fighters,\" said Col. John L. Dorrian, spokesman for the US mission in the Mosul operation, using another name for ISIS.The coalition coordinates all strikes with the Iraqi government ahead of time, Dorrian explained.\"The implications of disabling or damaging civilian infrastructure are carefully considered before action is taken,\" he said, adding that the bridges will be easily repaired after ISIS has been driven out.Iraqi-led forces had surrounded the entire city by Wednesday, an alliance of paramilitary groups said, in the tightest chokehold forces have had on ISIS fighters since the operation began.Taking out the bridges enables Iraqi-led forces to contain ISIS fighters further, but it also means the movement of civilians is restricted.\"We're concerned that the hundreds of thousands of people who are stuck, hoping for a chance to flee during a lull in the battle, will be trapped. Bridges are crucial for getting out of the city center,\" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told CNN. \"We want people to be able to leave safely.\"Dorrian said the greatest threat to civilians leaving Mosul is ISIS, \"who have shown no reluctance whatsoever about endangering or killing civilians in their efforts to slow the Iraqi advance.\"Mosul's civilians were told by Iraqi officials they should stay in their homes as forces prepared to enter the city -- a crown jewel in ISIS' envisaged caliphate -- where a bloody battle was widely expected.Many were also too afraid to flee, with ISIS snipers and improvised explosive devices positioned around the city border.But now, as clashes have continued in the city since forces entered on November 3, many are afraid to stay, desperately looking for a way out.69,000 people displacedOn Wednesday, paramilitary groups backing Iraqi forces said they had finally cut the main route between Mosul and the ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria.ISIS had been able to send resources from Raqqa -- including fighters, suicide squads and explosives -- to Mosul through this route. It was also used as an escape route for senior ISIS members and their families, who fled Mosul for Syria, civilians have told CNN.Currently, around 69,000 people are displaced by the Mosul operation, the IOM reports, and aid agencies say the humanitarian situation is getting desperate. In refugee camps on the city's outskirts, agencies are scrambling to distribute food, water and clothing. \"We have temporary kitchens in our camps, and in one night alone we might get 10,000 hot meals out,\" said Joe Cropp from The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\"This is one of the worst humanitarian crises of the year. We are now just starting to see the situation in a city that has been closed off for the past two years and the needs are starting to become apparent,\" he said. \"Families have been unable to access clean drinking water, or enough food, children haven't been going to school -- the education system was essentially closed down.\"More than 100,000 forces have taken part in the Iraqi-led coalition in the operation to take Mosul, including ethnic and religious minority groups, such as Shia, Kurdish and Christian groups.Iraqi officials have said that only government forces actually entered Mosul by ground.CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Ingrid Formanek reported from Irbil.

He was released and returned to the hospital a few days later, in early September 2016, with a fever, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the report. Blood tests of the boy showed organisms that are normally found in feces caused an infection which an extensive medical evaluation could not to explain.

The bus had just left Woodmore Elementary School with 37 students and had not dropped off any students, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A.

She waited nearby where she could see children being removed from the bus and transported to hospitals.\"I stayed there about an hour because I didn't see my son being removed at all,\" she said.\"When they told me that the front-of-the-bus kids hadn't been removed it automatically gave me that mother's instinct that my baby was up there because I had been sitting up there while they was pulling out the kids one by one and I hadn't seen my son yet.\"After learning that several children were taken to the emergency room she went to the hospital.She waited and waited and waited. \"At first they took us into an injury waiting room and said they didn't know where he was.\"After five hours, she finally learned around 10:30 p.m. that her son was dead.Brown said she has yet to see her son. Authorities told her they would call her and let her know when can see him in the examination room. Meanwhile, Brown will attend a Tuesday memorial service for families affected. \"It took so long for me to find out my baby was gone.

{"_id":"Muslim restaurant to feed the homeless and elderly for free on Christmas Day","articleText":"London (CNN)A  Muslim-owned Turkish restaurant is offering a free three-course meal to the homeless and elderly on December 25, because  no one should eat alone on Christmas Day. The gesture stemmed from a chance encounter with a woman who needed help closing her window. The restaurant, Shish, is located on the outskirts of London. Early last month, an elderly woman who lived in the neighborhood came in to the restaurant and asked if anyone could help pull down a window she was having difficulty reaching. The staff didn't hesitate. And when the woman returned the next day to thank them, she told them how she'd be alone for Christmas. Her situation reminded owner Serdar Kigili of his mother in Turkey, whom he hadn't seen in five years. The management team then came up with the plan.The team first advertised on the restaurant's front window with a hand-written note:  \"No one eats alone on a Christmas Day! We are here to sit with you. 3 course meal for the homeless from 12-6pm. Any homeless or elderly are welcomed.\" The post has now been shared more than 1,000 times on the restaurant's Facebook page.It inspired more than 25 residents to volunteer their time helping out that day. And a group of taxi drivers in the area have also said they will shuttle the elderly and homeless to and from the restaurant for free. \"It's not about religion, language or culture. It's about community,\" one of the managers, Irfan Can Genc, told CNN. The approximately 66-seat space will be open all day, serving starters of soup and cacik, a yoghurt-based dip and mains of chicken, vegetarian casserole or chicken shish. Traditional rice pudding will be offered as dessert.Genc says that he hopes the store will set an example for the community and that other restaurants might grab hold of the holiday spirit of giving.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/europe/muslim-restaurant-christmas-homeless-elderly-trnd/index.html"}
{"_id":"N.C. governor wants recount, though signs point to Cooper win","articleText":" (CNN)The votes are in. They've been in. But North Carolina still doesn't know who its next governor will be. On one side, you have Attorney General Roy Cooper, the Democrat, who has repeatedly declared himself the winner. He is calling himself governor-elect in press releases and has already set up a website to collect resumes for leadership positions in his administration. On the other is incumbent GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who is demanding a recount of the votes. Previously, he had contested the election via challenges in dozens of counties, and he asked the state Board of Elections to take jurisdiction over the challenges. The board convened Tuesday to hear both sides. \"There's nothing to suspect that Pat McCrory's supporters have been systematically disenfranchised,\" said North Carolina State University political science professor Steven Greene.According to the state's unofficial count on November 8, Cooper won by more than 6,000 votes. The Cooper camp said Tuesday that the latest count puts him ahead by more than 8,500 votes. If the board of elections determined there were that many bogus votes, all for Cooper, it would suggest widespread fraud, which McCrory hasn't proved, Greene said. Governor: Fraud, fraud, fraudThe governor's news releases of late would seem to suggest otherwise. In announcing McCrory's demand for a recount, his campaign manager, Russell Peck, raised the specter of voting irregularities across the state. \"With many outstanding votes yet to be counted for the first time, legal challenges, ballot protests and voter fraud allegations, we must keep open the ability to allow the established recount process to ensure every legal vote is counted properly,\" Peck said. In other news releases, the governor's team has cited \"an absentee ballot fraud scheme\" and \"hundreds of fraudulent Cooper ballots.\" Some voters were dead while others had voted in multiple states, the governor's campaign claimed. The board of elections discovered that more than 339 felons had voted early or cast absentee ballots, said one release. It added that the state board was looking into \"hundreds of potentially fraudulent absentee ballots\" in Bladen County. Could McCrory prevail in recount? There are always irregularities among the millions of votes cast in North Carolina (or in any state), Greene said. And yes, North Carolina does allow for recounts in contests decided by 10,000 or fewer votes. But the irregularities, absent widespread fraud, don't tend to reach anything near 10,000 votes, he said. Ten thousand is just a safe number to ensure accountability, he said. \"It allows for faith and confidence in our democracy. This was close so we're going to make extra sure,\" he said. There is no expectation that any recount will significantly close, let alone reverse, a gap of between 6,000 and 8,500 votes, the professor said.\"That's a much larger amount of error than we've seen,\" he said, explaining recounts tend to shift totals by a few hundred votes at most, not thousands, and the errors tend to be balanced -- both for and against candidates. 'No path to victory'Cooper's team has pointed out that in eight counties, GOP-controlled local election boards appointed by the McCrory administration have rejected challenges to the vote tally. Cooper's campaign manager Trey Nix brushed off the governor's demand for a recount, claiming that as counties finish counting the votes, Cooper's lead is growing. \"This is nothing but a last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and deny the results of this election,\" Nix said in a news release. \"We are confident that a recount will do nothing to change the fact that Roy Cooper has won this election.\"Earlier in the day, Nix stated, \"There is no path to victory for Governor McCrory.\"Could legislature decide?There has been speculation that McCrory has an ulterior motive to his challenges: to lay the groundwork for the state legislature to determine the race's outcome. State law allows for it, though it's been used only once, according to The News & Observer in Raleigh: in the 2005 race to fill the state superintendent of public instruction seat.If the General Assembly decided the race, the law says that state courts could not review the decision. But Rick Hasen, a law and political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, pointed out on his Election Law Blog that nothing in the North Carolina law could or would prevent the federal courts from stepping in. If Cooper secured more votes and there was no indication of fraud, \"it could well be both a Due Process and Equal Protection Clause violation for the North Carolina legislature on a partisan basis to consider a 'contest' and overturn the results and hand them to Pat McCrory,\" Hasen wrote. N.C. State's Greene believes the speculation is little more than fear-mongering anyway, noting that Republican lawmakers have been relatively reticent about the prospect of deciding the election. If it were a real possibility, they'd be laying the groundwork, Greene suspects.The prospect is \"fairly implausible, politically speaking,\" he said. \"(Republican lawmakers) have a veto-proof supermajority, so the idea that they would dramatically threaten their credibility to reinstall Pat McCrory over the will of the voters seems like a stretch,\" he said. \"They've had complete control for the last four years.\"So, what's at play? Why would McCrory continue challenging an election that he clearly appears to have lost?\"Desperation? Don't overthink it,\" Greene said. \"It really doesn't make a lot of sense.\"CNN's Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report. ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/north-carolina-governor-race-recount-pat-mccrory-roy-cooper/index.html"}
{"_id":"NATO's big problem isn't Trump, it's Brexit","articleText":"John McTernan is a former speechwriter for ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex-communications director to former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)NATO has a big problem. And it's not President-elect Donald Trump. In the end, the alliance knows how to talk to him and it knows how to influence the security apparatus that sits round any president. No, the real challenge for NATO can be summed up in one word: Brexit. It's not that Brexit in any way weakens the commitment of British politicians to NATO. Far from it. They have been vehemently -- and sincerely -- committing to continued defense cooperation. The problem is what the Brexit vote proved to the rest of the world: Longstanding international organizations that do not renew their popular mandate are vulnerable.But there is one big difference between the European Union and NATO. While Brexit is in reality little more than a self-inflicted wound that only makes Britain poorer, a weakened NATO threatens everyone.Russian President Vladimir Putin understands this. There's been a lot of talk recently about his moving of missiles into Kaliningrad. When he does so, he is doing two things. On one hand, he is probing defenses, just as he does when Russian submarines enter Swedish waters or Russian jets enter British airspace. On the other, and more significantly, he is opening another front in his information war.  The missiles are being moved, Putin says, in response to NATO \"expansion.\" This is a fictitious grievance -- there is no such thing as NATO expansion, just sovereign states freely deciding to join it. Putin knows this. His claim is aimed firmly at European citizens. His aim is to sew doubt and dissension to undermine the shared sense of mission that underpins NATO.The danger of Russia's NATO rhetoric The danger is not that citizens in European countries agitate for their nations to leave NATO, but that that they come to accept the steady Russian delegitimization of NATO, that they come to believe that Russia is the victim. It has happened before. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union used the \"peace movement\" in an attempt to undermine the West's resolve. It took the courage of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl in West Germany to ignore public demonstrations against the stationing of Pershing and cruise missiles at US bases in their countries. Now, NATO and the leadership of member countries need to show similar resolve. That starts with fully understanding how fragile support for NATO is. Just imagine that a Russian minority in a Baltic state agitated, claiming oppression, such as Russian minorities in other countries formerly occupied by the Soviet Union have done in the past. Then further imagine that Russian troops are used in a police action to \"protect oppressed Russian minorities.\" In which NATO countries would there be a majority of the public who supported the deployment of troops in support of the invaded country? Britain? Germany? Unlikely. The bet that Putin is making is based on this assumption that there is no popular support for Article 5 -- the mutual self-defense clause of the NATO treaty. Is he wrong? The good news is that the case for NATO hasn't been lost -- it just hasn't been made. In a one sense, this is understandable. The Cold War is now taught in high school history.But in another, it is unforgivable. Security is the first duty of government. Where that demands cooperation, governments must do so; where it requires consent, that must be built.  Winning the information war with Russia starts at home -- NATO's European leaders need to start now.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/opinions/nato-big-problem-opinion-john-mcternan/index.html"}
{"_id":"Nancy Pelosi re-elected as House Democratic leader","articleText":"Washington (CNN)House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi defeated Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan ‎to retain her post as the top elected Democrat in the House during a closed-door meeting Wednesday.The final vote was 134 to 63 for Pelosi, meaning she matched her prediction that she'd retain the support of two-thirds of House Democrats. But it also means that close to one-third of the diminished group voted for a change in leadership after getting beat again on Election Day.Pelosi brushed aside those concerns Wednesday, telling CNN, \"They weren't defections, I got two-thirds of the vote.\"The veteran leader, who has led the group since 2003 through three Republican House speakers and her own tenure at the top, said she viewed Wednesday's battle as a chance to start winning again. \"My heart is broken that we didn't win the White House this time,\" she said. \"We know how to win elections, we've done in in the past and will do it again.\"Even though he fell far short of toppling Pelosi, Ryan still claimed some victories Wednesday -- including a dispersal of power inside the House Democratic Caucus and plans to focus on the economic, bread-and-butter issues that many Democrats say Donald Trump swiped from them in the election. \"I am proud that my bid for Democratic Leader pushed our members to have these tough family discussions about our future and how we win back the majority in 2018,\" Ryan said in the statement. \"I am also pleased to see that Leader Pelosi will adopt my proposal to expand leadership by creating a position for Freshman members and to bring back the power to the Committees by creating Vice-Chair/Vice- Ranking Member positions.\"House Democrats ended up winning six more seats than they had before, whittling the Republican lead in the House down to 239-194, but they fell far short of expectations -- some of which, at a few high points during the fall, had them possibly recapturing the chamber.At least one Republican saw the results as a positive for the GOP.\"What a relief. I was worried they had learned from the elections & might be competitive and cohesive again,\" Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted immediately after news of the results broke.Ryan, who has considered running for higher office in the past, including the US Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown, would not rule out a run for governor of Ohio when asked Wednesday. Governor races across the country remain one of the few potential bright spots for the Democrats coming off of November's defeats.\"I think I could make a big difference pulling those Trump voters back because those are the voters who voted for me,\" Ryan told reporters Tuesday evening.Pelosi, showing confidence, declined to address the caucus before the vote, letting surrogates talk on her behalf. After the vote, she addressed the caucus again but sources said she did not mention Ryan's name. At a press conference, she later congratulated him.House Democrats voted by secret ballot. Although there has been some grumbling in recent years about the refusal of top House Democratic leaders, who are mostly in their 70's, to provide chances for newer members, this race featured a rare public airing of that fight in the days leading up to the vote.Both Ryan and Pelosi called, emailed and met with their colleagues to make their pitches on why they should lead a demoralized caucus, which is still searching for a strategy for dealing with President-elect Trump and a strengthened Republican-led Congress next year. Ryan, 43, said Pelosi, a California Democrat who is 76, has limited appeal in the heartland and other working-class areas where Democrats lost badly this fall. For the most part, Pelosi had refused to engage in a back in forth with Ryan, but on Tuesday she fired back at the Ohio Democrat, who was a frequent surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his home state, telling the Huffington Post in an interview, \"he didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\" The minority leader insisted she had \"strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area.\" She brushed off his criticism that she can't appeal to voters in rural areas and on conservative media outlets, saying, \"You know what? If you want to come interview me, I'm happy to answer your questions about how we go forward. I'm not going to pay attention to, 'I can't step in a union hall.' I'm a woman of steel in there. ... I'm constantly invited by the unions to go to their meetings. That's just not, it's just not true.\"Ryan had about a dozen public supporters within the caucus going into the meeting, which will include over 190 members in the next Congress, but still claimed before the vote that he is \"within striking distance.\"Many of Pelosi's allies say she has deep support and her record-breaking fundraising skills are a quality members need to be competitive in 2018. She has already proposed some reforms to caucus rules to respond to the push from newer members that there are few opportunities to advance.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/politics/house-democrat-election-results-nancy-pelosi-tim-ryan/index.html"}
{"_id":"Natalie Portman humanizes former first lady in flawed 'Jackie'","articleText":" (CNN)Movie biographies always wrestle with the balance between finding the essence of the subject and replicating his or her look and manner. Natalie Portman devotes so much energy to the latter as to partially sacrifice the former in \"Jackie,\" an intriguing look at Jacqueline Kennedy in the wake of her husband's assassination that plays more like a series of monologues than a wholly realized movie.In some respects, the film arrives at a propitious time, looking back at that \"one brief shining moment\" when a presidential administration could be likened to Camelot. Those fascinated by the Kennedys and the abundant tragedy that has surrounded them will find another handsomely produced window into the family's story.Nevertheless, the movie is a shiny but flawed and narrow prism through which to view this oft-examined dynasty.Despite its theatrical release, \"Jackie\" by all rights should have been a cable-TV movie. Indeed, in many respects it's a sort-of companion to HBO's recent stage adaptation \"All the Way,\" which picked up in virtually the same window, with Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as president.\"Jackie\" similarly tracks the aftermath of JFK's death in a concentrated format, using the device of Jackie's interview with a Life magazine reporter (Billy Crudup) to flash back not only to that fateful day, but glimpses of the couple's life together.Working from a script by Noah Oppenheim, Chilean director Pablo Larraín meticulously replicates scenes from the TV special \"A Tour of the White House,\" which helped foster an image of the model-pretty Jackie as the ultimate Stepford wife. Those scenes stand in stark contrast to the steely figure she presents post-assassination, one preoccupied by the optics of her husband's funeral to the chagrin of President Johnson (John Carroll Lynch) and his advisors.Portman won an Oscar six years ago for \"Black Swan,\" and given the ferocious, emotionally wrenching nature of the performance, she'll likely find herself in that conversation again. She certainly throws her all into a part filled with anger, pain and defiance.That said, her commitment to impersonating the breathy tenor of Jackie's voice exacts a price, at least initially coming across as stilted and distracting. A separate problem resides in the movie's structure, which frankly seems better suited to the stage than screen.Beyond her one-on-one conversation with the writer, Jackie discusses morality with a minister (John Hurt) and debates Jack's legacy with brother-in-law Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard, waging his own fitful battle with the famed Kennedy accent). Too often, these sequences play more like speeches than organic, flesh-and-blood encounters.Thanks to its constricted time frame, \"Jackie\" is also notable for what it omits. There's no mention of Jackie's life beyond this immediate period of grief and mourning -- which included marrying Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis, and becoming fiercely protective of her children and guarded in terms of the public eye. JFK's infidelities, meanwhile, are only obliquely addressed.Technically, the movie is impressive. Larrain has not only replicated that horrible day in Dallas but almost seamlessly incorporated snippets of actual footage surrounding JFK's funeral and other key events, creating a strong sense of authenticity. But much of that is a triumph of wardrobe and hairstyling -- adding more to \"Jackie's\" handsome exterior than its moving but fitfully realized core.\"Jackie\" opens in the U.S. on December 2. It's rated R.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/entertainment/jackie-review/index.html"}

It's nice because it kind of tells a story, too, about her background,\" Portman said. \"She has this very New York accent, [in] which you see this sort of Long Island heritage. Then you also get this kind of breathiness in the voice that shows this very desire to present yourself, especially when she was on TV it gets kind of breathier, to present yourself in a kind of feminine, coy way.\"In the film, Jackie is interviewed a week after Kennedy's death by a reporter [played by Billy Crudup] for \"Life\" magazine. In the course of their conversation, she shaped the memory of her husband by quoting from the 1960 Broadway musical, \"Camelot\" -- forever linking Kennedy's unfinished term in office to \"the brief shining moment\" of Camelot.\"She really just was so smart,\" Portman said. \"[She] really understood history and really understood that the people who write history are the ones who define it. The story you write is more important than what actually happened, if you come up with a good enough tale.\" \"Jackie\" releases nationwide in theaters December 2.

{"_id":"National Cathedral to remove Confederate symbols in windows","articleText":"Washington  (CNN)Leaders at the Washington National Cathedral have voted unanimously to remove Confederate battle flags from stained-glass windows memorializing Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson.The symbols will be replaced with panes of plain glass, the National Cathedral said in a statement issued Wednesday. The development comes as the church plans forums on racism, slavery and racial reconciliation. The long-term future of the Lee and Jackson windows will be discussed.The Confederate battle flag was featured prominently in pictures posted by Dylann Roof. Roof has been charged with killing nine people at a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, on June 17, 2015.  He confessed in interviews with Charleston police and the FBI, two law enforcement officials told CNN. He also told investigators he wanted to start a race war, one of those officials said.The incident sparked a national debate about whether state and private institutions in the South and beyond should feature the Confederate flag, which many see as a symbol of racial oppression. The National Cathedral is owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, but is often used for national prayer services and the funerals of top Washington officials, including former President Gerald Ford.In the statement, cathedral leaders said no date is set for the removal of the Confederate symbols. The Rev. Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas, the cathedral's canon theologian, said the change will provide \"an opportunity for us to begin to write a new narrative on race and racial justice at the Cathedral and perhaps for our nation.\"The windows will remain in place for the duration of future public discussions, the cathedral said. The first session is set for July 17.The windows were installed in 1953 at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and are two of many stained-glass bays on the cathedral's main level.The two windows were put in place to honor \"the lives and legacies of Confederate Generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee,\" according to the Very Rev. Gary Hall, former dean of the National Cathedral.Hall last year said the National Cathedral had installed these windows to \"foster reconciliation\" between the North and the South. But they did more than simply seek to repair a divided nation, he said.They sought to \"reframe the Civil War and present these two generals as saintly, exemplary Christians\" when these two men were in fact ardent supporters of Hall called an \"unjust cause ... the sin of slavery.\"\"We can live with some contradictions until we can't,\" Hall said.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/06/09/living/national-cathedral-confederate/index.html"}

From land to sea, the island is long on allure.Getting the lay of the landOn foot: Naxos Hiking tours traverse marble walkways, fertile plains, vineyards and olive groves and wind along paths connecting village to village. \"My grandparents were walking these beautiful paths, it was a way of life,\" says leader Stella Korre, who likes to intertwine the rich history and mythology of Naxos with routes that touch all five senses. On horseback: Naxos Horse Riding expeditions lead riders through the Naxian farmlands, onto long stretches of beach and to hidden spots where the views are a textured blend of mountain and sea.  Families working in the fields, inland villages and ancient sites give riders a sense of the island's past and present.On wheels: Mount Zas, the highest peak in the Cyclades region, rises in the core of the island with an elevation of 1,003 meters. According to Greek mythology, the king of the Greek gods, Zeus, was raised in a cave on Mount Zas, the highest peak in the Cyclades.   It's also the background for some of the most scenic bike routes in the Cyclades. While excursions with Naxos Bikes don't climb the mountain, it's never far away as riders glide past villages and archaeological sites. Catching the windBy kite: The Cyclades are known for their summer winds called meltemi, guaranteeing ideal conditions for kitesurfing and windsurfing. Kitesurfers head to Mikri Vigla beach, an expansive stretch of sand where kites are launched with ease.Flisvos Kitecentre Naxos operates there year round. Owner Michele Gasbarro says the beach is one of the windiest places in Europe thanks to the Venturi effect between Naxos and Paros.On a board: Laguna beach is off-limits to kitesurfers due to its proximity to the airport, but it offers great conditions for windsurfers. Protected by a reef, the calm water is ideal for beginners who don't want to venture too far away from the coast. More advanced riders can head farther out to sea.Gear and instruction is available through Laguna Beach Park windsurfing center.On a boat: Sailing around Naxos incorporates the island's ancient sites and mysterious sea caves.\"Dolphins come out to play. We sail past towers, temples and water sea caves filled with stalactites,\" says captain George Fragiskos of Naxos Sailing, who has been sailing around Naxos for more than 40 years.With wings: Bird watchers understand just how diverse the Naxian landscape is. Naxos' wetlands belong to the list of the 380 protected biotopes of the Natura 2000 network.   Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) and the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) live on the island year round, according to Ioannis Gavalas, a local bird watcher and author of \"Flying Over the Aegean.\" Seasonal birds like Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) can be seen between June and October.Taking the watersFrom the deep: Panagiotis Niflis is convinced Naxos is one of the best diving destinations in Greece. A diver and instructor running Blue Fin Divers, Niflis takes groups down to a diverse array of sites including the spectacular Marianna wreck, a 91-meter-long cargo ship that sank in the 1980s between Paros and Naxos.    \"The dive is unique because of the shallow depth, condition of the vessel and great visibility of about 30 meters. The wreck is covered with colorful sponges,\" says Niflis. Caves and reefs also draw divers of varying levels. From the shore: While blessed with mountains, valleys and lagoons, the beach is never far off on Naxos.  With its impressive stretch of white sand beach, Agios Prokopis is a favorite, a Blue Flag-accredited stunner with spectacular waters. There's also great swimming at nearby islands of the small Cyclades like Iraklia, Schinoussa, Koufonissia and Donoussa.Digging into the cultureLinks to the gods:  At the tip of Naxos' harbor on the Palatia islet, a massive and majestic marble doorframe called the Portara has stood since 530 B.C., the 80-ton entrance to an unfinished temple of Apollo.  According to Greek mythology, Dionysus, the god of wine, found his future wife, the Cretan princess Ariadne, on the islet. She had been deserted by Theseus, the king of Athens. The islet hosted the first ancient Dionysian festivities.The Portara is an arresting sight, especially at sunset and easily accessible via a stone promenade.Evidence of the Venetians: Further in Naxos Town, also known as Chora, the Venetians left their architectural influence when they established Naxos as the Duchy of the Aegean, the headquarters for a long line of dukes following Marco Sanudo's rule of the region in 1207.  Today, Naxos' well-maintained medieval castle, which once protected Naxians from pirate invasions, stands in the historic Kastro (castle) district.One well-preserved tower belonging to Nikos Karavias' family is now a museum and the atmospheric venue for the Domus Festival, a cultural event Karavias organizes every summer.Taste of the land: According to Greek mythology, god of wine Dionysus found his wife Ariadne on Naxos. He loved the island so much, he gave it the gift of fertility.Today, Naxos is a lush and bountiful exception in the typically rocky and barren Cycladic islands. Farm-to-table tours prove Naxos is an island that can feed itself.  Naxos Sun Holidays arranges authentic Naxian cooking classes taught by locals. Island specialties such as a delicious chard savory pie made from wild greens, herbs and rice called sefoukloti make the most of local ingredients.  Another popular dish is kokoras me makaronia, a baked rooster dish with pasta and a rich tomato sauce.Marissa Tejada is an author, travel writer and freelance journalist based in Athens, Greece.

{"_id":"New amputation procedure offers promise","articleText":" (CNN)The world has watched in wonder as technologists unveil bionic arms and robotic legs. But just as these prosthetic advances offer hope to those who've lost limbs, the surgical side of amputations has largely stayed the same, a pioneering doctor said Monday. Not anymore. A first-of-its-kind amputation procedure, conducted in July, was shared during a news conference at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Boston. \"Dynamic-model amputation\" may allow the brain to interact with and power a prosthetic -- and sense where a limb is without the patient having to look. With a preserved relationship between muscles in concert with prosthetic innovations, Dr. Matthew Carty explained, patients may enjoy restored limb function in new and more natural ways. The idea of what could be possible was a welcome one for Jim Ewing, 52, who underwent the experimental procedure. An engineer by training, he liked the idea of being part of something visionary.What life looked likeAbout two years ago, Ewing, of Maine, fell 50 feet while rock climbing in the Cayman Islands. He landed on his left side and received multiple injuries, including a shattered ankle. No matter the excruciating work he did in physical therapy, severe nerve damage blocked meaningful progress. He could not walk barefoot. Stepping on a simple grain of sand would fire off sharp and stabbing pain. In shoes, he couldn't travel 100 feet without stopping in exhaustion and agony. He plowed through medical journals and researched clinical trials, but nothing suggested that his ankle could be saved. He couldn't bear to live with this sort of pain. A longtime climber, he reached out to Hugh Herr, a man he'd met 30 years before. Herr, himself a climber whose legs were amputated below the knees after he was rescued from a 1982 winter climb, had become head of biomechatronics research at the MIT Media Lab. Biomechatronics is a field that combines human physiology with electromechanics in developing bionic limbs. Ewing told Herr he wanted to know what life would look like if he decided to amputate his foot.Ewing said Herr told him of those who'd struggled for years, only to have their limbs amputated in the end. He also told him how surgeons had generally viewed amputation as a failure. \"Finally,\" Ewing said, \"he told me about the research he and Dr. Carty were doing. ... I was intrigued.\"Soon after meeting with Carty, director of the lower extremity transplant program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, he was sold.\"It's now been four months since I had my foot removed. It's been challenging. I won't lie,\" Ewing said. Nonetheless, he's \"100% certain I made the right decision.\" 'The Ewing Amputation'A standard amputation cuts feedback between muscles, Carty said. But by creating a tendon pulley system through \"the Ewing Amputation\" -- as this new procedure will be called -- muscles can work in relation to one another, and patients can maintain a better connection to the nervous system and to the feeling of limb control. Carty has been collaborating with other plastic, vascular and orthopedic surgeons as well as Herr's team at the MIT Media Lab. His work was bolstered in 2014, when he was awarded the first Stepping Strong Innovator Award, established by the The Gillian Reny Stepping Strong Center for Trauma Innovation to fund projects in innovative trauma treatment and recovery. (Reny was 18 when her legs were critically injured -- and later saved -- during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.)  On the MIT Media Lab team is Tyler Clites, a Harvard-MIT doctoral candidate in health sciences and technology. He shared a video to demonstrate how sensors on Ewing's left leg track the electrical activity in his muscles, showing results unseen in previous methods of amputation. Within the next few months, Clites said, Ewing should have wireless sensors implanted in his muscles, which will integrate with the robotic prosthetic being created for him.Ewing will be able to point and flex his prosthetic foot and rock his ankle from side to side -- a range of motion made possible by the new surgical approach.Without knowing the intricate details, Mike McLoughlin is intrigued by what Carty and the MIT Media Lab are doing. He's the chief engineer for the research and exploratory development department at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. In this role, he serves as the principal investigator for the Revolutionizing Prosthetics Program. McLoughlin said his team has made similar strides with upper extremity prosthetics, using electrodes and computers to detect muscle movement and help the brain communicate with the prosthetic. People can imagine opening and closing their hands, for example, and see it happen.What's new here, McLoughlin believes, is the focus on lower extremities. What a hand does is complex, he said, and when we use our hands, we're generally aware of what we're using them for. With feet, we walk and run without thinking about them in the same way.With issues like balance and the need to hold significant weight, he said, what Carty and the MIT Media Lab are attempting involves a different set of challenges. \"It's a really exciting thing they're doing here,\" McLoughlin said. \"I'm anxious to see where they're going with it.\" A better quality of life Carty's procedure to restore the natural dynamic of limbs should work for both lower and upper extremities, the surgeon said.  And though the team hasn't implemented a way to revise the procedure for those who've already experienced an amputation, he said, \"We have an idea of how that would work.\" Rather than see amputation as a failure, the result of \"throwing in the towel,\" he and others hope this procedure will help people view amputation as a choice, a possibility that may restore a better quality of life.That's certainly been the case for Ewing, who -- even though he hasn't gotten his final robotic prosthesis -- is already grateful.With his temporary prosthesis, he went on a 2-mile walk recently and has returned to climbing indoors. \"I'm even relearning how to run, though they don't want me running yet,\" he said. \"It's so liberating to be moving so quickly and easily.\"To be a part of this milestone experiment motivated him, he said. It gave him \"a chance to give back to society\" in a meaningful way.\"I literally fell into this situation,\" Ewing said. \"I consider it a great honor to have this new protocol bear my name.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/health/amputation-innovation/index.html"}

{"_id":"New hope in superbug fight: Tasmanian devil milk","articleText":" (CNN)Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck's occasional enemy, the voracious Tasmanian devil, may pose a threat to something we'd actually like to see disappear from this planet: the superbug.Researchers in Australia have suspected that Tasmanian devils and other marsupials carry particularly powerful chemicals in their bodies to help their young grow. Marsupials are those mammals that are born incredibly early in their development and grow into the furry creatures you'd recognize only after spending a couple months suckling inside their mothers' pouches; think kangaroos and opossums. Australia is home to hundreds of native marsupial species, including the Tasmanian devil, a brown or blackish furry creature that looks a bit like a baby bear, with stocky legs and sharp teeth. Much like the \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon, Tasmanian devils may best be known for their prodigious appetites. Sometimes called the \"vacuum cleaner of the forest,\" the world's largest carnivorous marsupial eats birds, snakes, fish and bugs. And it consumes everything: bones, fur, organs and meat. Superbugs are bacteria that no longer respond to antibiotic treatment. Because the drugs have been overused, many bacteria have adapted, making the drugs less effective. At least 23,000 Americans die each year due to these infections.What led scientists to investigate the Tasmanian devil's potential to kill superbugs was not its appetite, but its pouch. Born about three weeks into a mother's pregnancy, tiny Tasmanian devils, known as imps, must crawl up through their mother's fur to this pouch, where they will suckle and continue to grow for about four months.The new home is far from sterile. Studies have shown that a Tasmanian devil's pouch contains a significant amount of bacteria, including pathogens that could hurt the underdeveloped young. Scientists assumed there must be immune system-boosting qualities in the mother's milk to help the vulnerable young develop in that environment. Testing the milk, scientists found several peptides called cathelicidins, a natural kind of antibiotic. Humans carry a cathelicidin in their system, but we have only one, LL-37. Tasmanian devils have 12.The study was published in the latest edition of the journal Scientific Reports.When exposed to the peptides from Tasmanian devil milk, multidrug-resistant bacteria like vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA) died.The research is in its early stages, but knowing about the superbug-fighting properties of Tasmanian devil milk could lead to new drugs. Superbugs are considered a major international health threat, so significant interest in the research is expected. Experts believe drug-resistant bacteria could kill 10 million people by 2050, or one person every three seconds, if there aren't any major breakthrough drugs to fight them.The news may also help the Tasmanian devil population, which is currently an endangered species, with an estimated 10,000 to 25,000 left in the wild. The creatures, which are now found only on the Australian island state of Tasmania, used to be abundant on the Australian mainland. A concerted effort in the 1800s eradicated them from the mainland, because ranchers mistakenly thought they were killing livestock. A rare contagious cancer, not ranchers, is now the Tasmanian devils' biggest enemy. Devil facial tumor disease has killed thousands of Tasmanian devils since the 1990s.  Don't expect to see Tasmanian devil milk on your pharmaceutical shelf any time soon. A lot more research will be needed to see what more the peptides can do.Scientists are also looking at other members of the marsupial family to see whether animals like the milk from koalas and wallabies may also fight superbugs. Earlier research in wallabies has showed similar results.\"And the really hard part is scaling up the production to produce mass quantities for clinical trials,\" said John VandeBerg, a pioneering geneticist and professor who works with another marsupial, the South American gray short-tailed opossum, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. \"I do think it is feasible, though, and this could be a whole new dimension for our arsenal to combat these superbugs. This could lead to very important work.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/health/tasmanian-devil-milk-superbugs/index.html"}
{"_id":"New life, apart: Rare surgery to separate brothers conjoined at head","articleText":"New York (CNN)Anias and Jadon McDonald are twins conjoined at the head. Their birth was rare; science says the boys are one in millions. Their parents couldn't agree more.\"They're so perfect,\" says their mother, Nicole. \"They're beautiful, and they are so funny and so happy.\"At 13 months, Jadon is the rambunctious one. He runs in place and tries to roll off the bed to get away from his brother. When his brother plays with a toy, Jadon rocks back and forth until he can snatch it away.  Anias is the contemplative one who loves listening to his mom read. He's struggled more in infancy than his brother. He is the silent warrior, his mother says, with a gaze so captivating, it's as if \"he looks at your soul.\"\"I could almost keep them like this,\" Nicole says. Their father, Christian, agrees. He says they've grown to know both boys' personalities, and \"we like them the way they are.\"And yet Nicole and Christian have made the decision no parent should ever have to make: do what they believe is in the best interest of their twin boys, even if it means risking their lives.\"This is so hard,\" Nicole says, \"I'm not going to sugarcoat it.\"She says she's even started \"going through a grieving process, because I've only known them\" joined together. She runs her fingers through a swirl of hair the boys share at their foreheads and says how much she'll miss doing that.  The couple is sustained by faith. They pray often and seek counsel from their minister. They say they've put their trust in God, no matter the outcome. \"I don't know what the answer is to my prayers yet,\" Nicole says, breaking down crying. Christian says he recently began to wonder whether they're doing the right thing. Family and friends reassured him that they're making the proper decision. \"I can't wait to see them as two separate little boys,\" he says. \"That's what excites me the most. I really just want to know my boys.\"Early Thursday, Jadon and Anias were wheeled down the pediatric corridor at Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. They were moved from their hospital room on the 10th floor to the operating room about 7:15 a.m. Their 3-year-old brother, Aza, rode on the gurney with them, leading up to the OR. Mom and Dad kissed them goodbye before steeling themselves for up to 20 hours of waiting, all with the hope two healthy boys will return -- together, but forever separated.At the invitation of the McDonald family and Montefiore hospital, CNN has been given exclusive access to the remarkable and rare journey of Jadon and Anias. From the heart-wrenching decisions to move forward with surgery to the neurosurgical marvel of the operation itself to the months of recovery and rehabilitation, CNN will offer a glimpse into a world few have ever seen. The surgeon leading the operation is Dr. James Goodrich. Considered by many to be the world's leading neurosurgeon for twins conjoined at the head, he now hopes to become the man who comes between Jadon and Anias and successfully separates them.\"This is about as complicated as it gets,\" Goodrich says while holding 3-D printed models of the boys' conjoined brains. Twins joined at the head, called craniopagus twins, are exceedingly rare, occurring in one out of every 2.5 million births. About 40% of the twins are stillborn, and another third die within 24 hours of their birth. Studies have showed that 80% of twins joined at the head die of medical complications by the age of 2 if not separated. Simply making it to this point has been quite a feat for the McDonald boys, who share 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter of brain tissue. Although meaningful statistics are hard to gather with something so rare, it is safe to say the separation procedure carries major risks, including the possibility of death or long-term brain damage for one or both boys. Goodrich prefers not to dwell on those risks and instead describes a sort of rebirth he hopes to achieve for Jadon and Anias. \"The boys will forever have a second birthday,\" Goodrich says, to mark the day they were separated.  \"They go back to a 1-month-old,\" Goodrich says. \"They have to learn to sit. They have to learn to roll. They have to learn to walk. They basically go through a yearlong period of a second infancy.\"Nicole and Christian know well the milestones the twins have missed in their first year, like crawling and walking. They marked those with their oldest son, Aza.Sitting on a park bench outside the hospital, Christian lays out his hopes and dreams. He longs to roughhouse with the boys and chase them. Nicole simply wants to pick them up when they cry and rock them to sleep. The boys don't have cribs. They share a queen-size mattress with a pillow between them. There's no stroller big enough to allow for walks around the block. The same goes for car seats: When the twins are transported, Mom and Dad must place them on the floor of their minivan and drive very carefully.It's those simple everyday moments of parenting they miss. Even the thought of pulling a T-shirt over the boys' heads can send Nicole into a fit of tears. That's something she's never been able to do. The boys wear only onesies.The parents say they are telling their story to honor the medical staff for taking care of them over the last several months -- and they hope their message can help other parents struggling with a sick child. \"To let them know these things that are difficult,\" Christian says, \"can be a blessing in disguise.\"Nicole, 31, worked as a pediatric physical therapist and has been helping the boys with their motor skills, preparing them for being separated. Her favorite thing now is sitting quietly in the living room, listening to them babble back and forth in their bedroom, as if they're talking to each other. For Nicole and Christian, life nowadays is a collision of fear and joy, of excitement and anxiety. There are so many unknowns about prognosis and survival the McDonalds have had to find comfort in uncertainty. Christian says they understand that \"one or both twins can be neurologically challenged, or they can have a mental or physical handicap\" as a result of the operation. \"We know that is definitely a real possibility, but we're still going to love our boys,\" the 37-year-old father says.  They worry most about Anias. He has suffered with breathing and feeding difficulties and has had vision and heart issues. He is fed by a machine hooked up to his stomach. He had seizures at one point, but they've since been kept in check.  Standing in the boys' bedroom, the parents agree that despite their worries, surgery is in the boys' best interests. There have been other craniopagus twins, similar to the McDonalds, who have grown old joined together, learned to walk and even get married. It is by all accounts a challenging life. Not the life Nicole and Christian want for their boys.\"We're so excited,\" says Nicole.\"These boys, they're raring to go,\" Christian says. \"They can't stay like this any longer.\"Glancing over at the twins, the mother tells them, \"In just a couple weeks, when you cry, I'll get to hold you.\"The boys squeal. The most experienced neurosurgeon of his kind in the worldDr. James Goodrich enters the conference room at Montefiore Medical Center carrying an assortment of those 3-D replicas of the twins' brains. \"I've got more brains than I know what to to do with,\" he quips and then takes his seat. Most recently, he separated a set of Syrian twins in Saudi Arabia this year. Goodrich is the most experienced craniopagus neurosurgeon ever. This will mark his seventh separation surgery. He's consulted on 13 other conjoined twins -- all joined at the head -- around the world. Pushing 70 years old now, Goodrich still has the boundless energy required of a man who will operate nonstop through the day -- and the night. His bright gray beard makes him look more like a globetrotting archeologist, which is half right, than a pediatric neurosurgeon. The lifelong surfer returned from Chile last week, chasing the big waves.The McDonald boys have undergone three operations over the last year to begin the separation process. They've had four tissue expanders placed in their heads to expand their skin so it can be stretched and sewn back together. \"So far, everything's gone beautifully,\" Goodrich says. He will be joined in the operating room by Dr. Oren Tepper, a 39-year-old plastic surgeon who will reconstruct the boys' skulls and stitch their heads closed. He's never worked on conjoined twins before but has participated in hundreds of cranial-facial surgeries during his career. \"This is a once-in-a-career case,\" Tepper says. \"I have all the skills, all the training to be able to do this.\"About a week beforehand, Goodrich and Tepper sit in the conference room for a virtual walkthrough of the surgery. The 3-D models on the table are just a small part of the technological advancements made over the past decade. Three-dimensional computer images appear on a large screen. The visuals are piped in by a state-of-the-art company called 3-D Systems. Goodrich talks back and forth with biomedical engineers from Colorado on  speakerphone, instructing them on what he would like to see onscreen.An image of the boys' conjoined skulls appears. Then the skulls disappear to reveal their brain images in three dimensions. \"Let's put the top brain back and take the bottom brain out,\" Goodrich says. Within moments, the venous structure of one child's brain flashes onto the screen. Goodrich points to a cluster of intricately tangled veins the boys share; these are his biggest concern for the operation.\"I know the vascular system we have to go through is complex,\" Goodrich says. \"It's big. It's doable, but it's going to be tedious.\"Brain mapping like this, Goodrich explains, is nothing short of phenomenal. \"This is all unique to this surgery,\" he says. He's already spent countless hours studying the anatomy of the boys' brains. The imaging eliminates the guesswork and surprises that have popped up in prior surgeries. \"When you're doing a reconstruction like this, even when you're working on cranial-facial reconstruction, there's a lot of guessing,\" Goodrich says. With the new technology, he says, \"you're no longer guessing.\"The four tissue expanders placed in the boys' heads were first mapped to specific locations with the 3-D imagery. That was crucial in allowing the surgeons to know they'd have enough skin for reconstruction and to place the expanders away from incisions from the first three surgeries to lessen the chance of infection. \"None of that was ever possible before,\" Tepper says. \"That's the first time that's ever been used.\"Only 58 craniopagus separation surgeries have been reported worldwide since 1952. Goodrich was thrust into fame in 2004 when he operated on Carl and Clarence Aguirre, twins from the Philippines who shared about 8 centimeters of brain tissue. The surgery was initially celebrated as the first craniopagus surgery in which neither child had long-term neurological damage. Carl, however, suffered neurological decline over the year and a half after the surgery, resulting in permanent disabilities, including a seizure disorder. He speaks only a few words and is confined to a wheelchair. Both boys still wear protective helmets.Arlene Aguirre recently celebrated her boys' 14th birthday. Goodrich was there, as he's been for every birthday the past 12 years. \"He never forgets,\" she says. She feels the pain of the McDonalds and has spoken with Nicole, giving her advice and support. \"I don't have any regrets that I did the surgery. Dr Goodrich did the best he could.\"The surgeon adds, \"the fact we were able to get one out with good functionality and the other out alive and doing well, but clearly with cognitive and motor skill delays,\" is still something to celebrate. The historical norm was that both children died during surgery or that one survived but with neurological devastation. Over the years, Goodrich has learned to choose twins carefully; sometimes, their brain anatomy is so intertwined, the risks of surgery are too great. On Thursday, Goodrich will skip breakfast and enjoy a cup of coffee, preferably a cappuccino, before beginning the surgery. His mantra is to \"take it easy and slowly and carefully.\"What's it like to separate twins?\"It's actually pretty awesome,\" he says. \"It's chaotic. You're trying to get two kids on two tables. ... The problem is when you have nothing holding the brain in, the brain can actually slip and fall out. So, it's quite a treat to get them repositioned. \"We've got it down to a fine art, but in the beginning, it was a bit of a challenge.\"Like Nicole and Christian, Goodrich's biggest concern is for Anias, because of the issues he's already faced. Traditionally, the weakest child is most at risk of dying on the operating table.'God gave you these babies. They're meant for you'Prior to all this, Christian and Nicole McDonald lived an uneventful life in Braidwood, Illinois, a town of 5,000 about 70 miles south of Chicago. He was a truck driver; she was a pediatric physical therapist. They were busy raising their firstborn, Aza, when Nicole got pregnant and they went for a routine ultrasound in May 2015. It took just 30 seconds for the technician to blurt out, \"Oh, you have two babies in there.\" Excitement immediately filled Nicole: She thought about the need for a bigger house, a van. They didn't have two car seats; they'd need to buy another.Nicole returned home, intently focused on the October due date, when the phone rang. \"You need to come back immediately,\" the voice at the other end of the line said. Nicole responded that her husband was at work, and she wasn't sure whether she could get back. \"No, you need to come now,\" the voice barked. Her grandmother offered to watch Aza, and her mom, Chris Grasso, escorted her to the doctor's office. Again, Nicole was told no relatives could join her in the examination room.The second ultrasound took about two seconds. The radiologist stepped into the room to deliver the news. \"You know, Mrs. McDonald, I don't know what to tell you, but your twins are conjoined,\" the woman said. \"What do you mean conjoined?'\" Nicole asked.\"From what it appears, they share a head. We don't know how much.\"Her memory of that day gets fuzzy after that. Nicole was told she was being referred to the maternal fetal specialty unit at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"We'll get you an appointment. I'm sorry,\" the radiologist said.In a daze, Nicole stumbled into the waiting room and burst into tears. She told her mother to get the car. Inside the vehicle's confines, Nicole continued to sob. \"What's wrong? What's wrong?\" her mother asked.\"These babies are conjoined,\" Nicole said.\"What does that mean?\" her mother asked.\"They're conjoined at the head. I don't know what we're going to do.\" Her mom responded with a quiet stoicism: \"God gave you these babies. They're meant for you.\"Her mother's words were a game-changer for Nicole. The tears soon stopped flowing. She immediately went into research mode -- determined to give birth to the babies, no matter what. But first, she had to tell her husband. She hesitated to call him. She worried that he would be driving his truck and might crash. When she dialed his number, he picked up immediately. He was sitting in a parking lot. Christian cried at the news. He was afraid his wife could die during birth, and he worried for the health of their twins. \"Don't worry. We'll figure it out,\" Nicole told him. \"I've already been on the computer.\" She kept a journal, including every doctor and medical department that could be of help. When she called Boston Children's hospital, recommended as one of the best programs in the country, they called her back within five minutes. They also recommended the gray-bearded surfer, Dr. James Goodrich.Nicole says that at every doctor's appointment up to 20 weeks, they were asked whether they wanted to abort the pregnancy. \"Terminate\" is the term the doctors always used. Friends and family suggested it, too; an abortion would be more merciful, they said. \"I even had to think about it,\" Christian says, \"because I didn't want to make some rash decision.\" Ultimately, they knew they would take this journey together, as a family. \"I heard their heartbeats,\" Nicole says. The boys were born nearly a month early, on September 9, 2015, via an unscheduled C-section. Arrival time: 11:11 p.m. \"They were normal little boys, like any other two little babies you would see -- except for being conjoined,\" Christian says. They planned to name them Caiden (for \"warrior\") and Tavish (for \"twin\"). But Dad flipped through the book \"100,000 Baby Names\" at the last minute and stumbled across the name Anias, also of Hebrew origin. He marveled at its definition: \"God answers.\"It was the perfect match for another name they'd liked for its meaning: Jadon, \"God has heard.\"As he looked at his boys in the neonatal intensive care unit, Christian felt that God had spoken. The boys had their names.A new life for the family, in preparation of new lives for the twinsMuch has happened over the past year. Mom and Dad quit their jobs and moved from their tiny Illinois town to the heart of the Bronx to be close to the hospital. Continuing to work a full-time job was not possible: The twins consume their entire day, even with nurses helping out 16 hours a day.The parents must also tend to their 3-year-old, to make sure he's not lost amid the commotion. Aza has grown quiet; he's been known to slip outside, climb the fence and sneak onto a neighbor's trampoline. Even a simple family outing can be stressful. The twins must be placed on the floor of their minivan, and that requires Mom and Dad to lift them in unison and walk together. The McDonalds live solely on the generosity of others. The family receives packages in the mail with clothes for the boys. Strangers send checks, too.  One donor who has been a generous contributor to the hospital is helping cover living expenses. The cost of the surgery is about $2.5 million. The parents have health insurance covering much of the expense, but not all. The family also has set up a GoFundMe page to help offset the cost.An 83-year-old neighbor has taken particular interest in the family. Martin O'Malley is an Irish immigrant who has lived on the block for 45 years. He helped the McDonalds get meals delivered to the home when they first arrived. Neighbors and strangers drop off money at O'Malley's house to take to the family. A local mechanic told him he wouldn't charge for fixing his car: \"You give the money to that family.\"\"I love them -- all of them. The little twins get to me,\" he says, fighting back tears. \"I'm a twin myself. My other half, she died at birth.\" He looks up to the sky and holds his hands up: \"Please God, may it all work out.\"Preparing for the big dayOn a loveseat in the family living room, the McDonalds say their joy overwhelms their doubts surrounding the surgery. \"We just feel good about the outcome,\" Christian says. \"I'm prepared mentally and emotionally,\" Nicole says. \"It's just the preparation for that day that is hard.\"Like seeing the boys scream every time the tissue expanders are filled with more fluid and being helpless to console them. At one recent appointment, Jadon flashed an angry look at Dr. Tepper, as if he were saying, \"Stop right now!\"\"I had never seen a 1-year-old give a look like that,\" Nicole says. The first 72 hours after the operation will be the most crucial and life-threatening. If the boys do well through this time, they will probably spend the next several weeks in the pediatric critical care unit. The next stop: an inpatient recovery rehabilitation center, possibly for several months, where they will continue to heal and learn to roll over, lift their heads and achieve other infant milestones. They will be outfitted with protective helmets. The surgeon is not worried about the boys' speech being affected because of the area of the brain where he's operating. It's their motor skills that will need the most rehabilitation. \"They have no back control because they've never sat up,\" Goodrich says. \"They've never crawled.\"Nicole longs to hold each twin in her arms. She's not sure when that moment will arrive, but she's pictured it many times. \"There's nothing harder than watching your child cry and not being able to pick them up,\" she says. \"To hear them cry and react to it in a motherly way is something I'm really excited for.\"The entire surgical team shares her feeling. Tepper, the plastic surgeon, became a father right around the time he met the twins. \"There's a different perspective when you become a parent,\" he says, adding that he can better empathize with the McDonalds and \"how much stress and anxiety they must be feeling through this process.\" \"It's going to be exciting to separate them,\" he adds, but the ultimate satisfaction will come when doctors can hand \"these individual boys to their parents separately.\"It will be a simple and powerful moment -- the kind the McDonalds say they've learned to appreciate. Going to the park. Taking a stroll with your kids. Hugging them. That's their advice to others -- to cherish life's small moments -- even as they approach their biggest.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/health/mcdonald-conjoined-twins-to-separate/index.html"}

{"_id":"Nicaraguan President wins fourth term, this time with wife as VP","articleText":" (CNN)Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has clinched a fourth term in office with a landslide victory -- this time with his wife as his running mate.With more than 98% of the ballots from Sunday's election counted, Ortega had garnered 72.5% of the vote, state media said Monday.First lady Rosario Murillo has long been the country's unofficial co-president, effectively running the government, analysts of Nicaraguan politics say. In August, when the couple made their ticket official, Ortega said she was the best running mate he could choose: \"Who better (to be vice president) than my companera, who has so far done an efficient and effective job with much discipline and sacrifice.\" The move by Ortega, a socialist and former guerrilla leader, is not without controversy, as critics have accused the couple of skirting laws while building a political dynasty. Nicaragua's Constitution bars candidates who are relatives of the current President from running, however the Supreme Court of Nicaragua has said there was no legal impediment for the Ortega-Murillo ticket. \"It makes no sense,\" said Eliseo Nunez, a former opposition lawmaker, maintaining that the ticket clearly violates the Constitution. \"It's like saying: My brother-in-law can't run because he is related to my wife, but my wife can run.\"Adding Murillo to the ticket is a way for Ortega, who will be 71 in a week, to ensure a political succession plan, said Michael Allison, a political scientist with the University of Scranton. \"Daniel and Rosario have been consolidating power for over 10 years,\" he said. Despite cries of foul by opposition, Ortega has strong support in the country, Allison added. Who is Daniel Ortega? Ortega came to power as part of the Sandinista rebels who overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979. He fought against the US-backed contras during the 1980s and has remained a key ally to Venezuela.He was first elected as president in 1985, and ran unsuccessfully in 1990, 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006 and 2011. Before Ortega's term, presidents in Nicaragua were not allowed to serve consecutive terms, but that didn't stop him in 2011. In 2014, he used his power to pressure lawmakers to do away with term limits, allowing him to run in Sunday's election.  Who is Rosario Murillo?Since her husband took office in 2007, Murillo has been by his side, offering a warm shoulder and smile to the country, reshaping Ortega's brand by softening his image, and steering his political agenda. She is a writer, poet and avid activist. Murillo has long been the face of Ortega's administration, said Christine Wade, a political scientist and co-author of \"Nicaragua: Living in the Shadow of the Eagle.\" \"Some people consider her to be the power behind the man,\" Wade said. \"She's played a very significant role in some of the popular social programs in Nicaragua. She's the face of the administration, she runs Cabinet meetings and she has very popular radio programs.\"Murillo, 65, runs many of the country's most widely embraced social programs -- which remain popular among the country's poor. \"He wasn't particularly popular and neither was she,\" Wade said. \"She has really become a force to be reckoned with in Nicaraguan politics, for better or for worse, and I think that now she has been given a title that actually reflects the work that she has been doing all along.\"More election controversy Ortega's victory is a win that even his harshest critics expected. Many called the elections a farce and vowed not to show up at the polls.Some opposition lawmakers have been kicked out of the electoral process and international monitors had initially been told to stay home during these elections, prompting an international outcry.In September, a bill in the US Congress dubbed the NICA Act was introduced that would block American loans to Nicaragua unless it took \"effective steps to hold free, fair, and transparent elections, and for other purposes.\"Ortega allowed the Organization of American States and other unnamed international groups to have a limited role in overseeing Sunday's election, the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington said.But that didn't convince critics, including the US State Department, which said on Monday that the Nicaraguan government had \"degraded the legitimacy of the election.\"\"In advance of the elections,\" the State Department said, \"the Nicaraguan government sidelined opposition candidates for president, limited domestic observation at the polls and access to voting credentials, and took other actions to deny democratic space in the process.\"CNN en Español's Samantha Lugo and CNN's Catherine E.

She told CNN that her desire to have a family stemmed from her own \"maternal instincts,\" which have been a \"driving force\" in her life since she was a young girl.\"I think because I've experienced motherhood in so many different ways,\" she said. \"I've experienced adoption, birthing a child and I've experienced surrogacy. I'm like when it comes to it, I just wanna be a mama.\"\"I suppose my maternal instincts and drive has always been there since I was little ... and that's a huge driving force of who I am, which is why I probably played it out in so many different ways. I am a mother because I love being a mother.\"Related Link: For 'Lion,' Dev Patel took his mind and body to new placesKidman plays Sue Brierley in the true story of an Australian woman who adopts a 5-year-old boy from India after he is separated from his family. The boy, Saroo, grows up, decides to search for his biological family and uses Google Earth to find them.\"As Sue said, there are so many facets to adoption,\" Kidman said. \"There's women that adopt because that's what they've come to. There's women that adopt because that's the vision that they had, which was Sue. There's women that adopt because suddenly something happens in the family. Like in my family, my mother's cousin became her sister because her mother adopted her because her family passed away. So there are so many different ways in which adoption plays out, and I'm just glad to show one side of it.\"For Kidman, the film, also starring Dev Patel and Rooney Mara, holds a very special place in her heart. \"I've made films that make philosophical statements or examinations of the human condition and all, but this for me is a film very much about life and about connection and the strengths of mothers,\" she said. \"Lion\" hits theaters Friday.

{"_id":"Nigel Farage for US ambassador? Trump tweet has UK squirming","articleText":"London (CNN)The UK has rejected a suggestion by US President-elect Donald Trump that it should appoint the figurehead of the Brexit movement, Nigel Farage, as ambassador to the US.Trump caused diplomatic ripples when he said on Twitter that Farage, interim leader of the anti-immigrant UK Independence Party (UKIP), would \"do a great job\" in the post.A spokesman for the office of British Prime Minister Theresa May blocked the idea, telling CNN the UK appoints its own ambassadors and that the position was filled. Trump's expression of a preference for UK ambassador to Washington was a startling break with diplomatic protocol. It is unheard of in recent years for any US official to make such a suggestion to an ally.It was particularly awkward for the UK as Farage has long been a thorn in the side of May's Conservative party. UKIP's political surge forced her predecessor, David Cameron, into holding a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. That ended in the shock vote to leave the EU and Cameron's political downfall.Britain put its best diplomatic face on Trump's unexpected intervention. \"There is no vacancy. We already have an excellent ambassador to the US,\" the Downing Street spokesman said.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson echoed the comments in parliament Tuesday.\"We have a first-rate ambassador in Washington doing a very good job of relating both with the present administration and with the administration to be, and there is no vacancy for that position.\"Kim Darroch took up the role of US ambassador in January, with three decades of diplomatic experience under his belt. His career has focused on national security and European Union policy issues.Farage: 'The world has changed'Farage responded to Trump's public endorsement Tuesday, saying on Twitter that he was \"in a good position\" to help the bilateral relationship.In an article for Breitbart News, formerly run by Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon, Farage said he was surprised by Trump's tweet. It was a \"bolt from the blue,\" he wrote, and called for the British government to take note. \"The world has changed and it's time that Downing Street did too,\" he said.Farage told CNN's Richard Quest after Trump's election that he doubted he would be offered the role of ambassador, given his relationship with the governing party in the UK.\"The British Conservative Party are incredibly snobby about me. They've always looked down upon me. They find it very difficult to even have a conversation with me,\" he said. \"If they came to me and said, 'Would you want to do something that would help the benefit of our country, and our trade relationship with America, and that would work both ways,' if they came and asked me to do it, of course I'd think very hard about doing it. But I honestly think it's unlikely.\"Bonding over BrexitTrump and Farage have often expressed admiration for each other. Trump often compared his campaign for the presidency to Farage's efforts in the UK. In August, Trump tweeted: \"They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!\" and on Election Day he told supporters that his policies would be \"Brexit plus plus plus.\"Farage was quick to board a plane after Trump's victory, congratulating him three days later during a meeting at Trump Tower in New York.On Twitter, Farage posted a photo of the pair, with Trump giving his signature thumbs-up gesture, and Farage wide-mouthed with excitement. \"I'm confident he will be a good President. His support for the US-UK relationship is very strong. This is a man with whom we can do business,\" Farage posted.UKIP facing investigationBack in the UK, Nigel Farage's UKIP is facing scrutiny over whether it breached funding rules. The UK Electoral Commission has opened an investigation focused on financial grants to the party.In a statement, the commission said grant funding from the European Union can be used by a political party to help pay for things like campaign costs connected to European elections -- but cannot be used to fund national parties, election candidates or a range of other purposes.The commission added that after receiving information from the European Parliament it will look into whether UKIP broke UK election law.CNN's Milena Veselinovic contributed to this report","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/world/donald-trump-nigel-farage-us-ambassador/index.html"}

{"_id":"Nigerian footballer cycles 100km balancing a ball on his head","articleText":" (CNN)A Nigerian man has cycled 100km while balancing a ball on his head. Harrison Chinedu , a footballer, cycled a total of 103.6 kilometers across Lagos without dropping the ball. Chinedu may have broken the Guinness World Record for the farthest distance traveled with a football on the head. If successful, he will not only break an existing record, he would also have created a new one. It will take around 90 days for the Guinness World Record body to verify and confirm the results. Chinedu, who played professional football in Cambodia, told CNN he discovered the skill during his 10-year professional football career. He said he then read about the Guinness World Record and set out to do something extraordinary. \"I did it because I wish to share my God-given talent to the world and to encourage the young ones to do something that has never been done before,\" he said in a phone interview from his home in Lagos. According to Chinedu, the most challenging part of his trip was cycling on the Eko bridge, one of the three bridges connecting the Lagos mainland and Lagos Island. It sits over the Lagos lagoon and is 3.43 kilometers long. He said he found it tough to maintain balance with the high wind speed on the bridge.Chinedu said with the help of policemen and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officers he was able to navigate through heavy traffic, bumps and potholes on the road.Responding to critics who have said he could not have kept the ball on his head because of the poor state of some Lagos roads, Chinedu shrugged it off and said he had simply mastered the art. \"Pedaling the bicycle, controlling the ball, watching for traffic- its all calculation,\" he said. His first attempt to appear on the Guinness Book of World Records was eight months ago in March this year. He walked a total distance of 48.08km for 6 hours and 15 minutes while balancing a football on his head. An Indian soldier, Naib Singh, who walked a total distance of 45.64 km in 2014, previously held the record. Chinedu posted this picture of the certificate he claims he received from the Guinness World Records.\"This is one record created by me and I am happy that I have done my own side,\" Chinedu said.

{"_id":"Nigerian officers killed 150 peaceful protesters, Amnesty report claims","articleText":" (CNN)Nigerian security forces have killed at least 150 people in a series of attacks against the largely peaceful pro-Biafra secessionist movement, according to a report by Amnesty International. The report finds \"overwhelming evidence that Nigerian security forces committed gross human rights violations\" at a number of public gatherings in the country's southern region since August 2015.In what the human rights group calls \"a chilling campaign,\" security forces were apparently responsible for the extrajudicial killings, detentions, and torture of supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a group that is pushing for an independent Biafran state in Nigeria's oil-rich southeast.\"This deadly repression of pro-Biafra activists is further stoking tensions in the southeast of Nigeria,\" said Makmid Kamara, Interim Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.\"This reckless and trigger-happy approach to crowd control has caused at least 150 deaths and we fear the actual total might be far higher,\" Kamara said.Security force abusesThe report was based on the analysis of 87 videos and 122 photographs, along with 146 witness interviews.It states that many of the abuses occurred around the Biafra Remembrance Day celebrations on May 30, 2016, in Onitsha, Anambra State. Security forces raided homes the night before the event and then opened fire the next day with live ammunition on a crowd of approximately 1,000 people, the report says. A 26-year-old man interviewed in the report said was at the rally when he was shot and then hid from security forces in a gutter. He said that when soldiers found him they poured acid on him.\"I covered my face. I would have been blind by now,\" he told Amnesty International. \"He poured acid on my hands. My hands and body started burning. The flesh was burning... They dragged me out of the gutter. They said I'll die slowly.\" The report acknowledges that some protesters threw stones, burned tires and in at least one incident, shot at police.\"These acts of violence and disorder did not justify the level of force used against the whole assembly,\" the report reads.Government response Nigerian military spokesman Colonel Sani Usman said: \"We wish to debunk the insinuation that our troops perpetrated the killing of defenseless agitators. This is an outright attempt to tarnish the reputation of the security forces in general and the Nigerian Army in particular, for whatever inexplicable parochial reasons.\"For umpteenth times, the Nigerian Army has informed the public about the heinous intent of this Non-Governmental Organisation,\" Usman added, \"which is never relenting in dabbling into our national security in manners that obliterate objectivity, fairness and simple logic.\" The Biafra call for independence The Biafra movement calls for an independent state in the majority Igbo region in Nigeria's oil producing southeast. Supporters of the independence movement claim the region has been marginalized from government participation and development.The Igbo are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa's most populous nation, and their historical grievances carry over after the Nigerian Civil War, which started in 1967 and was largely fought to repress the Igbo secessionist movement. The Igbo lost the war, which ended in 1970.  For more than a year the IPOB have been staging a series of rallies seeking the establishment of a Biafran state. Protests intensified in October 2015 when Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB, was arrested.  He remains in detention. Call for investigation The rights group calls for reparation for the victims as well as impartial investigations into those who perpetrated the abuses, which it says have not been adequately addressed by Nigerian authorities.\"Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the government of Nigeria to initiate independent investigations into evidence of crimes under international law, and President (Muhammadu) Buhari has repeatedly promised that Amnesty International's reports would be looked into,\" said Amnesty's Kamara.However, \"no concrete steps have been taken,\" he said.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/africa/nigeria-security-forces-biafra-protesters/index.html"}

{"_id":"North Korea claims successful test of nuclear warhead ","articleText":" (CNN)North Korea said it hit the button on its fifth and potentially most powerful nuclear test Friday morning, claiming to have successfully detonated a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on ballistic rockets.State media said the test would enable North Korea to produce \"a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power.\"  \"It's hard for us to verify their claim. My deep fear is that they will launch a live nuclear weapon on one of their missiles, but that would be extremely dangerous as that could trigger a war,\" said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.World leaders condemned the test, saying it was a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The Security Council met and \"strongly condemned\" the test as \"a clear threat to international peace and security.\"\"The members of the Security Council also recalled that they have previously expressed their determination to take further significant measures in the event of another Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear test,\" the Security Council statement said. \"In line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin to work immediately on appropriate measures. ...\"U.S. President Barack Obama warned North Korea that it will face \"consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.\" Obama said he spoke to the leaders of South Korea and Japan by phone, and that they agreed to \"take additional significant steps, including new sanctions.\"\"To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state,\" Obama said in a statement.The blast, detected about 9 a.m. local time (8:30 p.m. ET) in the area of North Korea's Punggye-ri underground test site, is estimated to have had the explosive power of 10 kilotons, almost twice as large as the most recent test in January, said Kim Nam-wook of South Korea's Meteorological Administration.  The test comes on North Korea's national day, and six months after it claimed it had miniaturized nuclear warheads to fit on ballistic missiles. At the same time, South Korea is negotiating an expected deployment of a US missile defense system -- a plan that Pyongyang has decried as provocative.'Fanatically reckless'South Korean President Park Geun-hye called Kim Jong Un's regime \"fanatically reckless.\"  \"The only thing that (the) Kim Jong Un regime can gain from the nuclear tests is stronger sanctions from the international community and its isolation. Such provocation will eventually hasten its path to self-destruction,\" she said in a statement. Sanctions against the regime, including ones targeting the North Korean leader personally, have had little effect. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" if North Korea had conducted another nuclear test.Obama, who just returned from Asia, called the test a grave threat to international security. He said he reaffirmed to Park and Abe the \"unshakeable US commitment to take necessary steps to defend our allies in the region,\" including through the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system in South Korea.Same location as other testsSeismic activity was detected near Punggye-ri, the underground site used in the other four tests. The US Geological Survey reported a 5.3-magnitude earthquake but later termed it an explosion. \"We are currently analyzing whether it was a successful test,\" a South Korean National Defense Ministry official told CNN.Satellite images had shown new activity at the test site in recent weeks, according to North Korea monitoring site 38North. A small number of mining carts could be seen, as well as a new canopy designed to hide activity to the site, analysts said.How close is North Korea to mounting a nuclear warhead?North Korea has continued to improve its nuclear and missile capabilities, but it has yet to pair the two successfully. However, concern has been growing that the country is testing weapons at an unprecedented pace this year, CNN international correspondent Paula Hancocks said. South Korea worries that Pyongyang is progressing toward its goal of mounting a nuclear warhead to ballistic missiles \"faster than previously estimated,\" a South Korean lawmaker told reporters.Kim Byung-kee of the opposition Minjoo Party made the remark after attending a meeting with South Korean intelligence officials.

{"_id":"Oakland fire kills at least 9 at warehouse party","articleText":"Oakland, California (CNN)After a day's worth of investigations, Oakland authorities were continuing to search for answers on Sunday regarding the fast-spreading deadly fire that engulfed a warehouse during an electronic dance concert. They want to know about the rickety stairway. They want to know about the lack of permits. They also want to know: Could this tragedy have been avoided?At least nine people died in the fire as scores of others escaped Friday night. But the fates of more than two dozen people were still unknown Saturday evening one day after the blaze that gutted the two-story warehouse.Friends and family used every available tool -- phones and social media among them -- in the frantic effort to find out whether their loved ones were alive. People like 27-year-old painter Bob Mulé, who lost his friend to the fire, were left to grapple with the nightmare of that fiery night.\"I felt my skin melting,\" Mulé said. \"I tried to save my friend but I had to leave him.\"Impact Your World: How to helpThe Oakland Fire Department fears the fire may have burned up to 40 people in a structure that housed artists' studios and stored so many things that the housing department had notified property owners of violations for trash and debris.'You could feel the heat of the flames'By the time John Evanofski arrived at 31st Avenue, where an electronic music DJ known as Golden Donna was scheduled to perform, giant flames lit up the night sky amid the billows of black smoke.\"You could feel the heat of the flames,\" he told CNN. \"Most of us were crying or unable to react. It was so hot and so terrible knowing that so many of us were still inside.\"Freelance journalist Sam Lefebvre said many people were just getting there as the fire started since the dance party was supposed to go very late.Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Graves said 40 out of an estimated 100 people may have died. However, he cautioned that some people may have ended up at hospitals or made it out alive with friends. Later on, officials said the death toll might be in the dozens.Initially, authorities recovered nine bodies and rushed their fingerprints to a lab in an attempt to identify the victims, an Alameda County Sheriff's Office coroner spokesman said. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said emergency responders found most victims on the second floor given that the pallet stairway had become  inacessible.Evanofski was one of the lucky ones in a building filled with artists. His friend, who did nails, wasn't as fortunate, he said.\"She is one of the most magical people I've ever met,\" he said..'Immense tragedy'Calling the fire an \"immense tragedy,\" Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf pledged to get a \"full accounting\" that could be shared with the public as quickly as possible.There was another question on authorities' minds: How did the first start in the first place?The building is a \"sort of live/work art space with a lot of old decorations and furniture,\" Lefebvre, the freelance journalist, told CNN. Photos posted on a blog showed elaborate wooden structures inside the building before the fire. Some of them include beds and living room furniture. Reed described the interior as one that had partitions that divided space among several artists. She said she has heard reports that some people may have been living there but it remained unclear how many people lived there.\"Inside is just a wide assortment of just ... everything. Furniture, mannequins, statues. Just a lot of stuff inside,\" she told CNN. Darin Ranelletti, Oakland's interim director of planning and building, told reporters Saturday the city had only approved permits for the building to be used as a warehouse -- not for residences. City officials also had not signed off on a special permit for the event, Ranelletti said.Last month the warehouse property owners had received notification of code violations for hazardous trash and debris, property records show. Officials had not yet completed an investigation into a November complaint for an illegal interior building structure..A city inspector tried to enter the warehouse November 17 but was unable to make a visual inspection inside, Ranelletti said.In addition, firefighters found no evidence of sprinklers in the warehouse. CNN has reached out to the property owners for comment. Johnna Watson, Oakland police spokeswoman, said the building is not deemed a crime scene but it is still early in the investigation. 'It's too unsafe' for emergency respondersTo find loved ones, people used the event's Facebook page Saturday to post names of potential show attendees. For those who survived, they also shared their names to show they were safe.Twenty-five people are unaccounted for, as reported by people who either escaped the fire or believe they knew someone who was there, Reed said.Terry Lightfoot, a representative of Oakland's Highland Hospital, told CNN the hospital received two patients and one of them has been discharged. Lightfoot said he did not know the condition of the patient who remained hospitalized.Firefighters have not been able to search the entire building, where the roof collapsed onto the second floor and parts continued down onto the ground level.Crews, possibly with heavy equipment, first have to shore up walls and make sure the building is safe.\"There's limited access to the structure,\" Reed told CNN affiliate KRON-TV in San Francisco. \"It's too unsafe. And not only that, there's a lot of heavy wood from when the roof caved in that's going to have to be removed.\"'I had to let him go'For Bob Mulé, the warehouse wasn't just the site of a large dance party, it was both his home and his community. Mulé told CNN more than 20 people living in the warehouse, which he described as a \"collective artists' community,\" paid rent and were all involved in the creation of the space.On Friday night, Mule stopped upstairs to listen to some music he described as a \"very tame setting.\" Afterward, he headed downstairs to work on a painting. From his studio, he smelled smoke, which led him to investigate the source.  After seeing the flames, Mulé ran to find a fire extinguisher. He found one, and tried to pull the pin, but struggled mightily. After a little while, he turned back to save his camera and laptop. At that point, Mulé spotted a fellow artist who called out for help. Mulé suspected that heavy-set artist had broken his ankle after falling from the second floor. He tried to save him.Nearly 100 killed in Rhode Island nightclub inferno\"I was pulling him out,\" said Mulé, who sustained burns from the fire, later wrapped in bandages. \"The flames were too much. There was too much smoke and ... I had to let him go.\"More than 40 people gathered Saturday at Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland for a vigil. Organizers asked attendees to light a candle at the end of the service, saying flames caused pain and destruction \"but tonight we light the flame for good and for peace.\" Now, as loved ones await answers in the coming days, Mulé must wrestle with the reality of losing a friend he couldn't save and the likelihood that the official deatTheh toll may climb. \"I'm glad I'm alive,\" Mulé said.

{"_id":"Obama administration could be looking to bolster Iran nuclear deal in final months","articleText":" (CNN)In a bid to secure the Iran nuclear deal before President Barack Obama leaves office, his administration is working to stave off any additional sanctions and encouraging American companies to do business with Iran, a US official told CNN.The moves have already met with opposition on Capitol Hill with the Republican leadership in the House sending a letter Tuesday to Obama asking his administration to cease efforts to facilitate companies doing business with Iran during the transition period.\"We respectfully request that your administration take no further actions designed to bolster international investment in Iran,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce wrote.\"President-elect Trump deserves the opportunity to assess United States policy toward Iran without your administration imposing or implementing additional measures that could complicate the incoming administration's ability to develop its policy,\" they added.A senior State Department official who is involved in the negotiations told CNN that there was \"no specific effort to seal things irretrievably before the end of the term, rather just to keep meeting our commitments under the JCPOA,\" using the acronym for the accord. The official added that the administration is not seeking to roll back any existing sanctions but is hoping to prevent the Republican-controlled Congress from extending the Iran Sanctions Act beyond 10 years. The administration's actions were first reported in the Wall Street Journal.The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to extend the act for another 10 years last week. The act sanctions Iran for its support of terrorist organizations but also grants the President the authority to levy additional sanctions on Tehran if it is found to be violating the terms of the nuclear deal.The official said that the US had also bolstered its efforts to attempt to sway US companies to do more business in Iran as part of a bid to secure Iran's continued adherence to the accord.RELATED: Donald Trump's first 100 days: A breakdown of his planEarlier this month Secretary of State John Kerry briefed a number of firms in London to help explain how US companies can invest in Iran, educating them as to what type of business they can do there and what types of business they cannot.The renewed push the official explained was due to Iranians who support the deal, like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, telling the US that Iranian hardliners may attempt to kill the deal unless its benefits become more apparent within Iran. The State Department has previously publicly acknowledged actions it has taken to help explain to US companies how they can do business in Iran while avoiding some of the non-nuclear related sanctions that remain in place. These administration's efforts come as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office in January. Trump has indicated he may be willing to scrap the deal on his first day in office, something his political ally, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said was possible.\"I would advise Donald Trump to do exactly what he said...which is to dismantle that disastrous deal,\" Cotton said last week at the Defense One Summit in Washington.   White House spokesman Josh Earnest addressed these reports on Tuesday, saying, \"I can confirm for you that I do not anticipate any actions being taken that were initiated after the election solely in response to Mr. Trump's victory.\"\"Any actions that are taken, if there are any, are the kinds of actions that have been in the pipeline for quite some time and are entirely consistent with the United States upholding our end of an agreement that has prevented Iran from developing their nuclear weapon capability,\" he added.RELATED: Trump overseas business interests subject to new scrutinyAsked about reports of renewed efforts to strengthen the accord, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a spokesman for the State Department said Monday that there were no new decisions to announce.\"Obviously, we're going to stay committed to meeting our JCPOA commitments and obviously continue to believe that the Iran deal is the right thing for the country and for our interests,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/obama-iran-nuclear-deal/index.html"}

{"_id":"Obama hands off legacy on terror to sharp critic ","articleText":" (CNN)A commander in chief who prizes nuance and restraint put his legacy in the war on terror Tuesday in the hands of a brassy successor who embodies gut-check leadership.Forty-five days before the inauguration, Barack Obama and Donald Trump struck a contrast that not only reflected their chalk-and-cheese political styles, but their radically different doctrines for how best to keep America safe.Obama traveled to MacDill Air Force Base in Florida to bid a poignant farewell to his troops. He offered one of his characteristic, professorial examinations of his own motives, place in history and responses to the threat from terrorism that has evolved but hardly waned during his eight years in office.At almost the same time, the President-elect stood beaming in the cabin of his personal 757 alongside James Mattis, the retired general he will formally unveil later Tuesday in North Carolina as his pick for defense secretary and whom Trump delights in calling by his nickname, \"Mad Dog.\"RELATED: Obama touts counterterror legacy, admits \"threat will endure\"More comfortable with an explosive tweet and a swipe at what he considers to be the Obama administration's fecklessness on terrorism than public self-examination, Trump has promised to break Obama's mold when he enters the White House.But the outgoing commander in chief made the case that his successor should adopt many of his approaches and issued a forceful, implicit appeal to Trump to keep the fight against terror in what he sees as its proper perspective.\"The whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing the nature of who we are and our democracy,\" Obama told the troops, without mentioning Trump by name.\"The fact is, people and nations do not make good decisions when they are driven by fear,\" he said, in an apparent plea to Trump not to embrace tactics used by the George W. Bush administration that much of his own presidency was dedicated to overturning and outlawing.In his last major national security address, Obama argued that he had placed the US anti-terror campaign on more sustainable ground, morally, legally and militarily than it was on when he took office in January 2009.RELATED: Trump and China on collision courseIn defending his decision to ban interrogation methods critics label torture, his efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and his withdrawal from Middle East battlefields, the President appeared to be directly addressing his successor: \"Right makes might, not the other way around.\"Obama said he was indeed right to pull troops out of Iraq and to end combat in Afghanistan, to forge a nuclear deal with Iran and celebrated the operation that killed Osama bin Laden.Eying Republicans who blame him for the rise of ISIS, Obama touted the success of the US-backed offensive against the terror group in Iraq and Syria and argued he had mandated greater transparency on the way America uses drones.While he pointed out that there had been no attack on the scale of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks during his tenure, Obama acknowledged the new wave of radicalized homegrown terrorists inspired by ISIS like those in San Bernardino, California, or Orlando, Florida.Leaving power means that Obama has no idea -- or control -- over whether those who come after him will build on the foundation he believes he has left.Trump lashed Obama's approach as \"disastrous\" on the campaign trail, and vowed to launch an all-encompassing struggle reminiscent of the generations-long duel between the West and Communism.He plans to crack down on Muslim immigration, to intensify the fight against ISIS and has threatened to bring back waterboarding -- although there are signs he may have backed off that promise after meeting Mattis.Trump, without revealing his plans, has vowed to be far more aggressive in combating terror and has warned he will renegotiate Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.On the face of it, Trump's fixation with strength and his own ferocious rhetoric -- as well as the appointment of vehement Obama critic, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, as his national security adviser -- suggests an immediate change of course.And yet, the world often looks different from inside the Oval Office, and despite the clear temperamental and rhetorical gulf between the two men, it remains unclear how much of the Obama legacy Trump will tear down.RELATED: US-Iran nuclear deal: Iran's President warns Trump not to ruin agreementIt could turn out Trump will decide that the combination of drone strikes, the scalpel of special forces raids and using local forces to combat ISIS -- policies Obama has pursued -- are the most effective options.And new legal constraints introduced over the Obama years on interrogations of terror suspects combined with the political and military constraints imposed by years of grueling foreign wars might all combine to box Trump in.\"There is no question that President Obama was determined to make the US counter-terrorism policy sustainable -- not only in terms of the resources that we were putting into it but sustainable in terms of the legal basis in which we had been operating,\" said Derek Chollet, who served as a senior official in the Obama Pentagon and White House.Chollet added that one reason Obama gave the speech Tuesday was to explain what he had done, to defend it and to show why going after terrorists in line with the rule of law was the preferable path.\"There is a lot that Donald Trump personally, or those around him, have said that would very much go against what President Obama has been talking about,\" he noted. \"But like on every other policy issue, we are not going to really know what direction this is going to take until Donald Trump takes office.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/politics/obama-trump-terrorism-views/index.html"}

{"_id":"Obama leaves Europe with little certitude","articleText":"Berlin (CNN)When Barack Obama introduced himself to the world in 2008, he stood in the sprawling Tiergarten here, packed with Berliners waving American flags, and declared that walls — metaphoric divides of ethnicity, gender, religion, and race — were crumbling.Thursday, as he stood on the opposite end of the park inside the German chancellery, the mood was darker. The man replacing him is readying plans to build a physical wall on the US border. A wash of populist nationalism has dampened prospects of steady cooperation.Bidding farewell in the same city he proclaimed his \"hope and change\" vision loudest, Obama instead warned of a dimmer change encroaching. \"There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else's problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient,\" he said. \"If we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world. We will go backwards instead of forwards.\"The forces he described spreading across nations — cynical, uncaring, politically craven shadows — mirror almost exactly his pre-election descriptions of Donald Trump, views he says haven't changed in the days since he met with the President-elect in the Oval Office.As he departed Europe Friday underneath a persistent cold drizzle, Obama left behind few firm assurances that the continent's greatest fears aren't well-founded.\"The voice that helps to steer the world away from war, wherever possible, that's our voice more often than not,\" Obama said during his final remarks in Europe as President. \"And we're not always successful but if that voice is absent or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world.\"On Friday, Obama met with his closest western allies and found a collection of counterparts in varying stages of political strife. France's Francois Hollande is suffering record-low approval ratings as he gears up for a re-election bid. Italy's Matteo Renzi has vowed to leave government if his proposed constitutional reforms fail next month. Britain's Theresa May has her attention squarely on how to remove her country from the European Union without prompting a financial disaster. Even Angela Merkel, the German chancellor upon whom Obama piled praise, will face a challenge from the right if she decides to run for a fourth term. Obama left little doubt where he stood on her reelection prospects Thursday, saying he'd vote for her if he could.Merkel, in her fashion, offered a tightly constrained view of the road ahead. She said she approached Trump's presidency with an \"open mind,\" leaving the unknown details about the future of the relationship unsaid.In a readout of his meeting, the White House said Obama and fellow leaders agreed to continue sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and urged them to continue intelligence sharing programs to counter extremism.He also reaffirmed, yet again, his commitment to democratic values \"at a moment of great change,\" urging the leaders \"to continue seeking solutions to common challenges with the incoming US administration on the basis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies.\"Obama planned his final stops in Europe as a valedictory return after a rancid political campaign, meant to cement his legacy here while assuring leaders and ordinary people the progressive message he proclaimed in 2008 was now being realized by a Democratic successor.That was before Trump won in a surprise victory.Now, the assurances Europeans want — promises of stability and an end to the unease gripping this continent — Obama is not prepared to deliver.On core areas of cooperation, there's scant confidence about a way forward. Obama can't say, for example, that the Iran nuclear agreement will continue as written. He's not positioned to vow US commitment to the Paris climate accord going forward. Perhaps most worrying to his European allies, there's little he can say with certitude about Trump's plans for checking Russia's aggressions.After an hour and a half with Trump last week, Obama was able to glean the President-elect's commitment to preserving NATO ties, a statement Obama repeated in nearly every set of public remarks he delivered in Greece and Germany.But elsewhere, on deeper matters, there's little he can say with honesty about the road ahead.He still feels Trump is unfit for office, he's suggested, though no longer says so out loud. He remains concerned about the rhetoric the candidate espoused on the trail, but is \"cautiously optimistic\" he'll tone things down once he's in the Oval Office. And he can no longer say with any confidence the nationalist wave that landed Trump in the White House won't take firmer hold here.Even as Obama was standing at the Acropolis in Greece hailing the ancient wisdom of democracy, the French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen was declaring an end to the globalized vision he's worked to advance.\"Donald Trump has made possible what was presented as completely impossible,\" Le Pen told CNN in an interview Tuesday. \"So it's a sign of hope for those who cannot bear wild globalization. They cannot bear the political life led by the elites.\"Obama, too, has warned against the pitfalls of globalization. But his message has shifted from 2008, when he warned of those \"left behind in a globalized world\" during his speech in Berlin.Back then, he was advocating for the world's forgotten corners — dissidents in Burma, children in Bangladesh, refugees in Chad. These days, it's the disenfranchised voters who tilted toward Trump who he says must be eased into an interconnected world.\"If people feel that they're losing control of their future, they will push back,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/obama-europe-germany-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Obama offers 'wait and see' approach to Trump, but adds he'll be watching ","articleText":"LIMA, Peru (CNN)President Barack Obama in his final press conference abroad advised the world to \"take a wait and see approach\" for what a Donald Trump presidency may mean in terms of policy, but added that he would weigh in if the \"ideals\" of the country are called into question. Obama, while speaking in Lima, Peru on the final day of his last trip abroad, spent the majority of his trip answering questions on what a Trump presidency will mean for international allies -- including America's influence globally. Obama -- concluding the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima -- acknowledged that he wouldn't hesitate to play critic in a Trump presidency if \"necessary.\"\"I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance,\" Obama said. \"If there's specifics that have less to do with some proposal or battle but goes to the core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideal then I'll examine it when it comes.\" The President also reiterated that while he \"can't guarantee\" that Trump won't pursue some of the positions he's taken on the campaign trail, the President said reality would \"force\" Trump to \"adjust\" how he approaches those issues in office. Obama also stressed the importance of the US influence in the world, saying that no other country is able to \"fill the void.\" \"We're not going to be able to solve every problem... but if we're not on the side of what's right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it even if sometimes we're not able to deliver it 100% everywhere, then it collapses,\" President Obama told reporters.\"There's nobody to fill the void. There really isn't,\" he said.Obama did acknowledge that other countries such as China are \"very important,\" but said they do not contribute on the same scale. Pointing to the example of the Paris Climate Agreement saying, \"China's not the one who was going around organizing 200 nations to sign on.\" Obama's advice to TrumpWhile declining to directly respond to a question about how Trump should handle potential conflicts of interest in the White House due to his business dealings, Obama talked about what he did upon being elected in 2008. That included liquidating assets that might have raised questions about possibly influencing policy. Obama also stressed following both the letter and spirit of the law and repeated that he is \"extremely proud\" that his administration hasn't had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other administrations. Pull aside with PutinPresident Obama said Sunday that in his brief chat with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Peru, that Russian influence on the election was not discussed because the campaign was over. \"That's behind us,\" Obama said. Obama, answering a question on whether cyber influences on elections are the \"new norms\" said as long as there was a responsible press and an \"engaged citizenry then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much.\" \"If generally we've got an election that isn't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the inside,\" he said. \"The issue is what are we doing to ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something we have control over.\"Obama called the four-minute conversation with Putin \"candid and courteous,\" which included discussions on Syria and Ukraine in which the President said he conveyed that he was \"deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sewn by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military.\" Defense of the Democratic PartyPresident Obama in Lima took up a strong defense of the Democratic Party, saying that he wasn't \"worried about being the last Democratic president.\" Obama added he he wasn't saying that to be a \"cute\" point to the popular vote, which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won despite coming up short against Trump in the all-important Electoral College count.  Obama, however, conceded that following Clinton's surprising defeat, Democrats \"have to do some thinking\" about their message. But the President said he didn't believe \"there has to be a complete overhaul.\"Obama also defended the political skill of House Minority Leader Pelosi, but did not weigh in on the challenge to her leadership position in Congress. The longtime California Democrat is facing a leadership fight from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio.Obama said that the current minority leader \"combines strong progressive values with just extraordinary political skill; and she does stuff that's tough. Not just stuff that's easy.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/barack-obama-donald-trump-transition/index.html"}
{"_id":"Obama touts counterterror legacy, admits \"threat will endure\"","articleText":"Go inside the election that changed everything: Order your copy of CNN's book \"Unprecedented,\" and explore CNN's coverage of \"A race like no other.\" Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama reaffirmed his counterterrorism strategy in his final national security speech Tuesday, issuing a tacit warning to his successor that reversing course could result in dire consequences.Cautioning against using torture to obtain information and making another pitch for closing the naval prison at Guantanamo Bay, Obama argued against the very promises Donald Trump made during his run for president. Obama warned that returning to those practices would ultimately damage US national security.\"Adhering to the rule of law is not a weakness in the long term, it is our greatest strength,\" Obama said during an address at MacDill Air Force Base, the Florida headquarters of US Central Command and Special Operations Command. \"The whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing the nature of who we are and our democracy. And the fact is, people and nations do not make good decisions when they are driven by fear.\"Defending his ban on torture, Obama said, \"At no time has anybody told me it cost us good intelligence.\"And he called the Guantanamo Bay prison a \"blot on our national honor.\"During the presidential campaign, Trump argued for a more aggressive approach to combating terrorism, including reintroducing torture techniques such as waterboarding for interrogations, and banning Muslims from entering the US. He's also said he would resume placing suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.White House officials said Obama's speech Tuesday was planned ahead of Trump's win in November's election and was not meant as a message for Trump. But the President's remarks Tuesday provided a clear counterpoint to Trump's national security rhetoric.He pushed back against pressure to label certain terrorists as \"radical Islamist,\" saying that risks stigmatizing \"good, patriotic Muslims.\"\"That just feeds the terrorists' narrative and fuels the same false grievances that they use to motivate people to kill,\" he said.And he called bids to scrap his diplomatic achievements, including the Iran nuclear deal, a win for the enemy.\"Terrorists would love to see us walk away from the type of work that builds international coalitions and ends conflicts and stops the spread of deadly weapons,\" Obama said. \"It would make life easier for them. It would be a tragic mistake for us.\"The speech was billed by the White House as a wrap-up of Obama's national security priorities over his eight years in office. That tenure has included successes like the end to large-scale troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden, but also new challenges like the rise of ISIS and its threats to Europe and the US homeland.Sources: Trump transition team requested security clearance for Flynn Jr.The President acknowledged that the danger of terrorism is a long-term one, saying \"the threat will endure\" and needs a sustainable plan of attack.\"We have to pursue a smart strategy,\" he said.But he also conceded that the war against terrorism wouldn't have a satisfying ending, at least in the model of more traditional combat missions.\"We will not achieve the kind of clearly defined victory comparable to those that we won in previous wars against nations,\" Obama said. As part of his visit to the Tampa military installation Tuesday, Obama met with Special Operations troops, the elite forces who have carried out some of the more significant missions of his tenure. He argued for an approach that has relied heavily on those special operators to carry out surgical missions to take out terrorists, as well as train local forces to combat ISIS.He also again addressed the use of drones to take out terrorists, a program that's drawn legal scrutiny and outrage in countries that have been targeted. He said critics should weigh alternatives like airstrikes, which he said were more likely to cause civilian or US military deaths.Obama spoke the same day Trump officially announced retired Gen. James Matthis as his pick to lead the Pentagon, and as speculation ramps up about the President-elect's selection for secretary of state. In his remarks, Obama offered a guiding principle for the incoming administration.\"I always remind myself that, as commander in chief, I must protect our people, but I also swore an oath to defend our constitution. And over these last eight years we've demonstrated that staying true to our traditions as a nation of laws advances our security as well as our values,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/politics/obama-terrorism-security-military-tampa/index.html"}
{"_id":"Obama's counterterrorism adviser on threats facing Trump administration","articleText":"Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor at Arizona State University. He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\" (CNN)President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser said that she believes the United States and its allies are winning the war against ISIS and that the incoming Trump team needs to guard against the possibility of terrorism during the early part of the administration.Lisa Monaco oversees a team of some 50 senior directors and other officials at the White House who are focused on counterterrorism, cybersecurity and homeland security. Monaco and her team guide a wide range of American policies -- from the fight against ISIS, to how to guard against hackers on key infrastructure in the States, to how to mitigate the effect of emerging diseases. Monaco previously ran the National Security Division at the US Department of Justice, which is in charge of prosecuting terrorism and espionage cases, and before then she was chief of staff at the FBI. We sat down Thursday at the Defense One Summit in Washington to talk about the Trump transition and the fact that its \"landing teams\" have not been in touch as yet with her or her team; the possibility that Guantanamo Bay will go back into service for suspected terrorists, including, perhaps, for American citizens; and the possibility that coercive interrogations of terrorism suspects could be reinstituted. Monaco gave her assessment of the war against ISIS -- the group is losing and badly in her view --- as well as how other jihadist groups are faring, including the continuing long-term threat posed by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and what she believes the next administration needs to worry about most, including the possibility of a terrorist attack early in the Trump presidency. We also discussed what the US intelligence community has determined to be Russian cyberattacks on elements of the American electoral system during the presidential campaign. The discussion has been edited for both clarity and brevity:Peter Bergen: The Trump transition: Have they been in touch with you?Lisa Monaco: Not me personally. We are ready to carry out the President's directions. The President's been very clear with his team that we are going to conduct a professional, smooth, comprehensive transition.  Bergen: Given the fact that President-elect Trump's campaign was very bound up with the issue of terrorism, is it surprising they haven't been in touch with you yet? After all you are the top counterterrorism official in the country. Monaco: What's important to understand is there is a process put in place. It's now preserved in statute -- the transition statute. There's a White House Transition Coordinating Council, of which I am a member, and we have had a number of meetings to facilitate the transition. Now that we have the President-elect and his team there are a number of steps they have to take to be ready to receive classified information, not only from the National Security Council but also across the government. No (Trump) \"landing teams\" have gone into any of these agencies while those final steps are being taken. Bergen: The landing teams -- they would need to have top secret clearances to be briefed?Monaco: It will vary, depending on what type of information they're receiving, but certainly individuals who come into the National Security Council, the Defense Department, CIA, will have to have appropriate clearances in order to receive information. Bergen: And you have no idea who your successor may be? Monaco: I do not. Bergen: When you meet with him or her for the first time, what are the most important pieces of advice, or warning, that you would give that person? Monaco: What's going to be critical for my successor is to make sure you're focused on the very complex and wide-ranging array of threats that we face today. It's everything from terrorist threats, cyber threats, emerging infectious diseases. It's an extremely complex environment in which we're operating, and so I will be walking my successor through that landscape. But, broadly speaking, I'll also try to impart, the types of things I think they should be focused on: building a good team, making sure you're asking questions, trusting your instincts, and then, personally, I would instruct him or her to live close by because you're going to spend a lot of time in your office. And I would also advise that person to stock up on Vitamin D because, as you know, I occupy a windowless office in the West Wing of the White House, and when I'm not there, I spend the rest of my time in a windowless Situation Room, so he or she will need to get comfortable with that.From Guantanamo to MosulBergen: The Obama administration has not sent prisoners to Guantanamo at all, right?Monaco: That's correct.Bergen: So, there's nothing preventing the new president from sending prisoners to Guantanamo, including American citizens, potentially, as was discussed in the campaign?Monaco: The President-elect has spoken on the campaign trail about keeping Guantanamo open. That's obviously not President Obama's view, it's not this administration's view, and from a policy perspective, there's nothing to stop the next administration from keeping Guantanamo open. Bergen: Right, and similarly with so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, sometimes referred to as torture, the new head of the CIA could bring back enhanced interrogation?Monaco: As a policy matter, I suppose that's possible. President Obama issued an executive order -- one of the first executive orders he issued -- when he came into office banning torture and banning enhanced interrogation techniques and taking the CIA out of the detention business. That structure was broadly codified in a statute last year.Bergen: But, presumably, you could find a lawyer in the White House to write a memo that said certain enhanced interrogation techniques didn't rise to the level of torture.Monaco: That wouldn't be a lawyer in the White House as a matter of executive branch practice. It would be a lawyer in the Justice Department in the Office of Legal Counsel, which opines on the definitive view of the law for the executive branch.                   Is ISIS winning?Bergen: Some have claimed that ISIS is winning. What's your view?Monaco: I disagree with that.Bergen: Because?Monaco: I disagree with that pretty profoundly, actually, because, what has distinguished ISIL (another acronym for ISIS) is that it has operated as a hybrid threat -- an insurgent army; a terror group, directing attacks like we saw in Paris and in Brussels; and as a social phenomenon, using social media to spew venom. On all three dimensions, ISIL is absolutely losing. They're being rolled back from territory that they used to occupy in Iraq and Syria, losing some 50% of the territory that they used to occupy. As a terrorist group, they're on the run. The Defense Department has taken down a number of very senior leaders. And, in the social media space and in the messaging space, we have retooled our approach, whether it's with our counter-messaging tools or by engaging with the private sector.Companies like Twitter have really scaled up their actions to stop ISIL from exploiting and abusing their platforms. The numbers I've seen recently is over the last year, year and a half; some 360,000 terrorist accounts, have been disrupted and taken down. That's 1,000 accounts per day. And places like Google are putting in place very kind of new and innovative ideas to redirect those who are searching for ISIL content to other content. So I think we've got them on the run, for sure.Bergen: Is the threat level here in the United States and also in Europe declining? And also, with the transition and the new presidency --- we saw 9/11 happened early in Bush's presidency and we saw the \"underwear bomber\" plot early in Obama's presidency -- are you concerned about something happening in the early days of the new administration? Monaco: Well I'm always concerned about something happening, and that's pretty much what I get paid for. But I think it's a fair question. And it's one of the reasons we are so focused on a smooth and professional and comprehensive transition. Because, particularly in the national security, homeland security, counterterrorism space, there needs to be a clear transition of what we know and what we're doing and how we're going about taking the fight to terrorists. We always have to be concerned. They are relentlessly focused on attacking the United States. We're all vulnerable to (ISIS-inspired attacks), and that is something we are very concerned about because it's much harder to detect. How do you know when something goes wrong in somebody's head and will inspire them to act? That person doesn't have to travel to get training and then travel back to conduct an attack. Bergen: Clearly ISIS is in the process of losing (the Iraqi city of) Mosul; it might be a few weeks away. What happens to the \"foreign fighters\" (who joined ISIS from around the world) who aren't captured or killed? What is the plan? Are some getting away? Is the Turkish border really sealed? Monaco: We've made a lot of progress on sealing and moving up the defenses on the Turkish border. The Turks themselves have taken a number of steps there. So I think the inflow of foreign fighters has been greatly diminished. Bergen: What are the numbers that you're seeing now?Monaco: So, the foreign fighter numbers are down considerably over the last year, year and a half. The height, I think, over the course of the conflict, some 40,000 fighters. But we've seen over the last year a 50%, I believe, diminishment in the number of foreign fighters flowing into the theater. Now your question is the concern of, well, who's flowing out? And certainly we're concerned about ISIL moving south; we're concerned about ISIL foreign fighters traveling back and trying to flee, to conduct attacks in Europe and then, ultimately, to here. I think we have a number of defenses. The first is the ocean that separates us, so I do think Europe is more vulnerable when it comes to foreign fighter plots, as we have tragically seen in Paris and Brussels.The second is the architecture that was put in place by both the Bush administration and this administration, to shore up our travel protections, our screening mechanisms, our information sharing both within our country -- amongst our law enforcement and homeland security and intelligence communities -- and with our international foreign partners. I will be talking to my successor about continuing to focus on the information-sharing relationship with our European partners, because that is critical. Russia and the DNC hackBergen: Some have claimed that Russia wasn't behind the hacks on the Democratic National Committee. What's your view? Monaco: We've seen pretty clearly that the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security spoke to this back in October, being quite clear that the intrusions and the compromises that we believe were directed by the highest levels of the Russian government. Then we did substantial work to work with state and local governments and state and local administrators of the voting architecture and voting infrastructure in this country to shore up those systems as well.Bergen: The electoral system in this country: Is it critical infrastructure like our power grid? Should it be treated as such in that an attack on it will have a proportionate response, similar to an attack on the power grid?Monaco: I think it should be treated as such. And, in fact, we did so over the last six months as we ramped up for Election Day. Whether or not it is designated as critical infrastructure should not, I think, affect how we're treating it. The fact that it's not designated critical infrastructure does not impede what services and help that we can offer to state and local governments. And that's what we did with the run-up to the election. Bergen: I want to throw out some names of terrorist groups. Just give us a brief assessment of where they are: al Qaeda Central, the group that attacked us on 9/11?Monaco: Largely decimated. Spending more time thinking of their own security than how to plan and plot against us. But still determined.Bergen: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula based in Yemen, which carried out the underwear bomb attempt?Monaco: Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, determined, persistent, particularly when it comes to external operations and aviation plotting against the United States.Bergen: Still?Monaco: Still.Bergen: They still have their key bomb-maker?Monaco: (Bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri) is still, as far as we know, in Yemen.Bergen: Has he trained other people?Monaco: We have to be concerned about that and that's the operating assumption, but I will say they have been under relentless pressure by our operations and in coordination with what we still believe to be the legitimate government in Yemen. I will also say the turmoil and devastation that's happening there because of the internal strife between the Houthis and the deposed government of Yemen has created a vacuum that AQAP has tried to exploit.Bergen: What about Nusra (in Syria)? Are they playing a long game? (Al Nusra Front renamed itself Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham this year, but the US government continues to view it as an al Qaeda affiliate.)Monaco: I'm concerned they are trying to play a long game. Nusra is in essence al Qaeda in Syria and is now the largest al Qaeda affiliate.Bergen: How many people?Monaco: The estimates really range, but the people I'm most concerned about are the al Qaeda veterans who began a couple years ago to take up root in Syria in the ungoverned space left by (President Bashar al-Assad's) brutality on his own people to have a space to plot and plan against the United States, which is why you saw in September of 2014 that we initiated military actions to take out those leaders and to take out those plotters.This is another area where I will focus with my successor. I will argue the next team should be relentless about going after al Qaeda in Syria because we cannot let them take advantage of the chaos in Syria to mount a long game against us. Bergen: Are you concerned about a son of ISIS or the grandson of ISIS? After all, ISIS is merely the son of al Qaeda in Iraq?Monaco: I am because I am concerned about the underlying conditions that have allowed ISIL to take root. And really what that comes down to is grievances that are unaddressed and rising sectarianism across the Middle East, and until we address those issues and until those governments can get a hold of those issues I worry greatly that we and our partners have a continued challenge on our hands, which is why President Obama has taken the last eight years to put in place a sustainable, transparent counterterrorism architecture that can withstand a long game when it comes to fighting the terrorist fight. Bergen: Final question: What will you be doing on January 21, 2017?Monaco: Napping.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/politics/obama-terrorism-adviser-trump-transition-bergen/index.html"}

{"_id":"Obama's post-election glow doesn't shine on Democrats","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Barack Obama has gotten his last post-election bump as president, but perceptions of his party have moved in the opposite direction since Election Day, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Obama's approval rating in the poll stands at 57%, his highest since September 2009. That figure is on par with Ronald Reagan's approval rating shortly after the presidential election in 1988, and approaching the level reached by Bill Clinton in November 2000. Obama far outpaces George W. Bush's approval rating in November 2008, when just 24% approved of the outgoing president.Read the resultsImprovements in Obama's approval rating seem to stem largely from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Among that group of leaned Republicans, 22% now approve of Obama's job performance, up from 16% in late October. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, it has held steady at 91%.The president's favorability rating is also at its highest point since fall of 2009, with 59% saying they have a positive impression of Obama and 38% seeing him unfavorably. But the warm ratings for Obama do not extend to his party. Favorability ratings for the Democratic Party dropped 6 points since October, and the 54% who hold an unfavorable opinion of it is the highest in CNN/ORC or CNN/USA Today/Gallup polling dating back to 1992.Among Democrats, favorability ratings for the party have dipped to 81%, down 10 points since late October. That's the lowest mark Democrats have given their own party in CNN polling in more than a decade. Just 28% of independents have a favorable take on the Democratic Party, an 11-point drop since October.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/barack-obama-approval-rating-democrats/index.html"}

{"_id":"Obamacare: What should stay, and what should go?","articleText":" (CNN)Calling it \"a fraud,\" \"horrible\" and \"a disaster,\" President-elect Donald Trump said that rolling back Obamacare and replacing it with a \"much less expensive\" alternative is top priority for his administration. But Americans are divided on what should happen next. One-third of all voters recently polled want the law expanded, one-third want it repealed, and only 9% want the administration to scale back what it offers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll from October.The law has always been polarizing. When the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act, as it is officially known, passed in 2010, it was considered the most dramatic overhaul of American health care in modern history.Studies show that it has made some people's lives better. It brought health coverage to 20 million more Americans, taking uninsured rates to an all-time low. It eliminated barriers to coverage and improved some hospitals, and fewer people with health emergencies went bankrupt.But -- and this is a big \"but\" -- there's a reason former President Clinton called Obamacare \"the craziest thing in the world\" before he walked that statement back. It has gotten more expensive -- too expensive for some. Plan and doctor choices are now more limited. And there's still a large part of the population that can't get affordable care because their states chose not to expand Medicaid. Even President Obama said he'd be open to fixes if Republicans make it \"cheaper and better.\"Trump said his repeal-and-replace plan will be a major early priority. Republicans, who have tried to repeal it more than 60 times, could take it up again in January. But some experts suggest that it could take up to two years to change the health care process. And even with a Republican president, it is highly unlikely (PDF) that Republicans will succeed in a total repeal. What could it be? Trump said he wants something that works better \"where your plan can actually be tailored\" and wouldn't merely be a plan to use only if \"you get hit by a truck.\" He has an eye on cost, too; Trump has consistently said that Obamacare is \"far too expensive\" for the insured and for the country. But Trump also told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that he wants to keep some of the more popular parts of the law.Considering what Trump has said about the plan in the past, what is possible in Congress and what the public seems to love and hate about the plan, here's a look at what part of Obamacare might make it into Trumpcare.What many people like about ObamacareCoverage for people with pre-existing conditionsA popular part of Obamacare is the elimination of insurance companies' ability to use health status, medical history and gender to determine whether you are eligible for coverage. Nor can insurance companies use your health status to decide what benefits you get or what premiums you're charged. Before the ACA, insurance companies could deny insurance to people if they had pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes or even pregnancy. These companies could also charge higher premiums and/or limit the benefits they'd offer to this population. One in two Americans has a pre-existing condition, according to an analysis from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Of those people, 25 million -- 46% --  were uninsured prior to the ACA.This part of the law became \"one of the strongest assets,\" Trump told \"60 Minutes,\" and he'd like to keep it.20-somethings on their parents' insuranceAnother popular part of Obamacare: Young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 26, even if they get married and even if they are not living with their parents. As the recession made it difficult for young people to find jobs with benefits, this was a popular part of the law when it passed. Since 20- to 24-year-olds have nearly double the unemployment rate of their older non-millennial family members, it remains popular to this day.Nearly 3 million previously uninsured young people got insurance under their parents' policies because of Obamacare.Trump told Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" that he will \"very much try and keep that.\" He added that it \"adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.\" No limits on annual or lifetime coverageThe ACA brought an end to lifetime limits on most plans. Prior to Obamacare, insurance companies could drop coverage when you were at your sickest. You could actually tap out your insurance resources, and the companies could set a dollar limit on what they'd spend on your care. Anyone who exceeded their limit was on the hook to pay for their care out of pocket. This part of the ACA was particularly popular with people who needed expensive drugs to fight rare diseases and those treated for cancers that required long hospital stays and lengthy chemotherapy. Many in those communities ended up facing medical bankruptcy, having to foot the bill for their own care. The ACA ended limits on marketplace plans and on most insurance plans people got through their jobs. No-cost preventive careObamacare allowed insured people to receive some health-care services at no cost. Basic services meant to keep you healthy like blood pressure checks, depression and HIV screenings, flu shots, breastfeeding supplies, mammograms and contraception, among other measures, were all covered.Contraceptives were the only item in the list that remained controversial, at least for some institutions with religious affiliations.Immediately after the election, Tweets and Facebook posts warned women that a Trump presidency could limit birth control coverage. Trump hasn't specifically mentioned what he'd like to do with preventative care overall. In September, though, he said he doesn't think you should need a prescription to buy birth control.    Improved hospital quality Incentives in the ACA started to move health care from a fee-for-service model to one that rewards quality of care.There's already evidence that Obamacare has improved care quality, studies show. There were real drops in hospital readmissions rates, and 50,000 fewer people died as a result of preventable errors and infections in hospitals from 2010 to 2013, according to White House data. But there are plenty of parts of the law Trump and others despise that will probably have to change.What many people hate about ObamacareThe costObamacare is too expensive for too many. In 2015, 46% of the uninsured adult population surveyed said they tried to get coverage but couldn't afford it, according to a recent Kaiser survey. The vast majority who get Obamacare, some 85%, get subsidies to make premiums relatively affordable. Those who don't qualify for subsidies feel the pain of the rise in premiums the most. Premiums skyrocketed an average of 22% for the benchmark plan in 2017. The spikes are felt unevenly, depending on location. In states where insurers pulled out of the marketplace, the prices went up significantly. In Oklahoma, for instance, the average premium price went up 69%. In Arizona, premiums more than doubled, and in Indiana, where there is more competition, the benchmark plan is 3% cheaper.The cost of deductibles went up too, meaning even people who do have coverage often won't go see a doctor.Trump said one way he'll bring down costs is to allow people to buy insurance across state lines. He argues that that encourages competition. \"It'll be great health care for much less money,\" Trump told \"60 Minutes.\" Required coverage and fewer choicesSome don't like being told by their government that they have to have insurance. Over half of Republicans polled by Kaiser said they'd like to repeal the requirement that nearly all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.People also complained about the kind of insurance available in marketplaces, especially as the number of insurers shrunk.To keep costs down, marketplace insurers narrowed their provider networks, meaning people have fewer doctor and hospital options. Constant plan changesThe shrinking pool of insurers means people often have to investigate new plans when they re-enroll. Filling out additional paperwork and researching options have been a constant source of frustration.In 2016, 43% of returning customers switched policies.  Small business burdensSome business groups have complained about the requirement that workplaces with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees must offer health care or face fines. The US Chamber of Commerce said that deters business growth.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/obamacare-repeal-love-hate/index.html"}
{"_id":"Officers injured, slain in what appear to be targeted shootings","articleText":" (CNN)Police are on high alert -- and in at least one city, mourning -- after four officers were shot Sunday in incidents around the country. Perhaps most startling to law enforcement is that in three of the shootings, it appears the alleged perpetrators specifically targeted police officers, according to authorities and local media reports.An officer in Sanibel, Florida, was shot in a drive-by as he conducted a traffic stop; a Gladstone, Missouri, officer was shot after a traffic stop that produced a foot chase and shootout; a 20-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department was wounded in what authorities characterize as an ambush; and San Antonio Police Detective Benjamin Marconi was killed outside police headquarters in what appears to be another ambush. In describing the circumstances leading to Marconi's death, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus cited recent ambush attacks on police in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In the former, sniper Micah Xavier Johnson in July killed five officers protecting activists demonstrating after the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Later that month, Iraq veteran Gavin Long ambushed three officers in Baton Rouge, fatally shooting them.Marconi's death marked the 58th fatal shooting of an officer this year -- well ahead of the number for all of 2015 (41) but not quite on pace to top the 2011 total of 73, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Police arrested the suspect in the San Antonio shooting Monday afternoon, while the St. Louis suspect was killed following an exchange of gunfire with police, authorities said. The suspect in Gladstone was killed as well, while the Sanibel suspect was taken into custody after a shootout at a golf-and-tennis community, local media outlets reported. Here's what we know about each incident. San AntonioMarconi, 50, pulled over a driver outside police headquarters just before noon Sunday and, after addressing the driver, returned to his patrol car to write a ticket. A man pulled up behind Marconi, exited his vehicle, approached Marconi's car and shot him in the head, McManus said. The suspect then shot Marconi again through the open window of the squad car, the police chief said.\"I believe the uniform was targeted,\" McManus said Monday at a news conference.Marconi, who had spent almost half of his life on the force, was killed, and the suspect drove away. Police arrested 31-year-old Otis Tyrone McKane around 4:30 p.m. Monday while he was riding with a woman and a 2-year-old child in a car on Interstate 10, Chief McManus said. \"This is the person whose image we saw on surveillance,\" McManus said at a press conference. \"This is also the person we believe is responsible for the cold and calculated murder of Detective Marconi.\"St. LouisInvestigators tracked down the suspect in the St. Louis police shooting as he was riding in a friend's car, which officers attempted to pull over, according to police. The alleged gunman darted from the car, firing once at police, before officers returned fire, killing the suspect early Monday, police said. A pistol with a high-capacity magazine was recovered from the scene. Authorities did not identify the suspect, but St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the man was implicated in multiple robberies, a carjacking and a potential homicide. It's likely, Dotson said, that the suspect fired at the police officer Sunday night out of fear of being recognized as a suspect in the string of crimes. Around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, the gunman pulled up to a marked police SUV and shot a 46-year-old officer twice in the head. \"This officer was not trying to pull this car over,\" Dotson said. \"This officer was driving down the road and was ambushed.\"The wounded officer's gun was in his holster during the shooting, and the veteran sergeant and married father of three told police he saw a muzzle flash to his left and felt the glass window shatter against him, Dotson said. The officer was in critical but stable condition, according to a late Sunday tweet from St. Louis police. SanibelJust before 8 p.m. Sunday, an officer was working a traffic stop when a man drove by and opened fire, according to a police statement. The suspect then drove to his home in The Dunes on Sanibel Island, a country club community, where he engaged police in a shootout before being taken into custody, police said. Several media outlets, including CNN affiliates WINK, WBBH, WZVN and WFTX, reported that the alleged gunman was wounded, likely in the back and shoulder, during the shootout. Resident Jeanne Vaughn told WINK she heard six gunshots during the search, which witnesses said included at least 20 police cars and a helicopter. \"I heard a police siren and then, (a) minute later I heard a bunch of shots. Bang, bang, you know, bang, bang, bang,\" Vaughn told the station. \"And then I heard more police sirens and I see police coming up and down the streets.\"According to WBBH, the officer, whose name CNN is working to confirm, was lauded as officer of year by the Lee County Bar Association. The officer earned the honor after using a defibrillator to save a woman's life, the station reported.He has been treated and released from a local hospital. Gladstone The Gladstone Police Department officer who was shot late Sunday underwent surgery and is expected to make a full recovery following rehab, the department tweeted. Because the officer was shot in the Kansas City suburb of Gladstone, police in Kansas City are fielding questions about the case. The incident began with a traffic violation and routine stop. That is, until a teenage suspect took off running and officers gave chase, said Kansas City Police Department spokeswoman Sgt. Kari Thompson.As officers attempted to take the teen into custody, a struggle ensued. The suspect brandished a handgun, shots were fired and the suspect was killed, Thompson said. The driver of the vehicle from which the teen fled was taken into custody, questioned and released. The injured officer remained at the hospital early Monday, the Gladstone Department of Public Safety tweeted. CNN's Mayra Cuevas, Max Blau and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Officials blast Trump vote fraud claims, GOP wants to 'move on' ","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Election officials, leading Democrats -- and even a prominent Republican -- blasted President-elect Donald Trump after he spread allegations of voter fraud and targeted a trio of states with his false claim.Trump first alleged Sunday that \"millions\" of undocumented immigrants voted against him and later directed the inaccurate charges at California, Virginia and New Hampshire. Neither Trump nor his transition team have responded to requests to explain what he meant or provide any evidence.\"Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\" Trump tweeted. Tom Rath, the former attorney general of New Hampshire and a longtime kingmaker in the state's Republican politics, knocked Trump Sunday evening.\"This will probably cost me my spot in the Cabinet but there was no fraud, serious or other, in this election in NH. There just wasn't,\" Rath tweeted.And California Secretary of State Alex Padilla hit back at Trump, tweeting that his \"unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd.\"Virginia Commissioner of Elections Edgardo Cortés said, \"The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded ... The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted.\"California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, tweeted: \"President-elect Trump's claim that he would have won popular vote but for fraud is as baseless as it is demeaning. #ActLikeAPresident\"And former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley said Trump should focus instead on restoring the Voting Rights Act and ending voter suppression.\"Hey @realDonaldTrump - The real issues with voter fraud are discriminatory Voter ID laws and illegal vote suppression tactics #RestoreTheVRA,\" O'Malley wrote.It was still unclear Monday why Trump was alleging voter fraud in the election he won, while Green Party officials were seeking a recount based on questions of whether voter fraud helped him win. Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign's former counsel, pointed out the irony of Trump blasting alleged voter fraud but opposing any investigation of the election results. \"We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud,\" Elias tweeted Sunday night. The first claim of massive vote fraud was apparently made by Gregg Phillips, of True the Vote, who tweeted a few days after the election that the number of \"non-citizen\" voters topped 3 million. His baseless allegation was later picked up by some fringe media outlets. Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican who will be one of Trump's key point men in Congress, said he did not know if there were \"millions\" of people who voted illegally, but said he would rather Trump and the Green Party both \"move on\" from the recount.\"He is the president-elect and it is time to move forward,\" Collins said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"It's time to move on. And it's time to end the discussion of recounts and, again, hopefully we can strengthen voter ID laws.\"Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, also said there may be evidence of some voter fraud, but nothing close to the \"millions\" of voters Trump is claiming.\"I have not seen anything in the millions, I don't know what he was talking about,\" Lankford told CNN's Alisyn Camerota.

But it was the peculiar diet she began after World War I that Morano says helped her become one of the oldest people ever.When she was a teenager, a doctor suggested that Morano eat raw eggs to combat her anemia. She followed a stringent diet of two raw eggs, one cooked egg, a little minced meat and pasta for the past 90 years. With age, her diet has been cut down to just two eggs a day and some cookies.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/health/oldest-living-person-emma-morano/index.html"}
{"_id":"Olympic medalist swimmer takes on depression with help of Phelps, others","articleText":" (CNN)Imagine that swimming is what you've loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in Allison Schmitt's mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. It hasn't always been that way. To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn't see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun. \"It's what keeps me going,\" she said.In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. \"Laugh it off\" is her go-to coping mechanism. Jack Bauerle, Schmitt's coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. \"Sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,\" Bauerle said.Road to the OlympicsA swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As \"the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,\" Schmitt was a soccer player but didn't end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool. In fact, Schmitt didn't quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life. Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn't miss classes. It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn't be qualified because she was the \"slow kid.\" She didn't feel like she belonged on the team and even had a \"breakdown\" during the training camp.Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence. Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game. Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.The shadows of depressionThe London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt's swimming career. After that, depression crept in. She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, \"This is the worst day ever.\"She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn't feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment. Schmitt didn't want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate. \"Allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,\" said Bob Bowman, Schmitt's coach since 2006. \"She just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.\" He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games. Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. \"The spirit wasn't there,\" said Bauerle, Schmitt's Georgia swimming coach. \"You could just see the difference sometimes.\" Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, \"post-Olympic blues.\" But for Schmitt, this \"phase\" lasted a little too long.She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn't fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother. In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, \"oh, my gosh, I can't do this anymore.\" She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.Seeing Phelps go through his own mental health struggles, Schmitt thought, if he said she would be able to push through, she could do the same. So she took his advice to seek help and started to see a psychologist that January. \"I started accepted the fact that I wanted to get help,\" said Schmitt. \"It's OK to feel that way.\"Bringing the darkness of depression to lightAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. In 2014, it is estimated that at least 6.7% of US adults had at least one depressive episode. Scott Goldman, a sports psychologist at the University of Michigan, said it is normal for some athletes to experience a sense of loss after the Olympics. \"You give everything you have to something. When that something ends, it's significant,\" he said. \"For a lot of them, this is a roller coaster of excitement. ... It's a difficult transition from 'I am a swimmer' to 'I was a swimmer.' \"To some, post-Olympic blues can be just as hard to cope with as the death of a loved one or the end of a relationship, said Goldman.For a while, Schmitt wasn't open about her psychological suffering. She thought that seeing a psychologist was an embarrassment and kept it from her family. It wasn't until her cousin, a young athlete named April Bocian, ended her own life in May 2015 that Schmitt decided to speak out.\"Especially as athletes, we are taught that if we push through something, we can get through. We use that mentality in sports, and we use that in life,\" said Schmitt. \"But life is such a big game. You need a whole army of support and help that you can get.\"By being outspoken about her own struggles, she hopes she'll inspire more people to recognize the severity of depression and the importance of seeking help. Now, Schmitt has become more comfortable sharing her thoughts and emotions with the psychologist. She goes to her office whenever she needs someone to talk to. She's also considering pursuing a master's degree in social work to counsel those who are struggling with mental health problems. The changes are obvious. Bowman and Bauerle said they saw a much happier and more positive Schmitt during the Rio Games, where she took home a gold medal and a silver. Bauerle thinks Schmitt opening up about depression would be helpful to those who are going through similar struggles, especially athletes and their coaches. \"Going back in time, I wish I had a better hold on her,\" said Bauerle. \"She's giving service for coaches, to make sure that they are more aware. ... I think everybody's radar will be a little better for athletes.\"Goldman, the sports psychologist, suggested that people close to athletes recognize post-performance phases as a natural part of the process, be mindful of the warning signs, and offer true and honest support. Unlike physical injuries, which can be seen in bandages, athletes' psychological struggles could often go unnoticed. Goldman said that depending on the kind of sports, \"they might move at a slower pace; they might have trouble getting out of bed; they might have trouble getting engaged in tasks they did well before.\"Focusing more on the Olympians themselves and recognizing them as human beings, instead of their experience with the Olympic Games, is key to building authentic relationships and offering help, said Goldman.

{"_id":"On the Thanksgiving table: Trump, US jobs and Mexico","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The Carrier Corp. in Indiana said Thursday that it's had talks with the incoming administration hours after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted he is working to keep the furnace-making plant from shipping jobs to Mexico.\"I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\" Trump tweeted. Carrier, a subsidiary of UTC, tweeted in response: \"Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time.\"The company has previously been adamant that it will not keep the 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. As recently as two weeks ago, the company told The New York Times it was still moving operations, \"We are making every effort to ease the transition for our Carrier colleagues in Indiana.\" Its decision was based largely because of the $65 million that executives say they will save by moving to Monterey, Mexico - despite political broadsides from Trump, former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and many others.The plant, on the west side of Indianapolis, quickly became a flashpoint in the campaign earlier this year after a video of a Carrier executive telling the workers they were shuttering the plant went viral. In the months after that, the Carrier plant became shorthand for the loss of jobs and impact of trade that many were hit by throughout the Rust Belt.Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers local 1999, which represents the Carrier workers being laid off, said Thursday that he has not heard from Trump or the incoming administration, but that he will support anyone who can save their jobs. \"I hope that he's able to save the plant in Indianapolis,\" Jones said. \"He still thinks we make air conditioners there. Here in Indy we make furnaces. If he can save these people's jobs, regardless of what he thinks we make, that's great.\"The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/politics/trump-carrier-plant-indianapolis/index.html"}

The frigid cold, along with the lack of daylight and mountains of snow, can be deadly for someone who is homeless. Samuel Johns knows all too well the dangers these individuals face. He has seen them with his own eyes.So he decided to do something about it.\"I started ForgetMeNotAK.org, a Facebook group page, to help the homeless reconnect with their families,\" says Johns.Within six months after he started the movement, the Facebook page reached over 16,500 members. Johns says it is a community built on people who want to do good things for those in need.How it worksIf the homeless person agrees, his or her photo is posted on the Forget Me Not Facebook page, along with the person's name and other information. If someone recognizes the person, the group will provide as much information as possible to help the homeless person get back home.  The group gives people who want to fight homelessness a way to do so in cyberspace. It also provides clothes and other resources to the homeless.\"We've already gotten people off of the street, but I can't bring everybody home. I can meet them and encourage them and let them know that they are loved,\" Johns said. \"I don't want to look at them in a bad way, you know. Instead of stereotyping them, I want to see what their stories are and treat them like human beings.\"  Music brings people togetherAlthough Johns has never been homeless, he has had his share of personal struggles. He's a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for eight years. \"I found my outlet through music. That's what really helped me sober up,\" John says. Currently, he's trying to make it as an artist who blends hip-hop with his Athabascan (Native Alaskan) culture.  He believes everyone can relate to music, and that's what he brings when volunteering at Bean's Cafe, a nonprofit organization that has been serving meals to the homeless in Anchorage since 1979.Johns serves up drumming and singing in his native language at Bean's and invites others to dance and sing along.\"It brings people back to their roots, to when they were young.

{"_id":"Outdoor adventure empowers young cancer patients","articleText":"\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute\" airs live on CNN and CNNgo Sunday, December 11 at 8 p.m. ETTarkio, Montana (CNN)In kayaking, a \"first descent\" is when someone successfully paddles a section of river that no one has ever paddled before.By the time Brad Ludden was 18 years old, he had attained close to 100 of them.\"Every time you come around a corner, you're the first person to see it from that perspective,\" said Ludden, now 35. \"You feel a lot of personal transformation and growth through that process.\"Today, Ludden is giving that life-changing experience to young adults with cancer—helping them face down their fears and realize they're not alone.\"When you're a young person with cancer, it's so isolating,\" said Ludden, who watched his own aunt battle cancer when she was 38. \"All your friends are getting married, having children, starting jobs and living life. Here you are fighting for yours.\" Every year, more than 70,000 young adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease.Ludden's nonprofit—First Descents—offers free outdoor adventures based around kayaking, surfing and rock climbing. The weeklong camps are held at picturesque locations, where 15 young adult cancer fighters and survivors from across the country come together to challenge themselves physically and bond with others who've gone through the same battle. \"While thousands of people have kayaked these sections of river before them, it's their first time down,\" Ludden said. \"You see it at the bottom of the rapids in the look of accomplishment and pride on their faces.\"Since 2001, Ludden and his group have brought these transformative experiences to more than 3,000 people. \"I have learned more from First Descents' participants than anything else in my entire life,\" Ludden said. \"I've learned how to be much more vulnerable, the importance of laughter and to not just accept each day as it comes but to go out and define it.\"CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Ludden about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: During the week, you see a transformation in the participants. What's that like? Ludden: Day one, they get all their gear and they learn the very basics of whatever it is they're there to do. And then each day, we ratchet that up a little bit and build on the previous day so that by the end of the week, they're applying everything they've learned to one final challenging day. And that could be a multi-pitch ascent, or a bigger break, or harder whitewater. It's fascinating to watch not only the physical transformation, but also the social and emotional transformation. The way they bond together and the confidence that they're building—it's a really beautiful transformation to witness in a relatively short amount of time.CNN: Each participant gets a nickname. Why?Ludden: (It) is a huge part of our culture. This experience can be a real stake in the sand in their recovery or their life post-diagnosis. It can be one of their greatest victories and a really defining experience. This name becomes associated with that experience. It's the name of them as a kayaker, or a climber, or a surfer. It's not the name of them as someone with cancer. And so it's an opportunity for a fresh start. We've found a lot of people take a lot of pride in their name.CNN: First Descents goes beyond a weeklong program. How do participants continue their journey?Ludden: The weeklong trip hopefully is the beginning of their First Descents experience. When they go home from that, we've created local adventure communities around the country that they can engage in, go on more localized adventures. We host (additional) one- to two-weeklong programs. Those are much more adventure-oriented and are all over the world—everywhere from Africa to Indonesia and Alaska to Patagonia. We believe that this shouldn't be a one-and-done experience. As part of that, we truly see healing in the act of helping someone else. And we believe that we all as a community who are experiencing these programs have the same obligation to help other people have the same experience. So we try to create this pay-it-forward aspect. We create fundraising challenges around the country that everyone's invited to be a part of, all with the goal of providing that first-time experience to someone who hasn't had it, but wants it.CNN: What do you hope participants gain from each week? Ludden: I hope that they come here seeking some answers, perhaps seeking some personal growth and maybe some victory over their cancer. We infuse a lot of challenge and adventure, beautiful settings, laughter, great people and good food. But I think at the end, all that bundled together just represents a very large transformation in everyone's life.  It's that important reminder that this life, it's really fleeting. The end is going to come sooner than we want. With that knowledge, we have this obligation to go out and live as fully as possible.Want to get involved?

{"_id":"Outsmart the food companies to become a healthier, savvier eater  ","articleText":" (CNN)Like many people, I crave something sweet after every meal, no matter how full I am, to the point where it feels like an addiction. A colleague told me it wasn't an addiction, but a habit. Still, the thought lingered: Do we experience true food cravings, perhaps as a result of an \"addiction,\" or is it simply out of habit? And who's driving that habit -- me or the food companies? It's actually both: It's human nature for consumers to develop habits and seek out foods that satisfy our intense cravings. And so companies create products that meet people's sensory needs.  \"Food companies are interested in selling products that people want,\" said Gail Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products. \"They run tests with consumers and ask them, 'How much do you like this one? Or that one?' The companies are trying to figure out what consumers want, and then they do testing to make sure the product has those elements in it -- and people like salt, fat and sugar.\" It's no surprise that food companies would aim to give consumers what they want in an effort to optimize sales. But the process behind product development is quite sophisticated. For companies, the key is finding a food's \"bliss point.\"Discovering the 'bliss point'The key for companies is finding the \"bliss point\" of a food, or the product formulation you like most, according to Howard Moskowitz, an experimental psychologist who did pioneering work on bliss points and their role in product development when he was optimizing menus for soldiers in 1971. He's since helped major food and beverage companies such as Dr Pepper and Prego find bliss points for their products. He offered this example: \"Let's just look at coffee with milk. Make some coffee, and pour it into seven cups. Start with no milk, and add a certain amount,\" such as you'd find in the tiny plastic containers at a diner. \"Do this so you have zero, one, two, three, four, five and six added containers. The one at the left has no milk; the ones to the right have six different but increasing levels of milk. One of these is the 'tastiest' for you.\" This is your bliss point.  How does bliss point play out behind the scenes, when it comes to product design and development? For new products, like pickles or pasta sauce, the company may systematically vary the ingredients and test these variations. It's not just one ingredient alone, but a set of them. Some ingredients appear at different levels. Others appear in different types (such as flavoring A or flavoring B).  \"The careful product developer makes the combinations, tests them and builds a mathematical model showing how the ingredients interact to drive liking,\" Moskowitz said.  \"The bliss point -- that's at the top. Sometimes, there are different bliss points, or 'optima,' say for people who like strong 'dark roast (coffee) brews' and those who like the regular or weaker 'lighter brews.' \"Bliss points have been discovered for many foods -- even hummus and orange juice -- in order to appeal to consumers' sensory preferences. And this can help explain why, over time, foods evolve to have more sweetness.  \"Each generation of food marketers wants to increase acceptance, and the easiest way to do this for many foods is to add sugar,\" Moskowitz said. But it's a slippery slope. \"You add just a little bit each time, so over the course of a decade, there's a bigger change.\"  Thus, foods like condiments, tomato sauce and bread -- foods that we might not necessarily think of as sweet -- often contain added sugars.Tomato sauce can have 12 grams, about 3 teaspoons, of sugar per half-cup. That's more than you would find in a chocolate mini doughnut.  Barbecue sauce can have 16 grams of sugar -- or 4 teaspoons in a 2-tablespoon serving -- more sugar than the amount in four chocolate chip cookies or eight sugar wafers. It's no wonder our palates have evolved to the point where we don't necessarily know what natural sweetness is anymore: Our taste buds have been, to some degree, externally manipulated over the years.Heading off food burnoutAlthough bliss point may be used to find how much pulp an orange juice should contain or the optimal amount of fat for the tastiest ice cream, it has other applications, too. Bliss point has also been used to figure out at which point during a consumption period a person is most sated. But the two applications don't necessarily work together, because the same sensory characteristics that make your taste buds most excited can run the risk of burnout with each additional bite.The concept, known as sensory specific satiety, refers to a temporary decline in pleasure derived from consuming a certain food. The result, according to a study in the journal Appetite, is a decrease in a person's liking and desire for a specific food after eating it.\"The more powerful your experience with the first couple of bites, the less satisfying each additional bite is,\" said Brian Wansink, director of Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab and author of \"Slim by Design.\"  The result: You get bored of eating relatively quickly. \"When you eat salted caramel ice cream, the first two bites are incredible.  But then there's a big jump by the time you get to bites six and seven. ... By then, you may be saying, 'Eh, this wasn't as good as it was initially.' \"  Interestingly, sensory specific satiety can be thought of as a human protection element -- and a way the body adapts in order to avoid sensory overload, according to Civille, of Sensory Spectrum. Imagine stepping slowly and carefully into a very hot bathtub. \"At first, you feel HOT, HOT, HOT!  But then your body adapts to the hot temperature in order to protect itself from having too much stimulation, as the brain cannot process all of the messages at once,\" Civille said. \"In the case of food, adaptation results in fullness.\" Despite this scientific reality, the notion of sensory specific satiety doesn't stop companies from prioritizing taste experience, with the hope that you won't be able to stop after just one bite. \"Companies are developing products for that initial 'Oh, my goodness!' with the first couple of bites,\" Wansink said.  And even if the level of sensory satisfaction drops, if you start high enough, it won't necessarily matter.  \"The seventh and eighth bite of the salted caramel ice cream will still be pretty good,\" he said. \"You're still far ahead of the grapefruit.\"  In order to extend the amount of time it will take before you get bored of eating a food, its maker may include ingredient variety -- for example, making a raisin bran with yogurt puffs or oatmeal clusters.  Wansink explains how: \"If you mix popcorn with M&Ms, you can eat a lot more than you would if you ate either food alone, because the M&Ms counter the salty flavor of the popcorn, and the buttery popcorn counters the sweetness of the M&Ms.\"Civille agrees. \"Without texture and flavor variety, you become full or burnt out.  Any new input is not interesting.\" This phenomenon helps explain why kids -- and adults -- can say \"I'm so full\" after a meal but still have room for dessert. \"Dessert is sweet and interesting.\"  No wonder I need my sugar fix, even when I'm stuffed from a larger-than-usual meal.  Perhaps I'm not truly addicted to sugar, but rather, my body has succumbed to the science of sensory specific satiety.  Becoming an empowered eaterThe psychology that goes into finding a \"bliss point\" and coping with sensory specific satiety is significantly helpful for companies' bottom lines, but the practical takeaway can have implications for consumers' health, particularly when foods and beverages are consumed in excess.  Changing kids' palates -- which already prefer sweet tastes -- toward sweetness can lead to weight gain, obesity and other health problems.  In a world of such abundance, how can consumers become more educated and make the right choices?  Here are some tips and tricks to help become savvier, healthier eaters:1.  Find a food mantra. \"What if we could find the messages to repeat to ourselves, almost like self-advertising, to get us to eat healthily?\" asked Moskowitz. In fact, that's what the bliss point pioneer is working on now: messages that work for consumers. \"The science is of words, but it's still looking for the bliss point. But now the bliss point is the combination of messages that a person will find compelling.\" You might ask yourself, \"Am I really hungry? Do I really want this food? Or am I bored or stressed?\" External motivation works too, he says. \"Many people will remind themselves of goals, like, 'I want to look good in a dress for my daughter's wedding.' \"2.  Have a decent breakfast. It will help you avoid cravings, especially sugar cravings. \"If your blood sugar is low (from skipping breakfast), you're going to start eating anything and everything,\" Civille said. But a bagel with nothing on it? You'll be hungry again by 10:30. \"The key is to manipulate your own body's cravings by giving it the right kinds of foods to start with,\" she said. And different foods may work better for different people. \"If I eat a bowl of oatmeal at 6:30, I'm not hungry until lunch.\"3. Wean your palate. You can change your palate to crave less sweet, salty, fatty foods. \"Once people learn to like skim milk, whole milk is too much for them,\" Wansink said. One of the ways you can make it happen, he says, is to make sure you pair the product that contains less sugar, salt, fat, whatever -- with something that you do like. \"Let's say you drink way too much Coke. You tell yourself you're going to drink Diet Coke instead, but you hate the taste of diet soda. So you pair it with something you do enjoy, like taking a walk.\" By doing this, he says, you don't experience the switch to diet soda as such a sacrifice, and eventually you will like it more. Or try making the switch from a sugary cereal to a more protein-rich breakfast.  Something as simple as pairing cheese or ketchup with eggs can make a protein-rich breakfast more appealing, and eventually, you won't even crave the sugar. 4.  Add fat.  \"You should have some fat in your diet, because fat is interesting and satiating. It holds flavor and releases the flavor in a different way than a water-based system,\" Civille said. Consider the difference between a teaspoon of vanilla extract in heavy cream (that's so good!) versus skim milk (awful). The satiety and satisfaction that the fat offers will ultimately allow you to eat less. Spread peanut butter on apple slices or top a mixed green salad with a vinaigrette dressing.5.  Choose portion-controlled snacks. Here's a case where package design (think 100-calorie packs) may be more costly, but they help you eat less, because they slow the pace of eating. \"Having to open up three 100-calorie packs to get 300 calories of chocolate takes a longer time to eat and makes you less sated than if all 300 chocolate calories were in front of you,\" Wansink said. The result: People usually give up -- and consume fewer calories overall. To save money, buy snacks in bulk and make your own portion-controlled snacks at home using small plastic bags.   6.  Drink a glass of water. \"Having a glass of water with you all the time is one way of dealing with sensory specific satiety,\" Civille said.  \"The sense of fullness reduces hunger and keeps us hydrated. Often, we eat when we, in fact, are thirsty or dehydrated.\"   7.  Choose cheese over chips at a party.  \"People immediately go to the bowl of chips, but you should be looking for the more protein-rich appetizer, which will give you more satiety,\" Civille said. A cube of cheese, shrimp or even a slider is a good choice.8.  Don't go food shopping on an empty stomach. \"When you go to the supermarket hungry, you buy things that you crave ... and those are typically not good choices, like ice cream, doughnuts and cookies, as opposed to buying more vegetables,\" Civille said.  Wasnick agrees. \"You buy more of the ready-to-eat convenience food, the stuff you can eat in the parking lot,\" he said.  Here's food for thought:  Simply eating a piece of fruit 30 minutes before going into a grocery store can significantly change your purchasing habits for the better. \"Even just a piece of an apple before you leave -- or even a sample of one -- dramatically increases how much fruit you buy and decreases the amount of junk food,\" Wansink said.9.  Divide your cart in half.  \"An easy thing that we've discovered is the half-cart rule,\" Wansink said.  \"Divide your cart in half with a coat, purse or briefcase.  The front half of the cart is reserved for fruits and vegetables.   The back half of the cart is for whatever else I want.  Simply doing this increases the amount of fruit and vegetables people buy by 25%-30%.\"10.  Distract yourself. \"There's a really neat study we did: We had people only eat a quarter as much of a snack as they usually eat in the afternoon,\" Wansink said. \"So let's say you usually eat eight Hershey's Kisses, and we gave you two. We found that 15 minutes later, people rated themselves as equally full, satisfied and happy -- and less guilty!\"  But here's the important part: \"After they had their first two bites, they had to put the food away -- they couldn't stare at it -- and they had to do something (active) for those 15 minutes to distract themselves, like cleaning the office or returning phone calls. They could not sit at the computer.\"  The results were encouraging. \"All they could remember is that they still tasted that chocolate, apple pie or potato chips -- and they realized they didn't deny themselves anything.\" But getting their minds off of the food was key. \"They realized they can have what they enjoy -- as long as they can distract themselves enough to not think about it.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/health/bliss-point-food/index.html"}
{"_id":"Painting allows blind artist to see a world of color","articleText":" (CNN)John Bramblitt believes he could draw before he could walk. Drawing and illustrating just clicked with him from the beginning, but he also loved telling stories with words. He would share his written stories with his family and friends, but the art remained personal. Art was also his way of coping with spending much of his childhood in the hospital. After experiencing his first seizure at age 2, Bramblitt was diagnosed with severe epilepsy. By the time he was 7, he'd had surgery to remove his left kidney. Doctors believed that renal failure was causing his seizures, but he continued to have seizures. To cope, he turned to drawing. \"Art was a great way to deal with a bad day and celebrate a good day,\" said Bramblitt, now 41. At age 11, Bramblitt suffered a troubling number of seizures, more than ever. After nearly four years, he was diagnosed with Lyme disease. He began a new treatment for epilepsy in an effort to control his seizures at the same time he began treatment for Lyme disease. It caused the seizures to increase in magnitude. During each, his heart and breathing would stop, causing irreparable damage. He experienced some hearing loss, and after each seizure, his vision would remain blurry for a while, but then it would clear up, he said. What neither he nor his doctors realized was that his vision was decreasing each time. The cascading temporal lobe seizures, which begin in the front of the brain and cascade toward the back, had the same effect as a hit to the back of the head over and over. His occipital lobe, known as the visual processing center of the brain, suffered from these severe, repeated attacks. This process unfolded from his adolescence into college, where he majored in English with the hopes of becoming a creative writing teacher. Worried that he would be perceived differently than the other students, Bramblitt didn't tell his professors about his epilepsy or the seizures. Although he was a good student, he would often miss class because of his seizures and the issues that followed. Feeling that school wasn't for him, he dropped out of college for several years to work on computers. But after a time, Bramblitt realized he had taken the wrong path and went back to school. Descending into darknessBramblitt thought that if he could control the seizures, his vision would return to normal. But in his mid-20s, while attending college for the second time at the University of North Texas in 2001, he received the news that he would lose the rest of his vision. There was nothing doctors could do to stop it. \"I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach,\" he said. \"And then I thought my life was over. It wasn't 'oh, poor me,' it was doing the math in my head. I thought, 'I'm an epileptic; now I'm blind. If I try as hard as I can, maybe I won't be a burden to my family.' \"His eye doctor reassured him that with technology and orientation and mobility training, he would be able to travel, work any job and do anything else he wanted with his life. Bramblitt thought it was a nice lie. He was completely blind by the time fall semester began. He worked with the disability office on campus to arrange for a guide who could help direct him to his classes. He threw himself into learning Braille, how to cook without burning himself and how to navigate campus in new ways. Although he was encouraged by each new thing he accomplished, Bramblitt was equally frustrated by what he couldn't do. He was slow at reading Braille, and the software he used to write papers for class had a stark, technical voice that threw him off. But most of all, he still felt like a burden to his supportive family and friends. \"Deep down, I was so depressed and angry,\" he said. \"Even though I was around people I had known all my life, they didn't understand how I related to the world anymore. They weren't sure how to relate to me anymore, and I didn't know how to relate to myself. It's an isolating and scary thing. I went to school with ideas and dreams and shifted my sole focus to not being a burden, which was just a depressing place to live.\"Bramblitt began to gain confidence when he was able to go from using a guide to guiding himself across campus with the aid of a seeing-eye dog and a cane. But when he was alone, he felt like he was losing his mind. That's when he remembered the joy he used to gain from creating art. He began by trying to draw simple shapes, but would feel his pencil run off the paper. Bramblitt realized he needed to create a structure to follow. Fabric paint, which would create raised lines as it dried, became his new pencil, and he used oil paints to bring the paintings to life. Using a cane to touch the ground and his hands to learn his new way through the world had transformed Bramblitt's photographic-like memory into more of a \"touch to sight\" memory. He could touch different parts of something, connect them in his mind and be able to \"see\" what he was touching in his mind, a technique known as haptic visualization. He used this to \"see\" what he wanted to paint and to distinguish between oil paints, because each color had a different viscosity and texture. Encouraged by the way it made him feel, he would paint for hours every day.  Going blind changed Bramblitt's perception of art, but he's convinced that it's for the better. \"When I was sighted, if the drawing looked like the person, I would think it was good,\" he said. \"I still want them to look like themselves, but I became so interested in perception and trying to go beyond the skin and bones of someone and get down to what is the essence of that person and what makes them who they are. And that's what I try to do with color, by putting that emotion and feeling in and capturing what they were like in that moment. It's forced me to be more present.\"Finding the lightFor months, art was his secret outlet, and for the first time since going blind, Bramblitt began to feel hopeful again. It was his white seeing-eye dog, Ann, who let his friends in on the secret: They began noticing little patches of purple, blue or green on her fur. Bramblitt had feared judgment, being a blind man teaching himself to paint, but his friends were excited to see how happy it made him.\"Art is this wonderful thing that forces you to focus on the creative and what you can do,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what you can't do. You have an idea, and you figure out ways how to make that idea come true. You get in this habit of thinking in a positive and creative way. When I'm painting, I'm only thinking about the end of that brush, and it puts me in that moment. It's a much calmer, happier place to be.\"Bramblitt began showing his art at a local art cafe as well as a gallery at the university. At first, he would stand off to the side and didn't tell anyone he was blind. Soon, he realized that he didn't have to hide it, and he was able to open up and talk about what the pieces meant to him. Although Bramblitt is an artist full-time now, he hasn't turned his back on writing. He wrote a book about his journey called \"Shouting in the Dark.\" Over the years, Bramblitt has connected with charities and started a series of workshops for artists with and without sight, young and old. He believes art should be something everyone can connect with and works with museums to make them more accessible for all. After all, art changed his life. A few years after losing his sight, a friend invited Bramblitt to meet a girl at a wrap party, where the university's student newspaper staff celebrated the last paper of the semester. Instead, he ended up meeting the host, who studied journalism but had also received a degree in art. \"Jacqi was just the sweetest, nicest and funniest person,\" Bramblitt recalled. \"She was brilliant, and I immediately wanted to be friends with her. We hung out and talked that night, and we've been hanging out ever since.\" Next year, the couple will have been married for 10 years. They live in Denton, Texas, and have an 8-year-old son, Jack. And thanks to treatment, Bramblitt's epilepsy is manageable.His family has changed Bramblitt's life. \"I thought I understood what color was until my son was born,\" he said. \"I was able to feel my son's face the moment after he was born and see what he looked like. Without these touch techniques from painting, I wouldn't have been able to do that. And whenever I did that, the colors in my mind would just explode, and all of my paintings got so much brighter after that. If you would have told me 15 years ago that I would have so much love and color in my life, I would have thought you were crazy. I'm still blind and still epileptic, but I'm happier than I've ever been in my life.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/turning-points-blind-artist-john-bramblitt/index.html"}

{"_id":"Panera Bread's menu, as curated by a nutritionist","articleText":" (CNN)From a nutritional standpoint, there's much to love about Panera Bread's offerings. In fact, when it comes to healthy meals to grab on the go, we think that Panera trumps all other fast food fare.Whether you wish to select portion-controlled items from their \"You Pick Two\" menu or you appreciate the chain's commitment to clean ingredients (all meals will be free of artificial preservatives, sweeteners, colors and flavors by the end of 2016, the company claims), you really can't go too far astray at this health-conscious eatery.But one cautionary note about beverages: Unless you're burning lots of energy and can afford some extra carbs (perhaps training for a half-marathon), it's best to pair your meals with water, tea or other unsweetened drinks, as many beverages at fast food chains contain well over a day's worth of added sugars.Here are the best Panera Bread options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu (which can change, even seasonally, and sometimes titles of dishes). We break it down by good choices for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kidsOur picks: Kids' all-natural turkey chili with kids' classic salad and squeezable yogurtOne of the healthiest options on Panera's kids menu is the kids' all-natural turkey chili, which contains 8 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein, available in cooler seasons. Pair it with a salad to encourage some brave green bites, and don't forget about the squeezable yogurt, a fun treat that adds a calcium boost to the meal.Other good options for kids include the low-fat vegetarian black bean soup and the low-fat all-natural chicken noodle soup. The sandwiches are higher in saturated fat, and all include nutritionally inferior white bread. And while the kids' mac & cheese with white cheddar is delish, save it for the weekend splurge, as it contributes a generous amount of cholesterol-raising saturated fat. For vegetariansOur pick: Tomato mozzarella flatbread and classic saladIf cheese is your protein go-to on a vegetarian diet, then Panera's tomato mozzarella flatbread should be at the top of your list. This flatbread satisfies with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and basil pesto sauce, and it has only 460 milligrams of sodium. Add the seasonal salad to boost the protein and double the fiber content of the meal.Note: The seasonal lentil quinoa bowl offers a hearty combination of protein-rich ingredients, including a nutrient-rich egg (if you haven't heard, eggs -- including the yolk -- get the green light these days). The only downside of the lentil bowl: It will give you half of your sodium quota for the day.For vegansOur picks: Modern Greek salad with quinoa but without fetaIt can be challenging to find nutrient-rich vegan options that please the palate, but this salad offers a tasty combo of kale, romaine, kalamata olives and heart-healthy almonds -- all tossed with Greek dressing.If you're craving variety, you could get a half portion of the salad with a cup of the low-fat vegetarian garden vegetable soup, without pesto, or black bean soup as part of the \"You Pick Two\" menu, but it would drive sodium levels up for the meal.For calorie-countersOur picks: Seasonal salad with chicken (half) and low-fat vegetarian garden vegetable soup with pesto (1 cup)Sometimes we wonder if the \"P\" in Panera stands for portion control. The \"You Pick Two\" menu is a dieter's delight, as it controls calories without you having to think. The specific combination of non-creamy soup and salad, both high-volume foods, goes a long way toward keeping you full on fewer calories, according to research. Note: if you can afford a few more calories, go for the low-fat vegetarian black bean soup, which will add even more protein and fiber to the meal, keeping you satiated long after you've had your last bites.For the sugar-sensitiveOur picks: Roasted turkey and avocado BLT on sourdough (half) and Caesar salad (half)It might sound strange recommending the roasted turkey and avocado BLT over the roasted turkey and caramelized kale panini; after all, \"superfood\" kale is typically considered healthier than sodium-laden bacon. The turkey sandwich has slightly less saturated fat and sodium, and a bit more protein, but the  entire meal has only 2 grams of sugar. That's just half a teaspoon's worth.  For the salt-sensitiveOur picks: Classic salad with chicken and an appleAt 320 milligrams for the whole salad, the classic salad with chicken is one of the lowest-sodium items on Panera's entire menu. Adding an apple gives a potassium boost, which helps to lessen sodium's effects on blood pressure.Since it's rare to find tomato foods that are lower in sodium, the tomato mozzarella flatbread, which has 460 milligrams of sodium, is also worth mentioning.For the gluten-sensitiveOur picks: Fuji apple chicken saladWith all of Panera's fresh-baked bread, it can't guarantee that its menu items have not touched gluten. So while its gluten-conscious menu items are made without gluten-containing ingredients, if you have celiac disease, heightened gluten sensitivity or a wheat allergy, your best bet may be to avoid the chain.That being said, Panera offers plenty of options if you're simply looking to avoid or cut back on gluten. On its list of gluten-free fare is the tasty Fuji apple chicken salad. With its crunchy apple chips, Gorgonzola cheese and pecans, it's one of our favorites on Panera's entire menu. For the athleteOur picks: Steak and arugula sandwich (half) and a superfruit power smoothieWith a healthy combination of performance-boosting nutrients including iron, protein and carbs, we can't think of a better pre- or post-workout meal combination than this sandwich and smoothie. (If your appetite won't be satisfied with a half sandwich, go for the whole one.) The Greek yogurt in the smoothie provides electrolytes that are lost in sweat, including calcium, potassium and magnesium, and boosts the protein content of the meal, which is key for muscle rebuilding post-workout.For the road warriorOur picks: Tuna salad sandwich on honey wheat with apple and baked crispsThis no-fuss tuna sandwich is satisfying and easy to eat on the road. Don't forget the apple and chips, especially on long trips.For the carb-consciousOur pick: Romaine and kale Caesar salad with chicken (half)With only 5 grams of carbs and 21 grams of protein, this power salad is sure to satisfy all of the carb counters we know. We especially love the Parmesan crisps, which are a tasty substitute for carb-rich croutons. (The crisps also contribute a generous dose of calcium to the salad). Just keep saturated fat in check during the rest of the day, as it runs on the higher side.For the breakfast loverOur pick: Power almond quinoa oatmealWe know breakfast menus can be tricky to navigate at fast food restaurants; after all, some of the most nutrient-rich morning meals often come with a heaping dose of sodium or sugar. That's why we had to mention the power almond quinoa oatmeal. Not only does it contain a tasty mix of toasted almonds, cinnamon and honey, the combination of protein and carbs that the bowl packs is sure to keep you alert and energized throughout your morning.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/05/health/panera-bread-menu-nutritionist/index.html"}
{"_id":"Parent Acts: How to deal with a defiant child ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)Just about every day, Angela Estes, a New York mom, finds herself asking her 5-year-old son, \"Why are you being so defiant?\"When she says it's time to get dressed and head to school or when she gives the sign that playground time has come to an end, he has other ideas, said a frustrated Estes.\"He just wants to do what he wants to do, and I find it very hard to establish the authority that whether he wants to do it or not, it's what we're going to do,\" she said.Who can't relate to that? I remember a few months back when one of my daughters wouldn't listen to me. I resorted to the old \"Go to your room,\" which didn't work, either. She continued to remain defiant and disobey me until I checked out of the situation and ignored her.Still, I wondered what the \"right\" way to handle her behavior actually was. Estes struggles with the same question and has even tried giving her son choices, such as saying that either they leave the playground or he is \"choosing\" not to have any screen time at home.\"I sort of end up running out of things to take away, and then I get frustrated and angry, and I don't know what to do when I've run out of things and he still doesn't want to do it,\" she said.In the eighth installment of our CNN Digital Video series \"Parent Acts,\" we asked parents to act out the defiance they experience in their children. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play and weigh in with advice.Parenting strategist and licensed family therapist Tricia Ferrara listened to Estes and wondered whether she's walking into situations with her son armed more with \"hope\" than a real plan to deal with his behavior.\"A suggestion ... is kind of 'strike when the iron is cold' concept,\" said Ferrara, author of \"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\" a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. \"I feel like you're working real hard when you're in the heat of the moment but maybe not doing so much rehearsal outside of this World Series moment at the playground, when the stakes are really high,\" she said to Estes.Ferrara's advice was for Estes to come up with a plan: Promise the playground for Friday afternoon but say that \"we need to see 'big boy behavior' on the way to getting there.\"She said Estes could then come up with a few ways he could show that \"big boy behavior,\" such as getting dressed by himself or putting his toys away. \"If he's reluctant, remind him through that phrase. ... 'How about some \"big boy behavior?\" ' \"Ferrara, who has been in practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade, said a family mantra can also serve as a trigger for children on what they need to do. \"In my house, it was 'Fussing gets you nothing,' \" she said. \"So if [my kids] started to fuss about something, I would say, 'What does fussing get you?' And they would say, 'Nothing,' and then they would stop because it triggered them to say, 'Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to do X.' \" The problem with labeling a child as 'defiant'Parents may be quick to label their children as \"defiant,\" but experts say that fails to recognize that what we do as parents can impact our child's behavior.\"The problem with 'defiance' is that it puts something in the child,\" said Alan Kazdin, professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University and author of more than 40 books including \"The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child.\" \"It's not in the child. You can really make defiant children very compliant, actually, many of them, even most of them. It's in what you do to get that compliance.\"Kazdin, who is also director of the Yale Parenting Center, said that if a parent says a child is defiant, it means the child has the problem and the parent is fine. But the other way of thinking about that is the child didn't listen to the parent when the parent asked the child to do something, he said.\"And then now, here comes the science: Is there anything that science can tell us to get [the child] to be a really better listener and controlled better by [the parent's] behavior?\" said Kazdin, former president of the American Psychological Association. \"And the answer is wildly 'yes.' \"Kazdin says the way we convey instructions to our children affects the probability they will comply with our request.For instance, if you say \"Put on your jacket; we're going out\" while pointing at your child, you are likely to have less luck than if you put \"please\" in front of it: \"Please put your jacket on; we're going out.\"\"The tone of voice is the issue, not the 'please,' \" said Kazdin, who is also author of \"The Everyday Parenting Toolkit.\" That is why a working parent coming home after a stressful day is more likely to encounter some defiance from a child, he said. After a parent comes home and the child is being defiant, the parent might say, \"This is all I need after the day I've had.\"\"Well, what does the research show? That no fault of anybody but the stress changed the [parent's] tone of voice,\" said Kazdin. \"It's not about blaming, but I'm saying we put defiance in the child.\"Offering kids choice also increases the likelihood of compliance. \"Sally, put on your green jacket or your blue sweater, please,\" said Kazdin, is likely to lead to better results than simply \"Put on your jacket.\"\"The real choice is not anywhere near as important in life as the perception of choice, and so it doesn't matter that the child doesn't have a real choice,\" said Kazdin. \"What matters is that in giving that [choice], you increase compliance.\"The power of praising good behaviorWhat many of us parents fail to recognize is how important noticing and praising good behavior can be in terms of eliminating the defiance in our children. We don't tend to praise our children when they are getting along with their siblings, doing their homework or negotiating with other children on the ball field. But when they do something wrong or disobey us, we are quick to point that out.Praise the good behavior, says Kazdin, and be specific about it. Don't praise by saying \"wonderful girl\" or \"wonderful boy.\" Be specific, such as \"Great! I asked you to come over, and you came over right away,\" and then add a high five or a kiss on the cheek.\"It's the strategic praise that changes behavior when used in a way that follows [the] behavior immediately,\" he said.We also need to help our kids practice and practice with them, said Kazdin. For instance, I'm already dreading starting the school year and finding a way to get my younger daughter to get out of bed on her own.Kazdin says I could make a plan with my daughter the night before and promise to help her get up in the morning. Once she gets up, I should then praise her and tout how we did it together. After doing that for a few days, I could then say to my daughter that I bet she can't get up on time on her own the next morning, how it's something teenagers can do but perhaps she isn't big enough yet to do it.If my daughter does get up on her own, I can have kind of an \"ecstasy exchange\" in which I praise her profusely for getting up by herself and give her plenty of high fives, said Kazdin.The idea is to help my child as much as possible in the beginning, be there to hold her hand and praise her, and eventually she will start doing it on her own. But it won't happen overnight, he said.\"The issue is, you have to build the behavior gradually,\" said Kazdin. \"That's the critical part. ... Practice, repeat it, practice.\"What do you think is the best way to deal with defiant children? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter @kellywallacetv.

{"_id":"Parent Acts: How to stop a kid's meltdown","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.  (CNN)In my house, we called it going boneless. That's when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or I could do to satisfy them. If you have kids and you've experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions -- embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn't seem to work when your child is at wit's end and unable to calm down.We recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called \"Parent Acts.\" Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.Pauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is \"7-years-old but sounds more like 13.\"Case in point: Hilborn's daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn't do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.\"She came out crying and said, 'Ariana Grande's ponytail is here not here,'\" said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.\"I was at a loss for words,\" she said. \"I had no idea what to say but my husband said, 'Well, she's right you know,' which didn't help the situation.\"Debi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. When I asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it's when you cry a lot. When I asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.\"I completely freeze in those situations,\" she said. \"I lose all rational sense of now what do I do  ... I don't know how to do it without bribing him, so I end up taking away things.\"Help is on the way Tricia Ferrara is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. She's also author of \"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\" a guide book for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children.Ferrara listened to our parent volunteers imitate exactly what their children do and say during a meltdown, and then offered her advice:No. 1 -- Try to prevent itYes, you can actually prevent a meltdown, said Ferrara, a mom of two teens. Kids get tired and hungry, and then they can't tell you what's going on. \"You want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,\" and avoid outings at the end of the day when it's still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (I wish I had this in mind that time I decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. Not a smart move.)No. 2 -- Disregard what other people thinkWhile it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people watching us during those cringe-worthy moments when our kids are yelling at the top of their lungs and people are definitely noticing. \"I always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,\" she said. \"Escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear.\" Think of yourself as a \"tuning fork,\" said Ferrara. \"The calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.\"No. 3 -- Create a small upside for them Adults sometimes have to look for creative ways to maintain authority, and eliciting small concessions from your child can go a long way, said Ferrara. \"Create one bit of upside even if it's, 'You take one breath and we count to three together [then] we can get you want you want, and then we'll go home,' she explained. \"What that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.\" No. 4 -- Don't leave home without a strategy The \"biggest mistake\" parents make is they go into situations \"without a strategy,\" said Ferrara. \"Do you go to the hair dresser without a plan? A business meeting? Go buy a car? No, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,\" she said.  Remember Debi, the mom who said her son sometimes has meltdowns when he can't get what he wants? Ferrara said before heading out or going anywhere, she could tell her son that how he behaves is going to determine whether he could do something else, such as play with his birthday presents that evening. \"And so when he starts to behave in a way that is not acceptable to you, instead of getting into the verbal joust with him, you can say, 'Do you want to play with your birthday presents?' You can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that he understands,\" said Ferrara to Debi. \"If you rock back a bit and anticipate a little more and be a little more strategic, you might get better results from him,\" she said. \"And after consistency, he's going to know, 'Oh it's a new day.'\"No. 5 -- Help children convey how they feelWhen the body is flailing, that often means the language is not working, said Ferrara. For example, in the case of Hilborn, the mom who's daughter melted down after the ponytail disaster, Ferrara said she could have said to her daughter, \"Honey, if you need help, say it. Say 'Mom, I need help changing the ponytail.' That language helps her organize herself.\" \"You want your child to have an expectation of things, but she can't beat up on other people to get there, and certainly you can't stand in for that,\" Ferrara said to Hilborn. \"So what you want to do is teach her to say, 'I need help. I want this changed,' and then you can move in a more functional way.\"Oh, and another piece of advice? Teach Dad how to do the Ariana Grande ponytail! Have any good meltdown stories? We all do!

{"_id":"Parent Acts: When our kids hold a mirror to our shortcomings ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)When Grace Burley's daughter was 2, she sent her mom a very clear and expensive message.\"She was not at all a troublemaker, and she took my cell phone and threw it in the toilet,\" said Burley, a mom of two in Atlanta who is managing director of a strategic crisis firm, which means she is often fielding calls and emails when her kids are around.\"I had to laugh,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Yes, that is where that belongs.' \" Burley admitted that one of her biggest shortcomings as a parent is having trouble being present with her kids.In the fourth installment of our new CNN Digital Video series \"Parent Acts,\" we asked people to act out their shortcomings as parents and why it hurts so much when our kids point out those failings to us. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.Burley says her kids, ages 9 and 12, will say to her, \"Pay attention to me\" or \"Listen to me.\"When she hears that, no surprise, it doesn't feel very good. \"I mean, there's a lot of guilt, and it is sometimes hard to explain it and then shift the behavior, and it's a constant thing I'm working on, trying to listen to them, because I should be. That's my number one priority, but sometimes it's hard.\"I can relate. When I interviewed my younger daughter and her elementary school classmates for a Mother's Day video last year, asking children what they wish their mothers knew about them, my daughter said I \"lose my cookies\" too much. Translation: I get mad so quickly. Why does it hurt so much when our kids tell us something that we know is true?\"We're human. We have to say, as parents, we often feel like we have to be perfect,\" said Erik Fisher, a psychologist working in the Atlanta area and co-author of \"The Art of Empowered Parenting: The Manual You Wish Your Kids Came With.\"\"I have to be good and strong and right, and don't you dare point out to me anything that is bad or wrong or weak. But that's more about us, and that's more about our inadequacy, because if we're not perfect, what does that mean to us?\" Fisher asked.If we're not perfect, what does that say about the job we are doing as a parent?Bibbi Ransom, an Atlanta mom of two boys, ages 9 and 18, admits that she's a bit of a yeller and that her kids will tell her from time to time (maybe more than from time to time), \"Don't yell at me.\"For instance, when her kids have a reading assignment and they don't want to do it, she might respond by screaming, \"No, you need to do that now!\"Fisher, who listened to Ransom's role-play, said that when we parents fail in the moment and find that anger has taken over, we can take a moment to step back and think about how we could have handled it better.You can say to your children, \"Give me a few minutes so I can check myself,\" said Fisher. \"And then what ... you're teaching them (is)  'Oh, it's OK. I don't have to fix this right now. I can step back.' \" After some reflection, you can go back to your kids and explain why you reacted a certain way -- whether it was out of fear, guilt, shame, feelings of failure or inadequacy, whatever the reason. You also can praise your child for helping you learn more about yourself.\"People learn better and more quickly when they feel they are also committing or contributing to the learning process of somebody else,\" Fisher said. \"So when you have a child who is trying to teach and tell you something, you say, 'Wow, that was awesome. I loved what you taught me.' Then you are empowering them.\"In the case of Burley, the mom whose kids often tell her to pay attention to them, Fisher says she should do some self-reflection to figure out what is causing her to not be as engaged with her children as she would like to be, and then she should pose the question to her kids.\"Are there situations where you see me check out? What are those situations?\" Fisher suggested. Parents then need to be able to accept the truth from their kids and do something about it, he said. If you can't seem to change the behavior on your own, don't be afraid to ask someone else for help, whether it's a friend or a therapist, he said.\"As a parent, we might have every positive intention in the world to behave and be a certain way, but our behavior tells us something different, our kids are telling us something different, the world might be telling us something different, so you have to ask yourself, 'Why am I doing what I'm doing?' \"Do your children point out your shortcomings?

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)Laura Simms, a mother of three in Atlanta who runs her own public relations firm, says her 11-year-old daughter, Marlo, thinks her mom is right about nothing and wrong about everything and corrects her 24 hours a day.\" 'No, the sky is not blue. It's actually green.' 'No, it was $1.26, not $1.25, Mom.' 'No, we went on Friday, it wasn't Saturday,' \" said an exasperated Simms, relaying what her daughter might say to her. \"I literally stop and say, 'Am I right about anything anymore?' And my husband's like, 'No.' \" Any parent of a tween or teen can probably relate to what Simms is going through.In the ninth installment of our CNN Digital Video series \"Parent Acts,\" we asked parents to act out how their kids might demonstrate how they are wrong about everything. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play and weigh in with advice.Parenting strategist and licensed family therapist Tricia Ferrara listened to Simms and said that instead of focusing on whether she is right or wrong, she should \"pull the lens back\" a bit and focus on what's happening with her daughter.\"What she's developing is a communication habit of unsolicited opinion,\" Ferrara told Simms. She offered this approach to use: \"Instead of it being about whether you are right or wrong, almost like I can't do anything right or say anything right for my daughter, it's about, 'You know what, honey, let's have a time out, OK? If I asked your opinion of my answer, I would want to hear it.' \" Ferrara, the author of \"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\" a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said Simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: If her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend's house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion. \"Occasionally, I would ask them their opinion and say, 'What do you think of that?' so they have an understanding it's not that you don't want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.\"What also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said Ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.\"I see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,\" she said. \"And so that they think it's OK to do that in reverse.\"Having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author Dr. Claudia Gold, who is an infant mental health specialist. \"Depending on the degree, it's a normal developmental phenomenon.\"Before adolescence, it may be happening because the child's group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said Gold, author of \"Keeping Your Child in Mind\" and \"The Silenced Child.\" During adolescence, it may be related to the teen's desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.\"When they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it's a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,\" Gold said.Her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. The irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.What needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child's thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent's buttons, said Gold.\"So if it's happening a lot and people are really troubled by it, it really warrants a closer look and a little bit of time and attention to figure out the deeper story,\" she said.It may come from a place where the parent is not feeling heard at work or in their marriage, and so when they don't feel heard by their children, they're primed to jump at that behavior, she said. It may also stem from their relationship with their own parents when they were younger or other troubled relationships in their past.\"When it's hard to brush it off and you get angry and then you get entrenched in these battles and if this is the pervasive mood in your family that's taking up a lot of time and energy ... then it's a problem,\" Gold said.\"If it's really disruptive, there may be some deeper meaning to it.\"What do you do when your kids think everything you say or do is wrong?

{"_id":"Parent Acts: Why is it so hard to let our kids fail?","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)There is no question that one of the most difficult things about being a parent is letting our children stumble, fail, make mistakes. I wrote a story last January asking if it's OK to let our kids fail. I shared how difficult it was to let my then-7-year-old daughter bring a project to school she felt like she had put her heart into, but that I worried wouldn't measure up to what the other children might do.After listening to the experts and reading the research about how harmful our inability to let our kids stumble can be once they've grow into young adults, I admit I'm much better at pulling back. Still, l find myself struggling at times. For instance, the night before a math test, I wonder if I should try to find a way to do some practice math with my daughters. I know it's wrong and I shouldn't -- and I ultimately don't -- but that still doesn't mean I don't feel somewhat anxious about it.In the fifth installment of our new CNN Digital Video series \"Parent Acts,\" we asked people to act out how they handle those moments when they have a hard time letting their kids make mistakes. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play to weigh in with advice.Related: Brutally Honest: Is it OK to let your child fail?Deedee Abbott, a mother of two in Atlanta, says she finds it difficult to strike the right balance between encouraging her children to give their best when they're taking risks and making them feel she expects perfection.She shared the story of how her 9-year-old son starred in a play. The first two times she saw the play, he didn't pay attention on stage.\"When I gave him feedback, his immediate thing was, 'I can't. I can't pay attention,' \" said Abbott. \"And I said, 'Well, that's what you've been practicing to do. ... You're supposed to try.' And then he started crying. 'What if I try my hardest and you can't tell I'm trying?' \" After the third performance, he did a better job, so Abbott wonders if she should have stepped in sooner than she did, or if she should have never said anything?Erik Fisher, a psychologist working in the Atlanta area and co-author of \"The Art of Empowered Parenting: The Manual You Wish Your Kids Came With,\" said it's good for parents to not always step in. If we do, our children think they have to learn everything from us.After hearing Abbott's story, he told her it was great that she let her son trip and fall and only then gave him some feedback. \"You gave him some time to walk away and think about it,\" said Fisher. \"He solved the problem and came back and saw better results so understand that your kid might be upset in the moment,\" he told Abbott. \"You didn't break him. You have to help him become more self-reflective and that's what you want to talk about with him.\"What failure or mistakes do is they help us learn our way, said Fisher. After all, nobody in life succeeds 100% of the time. \"Teaching our kids ... to see the opportunity in what felt like tragedy, that's when we become better participants in life rather than people who would rather not play the game at all than play the game and lose.\"The struggle to be perfect Mark Leibert's son, 11, plays basketball and baseball. The Atlanta father of one admits he sometimes gets caught up in whether his son gave his best performance during a game.\"There are some moments where I just think, 'Why isn't he performing better?' ... and then I think, 'Well, what's going on with me in that situation?' \" He said he has learned from his mistakes, such as refraining from telling his son he should have gotten a rebound or talking about another specific moment in the game.\"I think in his own way, he's keeping tabs during a game of his own performance and so I probably am just reinforcing perhaps his own negative approach to it, so I'm trying to ease up on what he already does,\" said Leibert.By giving children space, letting them assess their own performance and figure out what they might need or want to do better next time, they develop the necessary skills to take on challenges later in life, Fisher said. When children are particularly hard on themselves and may have perfectionist tendencies, parents can step in to offer them perspective and help them strike the right balance.After hearing Leibert's story, Fisher told him, \"So you want to talk to (your son) and say, 'What can you do to do your best, love what you do and feel OK with learning (and) knowing that you don't have to be perfect?'  ... Let's look out 20 years. How that's going to be in 20 years when you are still expecting yourself to be perfect. What might that feel like if you make a mistake?' \" 'Focus on process over end product'When I first explored this topic last year, I interviewed Jessica Lahey, whose book, \"The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed,\" was published last summer. It has since become a New York Times best-seller and will be published in paperback in August.Her biggest piece of advice for parents back then was to try to stay away from the focus on end results, particularly grades and test scores. Instead, praise the effort that went into the task.I circled back with Lahey, who is also a writer for the Atlantic, The New York Times and Vermont Public Radio, to ask if that key advice had changed after a year of traveling the country and talking to parents, educators, administrators and students about the importance of failure. Her advice still stands, she said.\"The question I get most often is from parents who are in the same boat I was in a few years ago,\" she said via email. \"I knew I was overparenting and rescuing my kids from discomfort and frustration, but I did not know how to START turning that boat around.\"The first thing any parent needs to head in the right direction of letting kids fail is to keep a focus on learning above all else, she said. \"Focus on process over end product, long-term goals of competence and independence over the short-term rewards of stepping in to 'help' and make our kids' lives easier,\" she said.\"Any time you find yourself jumping in to rescue or take over a task for your kids, stop and ask yourself, 'Can my kid learn anything from this?' and if the answer is yes, whether that lesson is in a concrete skill or simply a moment to realize that they are more capable than they thought, restrain yourself. Hold your tongue. Lace your fingers together behind your back, and give your kids the opportunity to find out what they are able to do on their own.\"I'll be reading that message over and over again for a good long time.Do you have a hard time letting your children fail?

{"_id":"Parents find campaign offers teachable moments to discuss sexual assault ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.This story contains graphic language. (CNN)Some of the most important topics that we should be discussing with our children are often the toughest, and sex and sexual assault are definitely in that category.So many parents look for a way in to have \"the talk\" or many talks with their children about these issues.Who knew that a presidential campaign that's unlike any in recent history would provide a treasure trove of teachable moments for parents about consent and sexual assault?In my conversations over email with parents across the country, mothers and fathers said they are using Donald Trump's comments on the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape and allegations that he kissed and groped several women against their will as a way to talk to their children about what's appropriate language and behavior and what is inappropriate and illegal.Amy Robinson, a mother of three, said she has had multiple conversations with her 19-year-old daughter about what she is hearing, experiencing and observing as a woman.A recent conversation led to the subject of sexual harassment in the workplace and the \"dance\" that women often do in their heads, beginning with \"Did that just happen?\" and often ending with \"Surely, that didn't happen. I must be crazy\" or \"I don't want to come across as weak or sounding like a bitch,\" relayed Robinson, the founder of Tribe of Women, an organization dedicated to building cultures of women and more good men.Since that conversation, her daughter has come home with stories in which she has spoken up for herself in situations where she might have previously hesitated, she said.Robinson has also talked to her boys, ages 11 and 15, especially after the tape of Trump's vulgar comments about women surfaced. \"I've been heartened to hear how disgusted by Donald Trump's remarks they have been, especially as a supposed leader,\" Robinson said. \"In that regard, what we've ended up talking about is how we are all leaders, every day. That just because they are young doesn't meant that they don't have an opportunity to influence what is around them.\"Micky Marie Morrison also has two boys and used the tape and Trump's defense that this was just \"locker room talk\" as a way to explain to her sons, ages 10 and 14, the difference between speaking lewdly and actual sexual harassment and assault.\"I feel it's important for my boys to learn that not only is it inappropriate and disrespectful for them to talk about women the way they have heard on the Trump tape, it is beyond disrespectful and, in fact, illegal for a man to touch a woman without her consent,\" said Morrison, founder of BabyWeight TV and author of \"Baby Weight: The Complete Guide to Prenatal and Postpartum Fitness.\"\"They definitely understand now that the big deal about the tape was not the lewd speech. It was that a presidential candidate was bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, because he could, and that is assault.\"Having age-appropriate conversations is keyParents of younger children say they, too, are using the news from the presidential campaign to have conversations with their kids but are editing out the most salacious details and talking to their children in age-appropriate ways.Buzz Bishop is a father of two boys, ages 6 and 9, in Calgary, Alberta. \"I'm not getting into detailed conversations with them, but I am explaining that when two people kiss, it has to be because two people want to. You're not allowed to do something to someone they don't want to have happen to them,\" said Bishop, a broadcaster who writes about parenting on his blog DadCAMP. \"We're having consent conversations but in language that is appropriate to their age and understanding.\"The language that has been used during the campaign, in particular the language Trump used on the tape, has certainly led to some unusual moments for parents of younger children.Avital Norman Nathman, whose son is 9, said he heard someone use \"pussy\" and asked what that was. \"So we ended up talking about it,\" said Nathman,  founder of The Mamafesto blog and editor of the anthology on motherhood \"The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality.\" \"I'd rather he get an explanation from me than from a fellow 9-year-old.\"Beth Engelman, a single mother of an 11-year-old son, said that while this may be an \"incredibly dark period\" in American politics, she believes there is a \"silver lining\" in the ability of parents to teach their children to do things differently.She said she has talked with her son about what it means to objectify women, what it means to invade someone's personal space and touch them inappropriately, and how if you hear someone saying something offensive, you either disagree or walk away, because high-fiving the person or egging them on is just as offensive.\"I think these are really good things to talk about with an 11-year-old boy, but I hate that they come up because of one of our presidential nominees,\" said Engelman, co-founder of the digital platform Mommy on a Shoestring. \"I don't think 'protecting' my son means not letting him see the debates or watch the news for fear of what Trump might say. I think protecting him means arming him with insight about the issues and reinforcing values that will help him make good decisions going forward.\"Parents find that getting personal helps Some parents find that talking about their own experiences growing up is a way for their children to truly understand the ramifications of sexually offensive language and sexual assault.GG Benitez, a mother of three, had her children listen to the entire Trump tape from beginning to end. She explained to her 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter how nobody has the right to touch anybody else without their permission and how it is never something to joke about, because women and men have been victimized by such behavior, and it can affect them their entire lives.She then explained to her son that bragging to other boys about what girl he might kiss one day or talking in more detail than that may make him feel good in the moment, but it may come at the expense of how the girl will feel.\"I then shared with my kids some personal stories from high school about girls I knew who had their self-esteem destroyed when boys had done this,\" said Benitez, who founded and runs the public relations firm GG Benitez & Associates. \"I want both my daughter and son to be aware, respect themselves and others always, and to be open to discussing these topics with me.\"The presidential campaign has really presented parents with a chance to get into a topic they might not have addressed with their kids for years.\"This is an excellent opportunity to have an open discussion about sexual consent and what is not consent, especially for children 12 and older,\" said Louise Sattler, a psychologist and owner of Signing Families, a company focused on teaching the basics of sign language to people of all ages and abilities. Parents can also expand the scope of the conversation and discuss predators who use social media.\"So, we don't need to frame it as a political conversation but one of safety,\" Sattler said.Katia Bishops, a mom of two boys in Toronto, said she has really been thinking long and hard about how to make Trump's comments and the allegations against him a learning moment for her children.She said she has enough faith in her children's characters to know that they wouldn't prey on someone weaker, but she wonders what she can do to make sure she raises empowered bystanders.\"How do you raise children who are confident enough to not participate in that kind of discourse and to put a stop to it when they encounter such offensive rhetoric?\" asked Bishops, who blogs about parenting and tackled this issue in a recent post for a parenting website in Canada. The way to do it, she said, is \"by concentrating on teaching children how to say no and by explaining the meaning of consent over and over again whenever a day-to-day opportunity presents itself.\"For instance, making it clear to her children that they do not make decisions regarding their sibling's body is one way to make the point, said Bishops, whose kids are 4 and 7. So is not continuing to brush a sibling's hair if they object.The issue is close to home, she says, since she realized that when she faced sexual harassment at different times in her life, she never learned how to say \"no,\" \"stop\" or \"I don't like this.\"So now she is focusing on her children, making sure they know how to say no and to advocate for themselves and the rights of others when those rights are being violated, she said.\"I'll know that I've succeeded if I ever hear that upon witnessing injustice, (my sons) felt infuriated and outraged, not shocked and embarrassed,\" she wrote.Have you used any issue during the presidential campaign as a teachable moment for your kids?

{"_id":"Parents of separated twins focus on gratitude this Thanksgiving","articleText":"New York (CNN)The package was delivered to the 10th-floor hospital room and addressed to Jadon and Anias McDonald, the twins born conjoined at the head whose separation surgery has inspired millions around the world.The return address was the Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Inside were hand-drawn pictures, homemade poems and an assortment of get-well notes and prayers for the boys. From prisoners. \"It's the best gift I've ever gotten,\" says the twins' mom, Nicole McDonald. Nicole and her husband, Christian, wish the rest of the country could experience what they've seen and felt over the past month.Generosity and gratitude. They're what Thanksgiving Day is all about, but they sometimes seem in short supply after an election that frayed nerves and divided families. And each news cycle brings another array of headlines that test people's resolve. Nicole and Christian have seen a much different America, one filled with kind, loving and selfless people. From hugs and stuffed animals to donations and messages of support, the parents have been left in awe. Donations to their GoFundMe page to cover the boys' medical expenses have skyrocketed from about $50,000 before the surgery to nearly $300,000.The parents don't quite understand the outpouring. They wonder: Why us? Why our boys? But a nice note from a single stranger can turn an excruciating day -- one filled with tears -- into a more optimistic one. The messages come almost daily via Facebook or in the mail. Most carry similar themes: I think about your boys and pray for them every day.\"When you're just about running out of gas, it's the constant fuel that not only feels good because people care so much, it rejuvenates me in a way that I can't explain,\" Nicole says. Christian says he appreciates people's prayers more than anything. \"I know God hears prayers,\" he says. \"I think our prayers did influence God to help out.\"And that is their message this Thanksgiving: Use the positivity shown to their boys and roll that energy into doing something good for others. In their case, the parents have asked that donations be made to a friend whose child is in need of a kidney transplant. So much has been given to their family, they want to pay it forward.\"Instead of seeing the ugly hearts of people, I get to see the best hearts of people all the time,\" Nicole says. \"And it shows me continually that most people are good. We get this perception that most people aren't, but what I'm seeing is so amazing to me.\"In no way has their journey been easy. Nicole, 31, and Christian, 37, moved with the twins and their 3-year-old son, Aza, from their Illinois town of 5,000 to the Bronx to be near the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center. They quit their jobs and gave all their attention to their children. Seemingly every second of every day has been spent thinking about the twins, first before the surgery and then after. \"When we do something, we're going to do it fully and with our whole heart and to the best of our ability,\" Nicole says. \"And if that means sacrificing self for as long as we need to give our children the chance they need to thrive in life, then it's the best thing I've ever given up myself for.\"Adds Christian, \"We've really served our boys a lot and basically put our lives on hold for our boys and put them first.\" There have been many firsts since the 27-hour surgery ended on October 14: the first time the twins slept in separate beds. The first time they saw each other face to face. The first time they were held. Holding each child separately was surreal and beautiful for Nicole. Jadon was the first one she held. \"He just got quiet, and I just rocked him, and it was great. Great isn't even the right word. I don't know a word,\" she says.Anias was different. He was crying and fussy one night about 6 p.m. when she first held him, putting him on her shoulder. When that did little to calm him, she moved him into the crook of her arm. \"He stopped crying instantly, and he looked up at me with those two huge brown eyes and just watched my face. I rocked him back and forth. I could feel his whole body just loosen.\"When they were conjoined, the twins were confined to a single bed. When one child needed to be consoled, Nicole found it hard to give him her full attention. Her eyes would shift back and forth, and she could never focus on one baby. She thought of that as Anias -- who has struggled more than Jadon since the surgery -- fell asleep in her arms. \"I was singing to him, and I was able to just focus on his face, and his eyes would flutter, close and then pop open to make sure I was still there.\"He was just as amazed with me as I was with him.\"Yet between the moments of firsts have been moments of anguish. The boys have battled infections, fevers and seizures. Infections near Anias' brain forced doctors to remove the skull cap they had fashioned out of the boys' conjoined skull. His scalp is now the only thing covering the top of his head. He will eventually undergo more surgery to have a new skull cap inserted, but that is years down the road. Until then, he will wear a protective helmet. The parents try to focus on the positive. Both boys are progressing faster than any other craniopagus twins who've undergone surgery. Both are beginning to show signs of their old selves: Jadon, the rambunctious one, and Anias, the contemplative one. Mom spends almost all her time in their room. Dad tends to 3-year-old Aza, does the laundry, fetches groceries and makes sure the bills get paid. As if worrying about the twins wasn't enough, Aza recently got hand, foot and mouth disease. That forced his parents to be away from the twins for five days to make sure Jadon and Anias didn't get sick. Nicole, Christian and Aza went to Boston, to visit a city they had never been to before. Nicole is actually thankful Aza got sick: \"It gave me time with him for a change.\"On Thursday, at the family's temporary Bronx home, Nicole will prepare a donated turkey and other traditional Thanksgiving favorites. Her grandparents will join them for the feast. They won't dwell on their worries. They'll emphasize their gratitude. \"When you're in huge rough patches of life, you can either focus on the tough, or you can find the things to be grateful for,\" Nicole says. \"And in doing so, we're able to get through it in a positive way.\"Their wish this day is that America will do the same.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/health/conjoined-twins-parents-thanksgiving/index.html"}

{"_id":"Paul Nuttall replaces Nigel Farage as UKIP leader ","articleText":" (CNN)Paul Nuttall, a 39-year-old Member of the European Parliament, will replace Nigel Farage as leader of the UK Independence Party.A frontrunner to take the party's reigns, having served as deputy leader for the last six years, Nuttall was elected with 62.6% of support from party members, brushing aside his main rival, Suzanne Evans, the party's former deputy chairwoman who came in second with 19.3% of votes. A total of 32,757 ballot papers were sent to UKIP members, with 15,405 votes cast in the contest, the party said. UKIP will now look to its new leader to help stabilize the party after a turbulent few months that saw several senior members quit and multiple leadership elections held. Nuttall, the MEP for north-west England, will replace Nigel Farage, who returned to the helm as interim party leader in early October when his successor, Diane James, stepped aside after just 18 days in the job. Farage, who quit following the UK referendum to leave the European Union, has overseen few party duties in the last month, instead spending time in the US, supporting President-elect Donald Trump. As Nuttall took the podium following his electoral victory, he called on his party to unite, \"because only unity breeds success.\" \"The country needs a strong UKIP more now than ever before,\" said Nuttall in his acceptance speech. \"For if UKIP ceases to be an electoral force then there will be no impetus on Theresa May and her government to give us real Brexit.\"He added: \"And what we will end up with is some mealy-mouthed backsliding version which doesn't allow us to control our own borders, which doesn't allow us to sign our own trade deals, which doesn't allow us to make all of our laws.\" A party dividedShortly after Nuttall was named, a Conservative party spokesman responded criticizing UKIP's fractured landscape in a statement which read: \"Now on their third leader in as many months, UKIP are too divided, distracted and incompetent to offer any serious solutions for the people of Britain.\"After a leadership contest which the winner himself has described as 'completely shambolic,' we've seen brawls and squabbling -- but nothing about the issues facing ordinary working people.\"It's the Conservative Party which held a referendum and is now delivering on the people's verdict.

{"_id":"Pelosi challenger steps up criticism ahead of leadership fight","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Rep. Tim Ryan is accusing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of seeking to \"further consolidate her power\" as he tries to stoke antipathy over her long tenure as the Democratic leader ahead of this week's leadership elections.Ryan, an Ohio Democrat in his seventh term, is mounting an uphill battle to defeat Pelosi in the Wednesday elections, seizing on the Democrats' disappointing election results and continued status in the House minority to call for changes at the top of his caucus.Who is Tim Ryan?While Pelosi remains a prohibitive favorite, she has taken a series of steps aimed at easing House Democratic concerns that rank-and-file members -- particularly those elected in recent elections -- have little influence over the messaging and strategy. So Pelosi has sent two letters to her colleagues laying out a series of changes she'd like to make, including giving more junior members a bigger say at the leadership table.And on Monday evening after Ryan publicly criticized Pelosi, she sent a third letter, telling her caucus she would bring a freshman Democrat into the leadership ranks while putting off an idea that irked at least one member of the Congressional Black Caucus.But Ryan said Pelosi's initial changes did not go far enough.\"I am very disappointed in Leader Pelosi's proposed caucus reforms which are seemingly designed to further consolidate her power over the caucus,\" Ryan said in a Monday statement. \"There is a clear desire among our members to democratize the Democratic Caucus by returning more power to our rank and file members.\"Pelosi's office declined to respond to Ryan's criticism, but the Monday letter seemed designed to respond to some of her challenger's attacks.Ryan says Pelosi should change how Democrats select the leadership of the House Democrats' main campaign arm -- the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- to give members more say in influencing the direction of the group. And Ryan is seizing on criticism leveled by Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond -- a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus -- who privately told his CBC colleagues over the Thanksgiving holiday that some of Pelosi's changes could have \"severe unintended consequences that could diminish our power within the Democratic Caucus.\"\"We must continue our efforts to democratize the caucus and decentralize the power of the Democratic leader so each member of our caucus plays a role in our future path,\" Ryan said.Ryan has just seven public endorsements, with the latest from Alcee Hastings of Florida, whose office told CNN Monday he's backing the Ohio Democrat for the job. While Pelosi has said confidently she has the support of two-thirds of the caucus, Ryan's aides said that the race is much closer, especially since a secret ballot election gives members a chance to vote their will without fear of repercussion.Pelosi has been resistant in the past to diffusing the power of the leadership, but under increasing pressure from members who have pushed for specific changes she announced her support for some proposals to provide more opportunities for more junior members to serve in senior committee posts or newly created leadership positions. She proposed that the current third-ranking position, called the \"assistant leader\" position that is now held by South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, be switched to an elected position awarded to members who have served fewer than three terms. Pelosi created the job after Democrats lost control of the House in 2010 and gave it to Clyburn, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who worked as the chief vote counter. Now she says that job should be held by a member who has been in Congress fewer than three terms -- after Clyburn leaves office. After criticism from the CBC members, Pelosi said Monday she would shelve discussion about the proposal to elect an assistant Democratic leader until a later time.\"Since the proposal addressing the Assistant Democratic Leader position is one that does not apply to this Congress, any further discussion should occur through the Committee on Organization, Standard and Review,\" Pelosi told her colleagues.Following the 2014 midterms, Pelosi added a position to the leadership team to focus on message development.  She tapped New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel for that job, but she says she wants that post expanded to go to three \"co-chairs\" and suggests they should be drawn from those who have been in the House for less than 10 years. On Friday, Pelosi nominated Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star from the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Cheri Bustos from Illinois and Rep. Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania to be the new co-chairs for this effort in the next Congress.She also tapped California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, already a close ally of hers who led an effort to reach millennial voters, as a co-chair of the internal group that determines committee assignments for House Democrats.As a way to boost profiles of younger members on various committees, Pelosi is proposing that each panel add a \"vice chair\" with the requirement that those be given to members who have served less than four terms in the House.A senior Democratic aide said the Pelosi proposals were not a final decision made by the minority leader -- and would only serve as a basis of future discussions within the Democratic Caucus.There was grumbling within the caucus that Pelosi's plans still did not give enough say to freshman members. So on Monday evening, Pelosi also proposed including a freshman in leadership discussions.Still, Pelosi's move has irked at least one member of the influential CBC. In a letter last week to his colleagues, Richmond said that such proposals could hurt veteran members -- including many in the CBC -- who currently hold just one leadership position. Moreover, he raised concerns over Pelosi's proposal to turn the assistant leader position into an elected leadership spot for a more junior member -- given that it is currently held by Clyburn, the veteran CBC member.\"We must make sure that we do not send the message that, of the top three leaders, the assistant leader bears the blame for the losses,\" Richmond said.Ryan seized on that criticism in his statement Monday.\"That is why my proposed reforms would not change this position, but instead add to the current leadership team a new elected position reserved for members with three terms or less,\" Ryan said.This story has been updated.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/tim-ryan-nancy-pelosi-leadership-race-democrats/index.html"}
{"_id":"Pelosi challenger: Democrats lost economic focus","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat challenging Nancy Pelosi for the party's House leadership, faulted the House minority leader on Sunday for focusing too narrowly on issues such as Zika virus funding in the lead-up to the election. \"We were talking a lot about issues that weren't deeply economic, and I think that provided a huge opening for Donald Trump to come in, and that led to the disaster that happened on Tuesday,\" Ryan said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\" He pointed out that a month before Congress left Washington to hit the campaign trail full time, Democrats were battling for increased funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the Zika virus. \"That's not a deep economic message that's a national message; that's a message in a couple (of) regions in the country. And I think things like that throw us off track,\" Ryan said. \"We need a brand as a party that says, we are the party that is going to help working-class people -- white people, black people, brown people, gay people, straight people; improve opportunity for them to grow their wages, to have security, economic security,\" he said. \"We got off that message, and when we don't talk about economics, we lose elections.\" A Pelosi spokesman disputed Ryan's claim that Zika was a more important message priority than the economy, and noted that Ryan, too, had called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to \"hold an immediate vote on emergency aid\" on Twitter in August.Ryan described Democrats as in the middle of a \"family fight.\" In a blow to Pelosi, House Democrats postponed their leadership election that had originally been expected to take place last week. Ryan said he lives in a district where Trump beat Hillary Clinton -- and that the party's path back to a House majority requires winning some of those seats. \"I know who these people are. Some of them are friends of mine, neighbors of mine, who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We have to get those people back into the fold, and as I told my colleagues, I know in my heart that we cannot win the House back under the current leadership. It's time for a change.\" Ryan said he's willing to work with Trump -- as long as Trump doesn't cross Democrats on some of the party's top priorities. \"If he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we're going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol. That's what's going to happen,\" he said. \"If he has other opportunities where we can grow the economy, where we can invest in working-class people -- knowing that one-third of working-class people are people of color, so this is a broad coalition -- then we will look for places to look for him.\" Tapper asked Ryan whether infrastructure is one potential area of cooperation. But Ryan said so far, Trump's infrastructure proposal \"looks like a bunch of smoke and mirrors and corporate giveaways.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/tim-ryan-house-democrats-pelosi-trump/index.html"}

{"_id":"Pelosi fight exposes Democratic fault lines, puts power to check Trump in question","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Democrats laid one battle for the future of the party to rest Wednesday, selecting Nancy Pelosi as their leader in the House of Representatives for another two years. But the fight over Pelosi's future, and the battle to lead the Democratic National Committee, have laid bare their upcoming difficulties in any effort to put a check on President-elect Donald Trump and the strong Republican majority.Whether it's the messenger or the message, Democrats agree that something needs to change following the stunning losses on Election Day.Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and veteran member of the Congressional Black Caucus, blamed an inside-Washington mentality on recruiting candidates that led to consistent losses. \"I think we have to seriously look at this over-reliance on political consultants and media consultants and pollsters rather than going with member input,\" Thompson said. \"When you lose overall, in the last few years, the number of seats that you've lost. I think it requires us to look at what our business model is. And if you're business model is not one that's winning, then obviously you'd be remiss not to change it.\"As Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan walked out of his unsuccessful bid to take control of the House Democrats, he claimed victory on procedural issues and promises to focus on economic messaging he said resonates through the blue-collar districts like his that Trump won. But when he was asked who should lead that fight for Democrats, he stumbled. \"I don't know,\" Ryan said. (He eventually caught his footing, saying: \"We're all going to participate in leading the party.\")And even Nancy Pelosi -- who had just won a grueling fight to head the Democrats for another two years -- struggled to shrug off the almost one-third of Democratic lawmakers who voted against her. \"They weren't defections,\" she said when asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan. \"I got two-thirds of the vote.\"The Democrats' difficulties can be seen elsewhere on Capitol Hill as well. Democrats on the House Oversight and Judiciary panels continued hammering away for an investigation of Trump's conflicts of interest -- after spending years digging into Clinton's dealings as secretary of state -- but have gained almost no ground in the Capitol, as Republican leaders have been circumspect on the issue, and likely won't be game for investigating a president from their party. In the Senate, the Democrats' own decision to end the filibuster for presidential nominees, has left them largely unable to put a check on Trump's cabinet picks, the people who will attempt to undo much of President Barack Obama's eight years in office.And Rep. Keith Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat and first Muslim elected to Congress, ducked and dodged reporters outside the Democratic leadership fight who were asking about his bid to take over the Democratic National Committee. While just a few feet away was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was forced out as chairwoman of the DNC in the middle of their own party convention in Philadelphia, over allegations the party aided Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the presidential primaries.Attention on PelosiDemocrats actually won an additional six seats inside the House on Election Day, but it marked the fourth consecutive election in which they seemed hopelessly lost in the minority. All this has led Democrats to call for some deep changes to how Pelosi runs the show, including requesting that the people searching to run the party's campaign arm -- the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- present their game plans for vetting before the House Democrats select that leader.As the almost 200 members of the House Democratic caucus circulated in and out of the marbled room-turned arena, they sought to downplay the deep divisions exposed by yet another losing cycle. But It's clear that some of Pelosi's critics feel emboldened by the significant vote -- 63 members voting against her remaining in the top slot, 20 more than the last time she beat back a challenge in 2010.\"She doesn't have to be weaker, she just has to listen to us.  She has to be open to new ideas and listen to new voices, because clearly there are a lot of people inside the caucus who are dissatisfied,\" Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton told CNN.Moulton said his constituents back home have been \"unanimously positive\" about his role pushing for a new voice at the top of House Democratic leadership and he's not concerned about any blowback for publicly criticizing Pelosi.Two Democrats who supported Pelosi told CNN that Tim Ryan's pitch to members inside the closed door meeting was a very effective speech, and was a good argument for why new messengers are needed.But Pelosi had a broad and sharp array of supporters lay out their arguments in the meeting. \"No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, argued, according to a Democratic aide in the room. And Debbie Dingell, who represents the Michigan seat formerly held by veteran Democrat John Dingell, argued that Pelosi was listening to Rust Belt Democrats like her. \"I have spoken endlessly about what is happening in the Midwest. Leader Pelosi always listened and she always understood,\" Dingell said, according to the Democratic aide. \"We need someone who is battle tested.\"And even with the end of one fight -- the other, for chair of the DNC is just gearing up -- with candidate forums across the country set to pit Ellison against a host of others looking to take control of the party. Top Republicans, meanwhile, basked in the fissures which have Democrats hamstrung at the moment. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway laughed at the fighting in a tweet sent just after Pelosi won re-election. \"What a relief. I was worried they had learned from the elections & might be competitive and cohesive again,\" Conway tweeted.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/politics/democratic-party-fault-lines/index.html"}

{"_id":"Penn Jillette: Time for atheists to stand up and be counted","articleText":"Penn Jillette, a writer, television host and frequent guest on a wide range of shows, is half of the Emmy Award-winning magic act duo Penn & Teller. His new book \"Presto\" comes out in August. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)This weekend on the Mall in Washington, a bunch of atheists — tens of thousands, including me -- will get together just to be counted as not having a personal god.  Why? Whether the pollsters bemoan it or celebrate it, the percentage of Americans who are losing their religion is rising.  And in a presidential election year, candidates need to take note.Two of those remaining, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, still give lip service to being religious -- even if many on either side of religion don't believe them or want to claim them. (Why would this be the only thing either one of them would tell the truth about?)The Libertarian candidate, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who has the most executive experience and the least amount of experience lying, seems to never mention god.  He's the one who believes that separation of church and state gives the most freedom for theists and atheists. This tracks with a growing reality about religion in America. And those of us who are atheists -- living godless since forever -- have been trying to get a hint as to why so many are suddenly seeing through the glass darkly. Some think the September 11 attacks caused a big spike in atheism, as many people hipped to the fact that a benevolent god wouldn't allow that to happen.  I don't think that was it. I don't think that day created a lot of atheists, but I think it made a lot of atheists want to speak up a little more. After that day, the immorality of letting religion run wild, while atheists kept quiet and enjoyed delicious potluck suppers full of community and Jell-O, was inescapable.  Smiling and turning the other cheek to the belief in nonsense-without-proof, while enjoying the loving culture and community, had consequences. I'm from New England and I'll drop to my knees for community and Jell-O. My dad was a Christian his whole life, and my mom didn't say she was an atheist until she was in her 80s.  The Christians in my life have treated me wonderfully. My admitting there's no god has nothing to do with rebelling against them: I loved them then, with their honest smiles and weird-ass coffee Jell-O, and still do. But after 9/11 we had to find a way to celebrate community without condoning faith in things that can't be shared.  We had to be good Americans without god, and learn that we could still have our culture, our biblical references and our community, without feigning faith. After 9/11 we could no longer pretend that faith in god was harmless. The writing had been on the wall for a while, but now the walls were a-crumblin' down and innocent people were dying. Thousands of innocent people of all faiths died in that religious terrorist attack — including atheists.  Some people still balk at that word.  \"Atheist\" is \"homosexual\" without the word \"gay\" being available.  \"Atheists\" suffer in this designation: It defines us by inaction.  We try other words: \"humanist,\" \"non-religious,\" \"heathen,\" \"infidel.\" Some of us even lie about the term \"agnostic,\" and pretend that it means \"atheist with an open mind\" or \"atheist lite,\" but it really doesn't. \"Agnostic\" answers the epistemological question of how perfect knowledge can be,  but once you've said you're agnostic (which every sane person is), you still have to answer the theological question about your personal belief -- and that comes down to \"atheist\" or \"theist.\"  Then there's the deist thang: Maybe there's a force in the universe but it sure doesn't care about us as individuals and doesn't promise an afterlife. But a deist is really just an atheist before Darwin. It's possible there's always been a huge number of Americans living their lives without faith in a personal god, but now we're letting our freak flags fly. We're still in the minority. In fact it wasn't long ago that many people believed that in order to be taken seriously as a politician, you had to be a Bible thumper. After all, it's been said that Bill Clinton gave more speeches in churches than any other President in history. Many also believed the right wing was totally owned by hardcore Christians, but Ted Cruz proved that is no longer true.The only good news about Donald Trump, and this is from a rose-colored-glasses-crazy-optimist, is that Silly Donny shows us that even on the right wing, religion no longer really matters.  Trump wouldn't know a verse from the Bible if it were tattooed backward on his backside so he could read it in the mirror. As far as I'm concerned, that proves he's not an atheist, because every atheist I've met knows the Bible really well.This weekend on the Mall, some of the grooviest, smartest, most loving people in the country will get together and cheer about not having a personal god. Some of the ugliest, silliest, stupidest people will be there, too. We're all atheists. I'm going to sing a song.   It's time for people to see what atheists really look like.Atheists look like Americans.  We are Americans, and we've always been your neighbors and friends.  Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

It and other bodies urged reconciliation.Libya Fast Facts\"My sincere condolences to the victims' families.

Voices of reason should prevail, and quickly, for the benefit of the country,\" he said.Libya has more than 100 tribes -- some spreading across the country's borders with Egypt and Tunisia -- but only a few of them hold sway politically. There has been tension between the tribes over the years.Tribal tension unleashedThe new clashes started after a pet monkey owned by a member of the Gaddadfa tribe attacked a high school girl from the Suleiman tribe on Thursday.It scratched her face and pulled off her headscarf. Suleiman members retaliated and killed some Gaddadfa men. According to local reports, not yet confirmed by CNN, the monkey was also killed.  Violence persisted afterward. People stayed indoors as gunfire, tank cannons and mortar shells rang out in Sabha early Monday. The city is some 480 miles, or 775 kilometers, south of the nation's capital, Tripoli.Enmity runs deep between the Gaddadfa and Suleiman tribes, the most powerful armed factions in the region.Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was ousted from power and assassinated by rebels in 2011, was a member of the Gaddadfa tribe.The Suleiman had strongly resented his regime. Shortly after Gadhafi's death, members of the tribe were accused of plotting to overthrow him. Authorities work to stop violenceOsama Alwafi, a spokesman for the Sabha Medical Center, told CNN the facility has received more than 50 injured people along with 14 bodies. He said the center lacked the resources and the medical staff to handle the emergency.A member of another tribe who gave his name as Abdusalam and did not want to disclose his full name for security reasons, said that a committee of elder tribesmen from the south met with both parties to try to stop the fighting. Libya's UN-backed Presidential Council issued a statement, urging both parties to cease fire while expressing deep regret for the victims. \"The Council calls for an immediate halt to the clashes in the city and urge them to restraint and appeal to reason,\" the statement said. \"The Council has assigned the Interior Minister to open an urgent investigation to determine the causes and circumstances of the clashes and... instructed the Health Minister to follow up the conditions of the injured and the wounded.\"CNN's Kay Guerrero in Atlanta reported and wrote.

Petraeus, the former general and CIA director, was asked on ABC's \"This Week\" what he would say to Republican senators who are hesitant to vote to confirm a man who pled guilty to exactly what they spent months accusing Hillary Clinton of doing via her private email server. \"What I would say to them is what I've acknowledged for a number of years.

I paid a very heavy price for it and I've learned from it,\" he said. \"And, again, they'll have to factor that in and also obviously 38-and-a-half years of otherwise fairly in some cases unique service to our country in uniform and then at the CIA and then some four years or so in the business community, during which I've continued to travel the world -- nearly 40 countries -- in that time as well.\" His comments come as Trump considers a list of contenders for secretary of state that includes Petraeus. Also on that list: Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and former UN ambassador John Bolton, according to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Sources told CNN that former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China, is also under consideration. Trump frequently said on the campaign trail that what Clinton had done was far worse than Petraeus.

{"_id":"Pluto may have an icy sea beneath its surface","articleText":" (CNN)Dwarf planet Pluto may be hiding an icy ocean beneath its surface, according to two new reports published by the scientific journal Nature.The papers seek to explain why Sputnik Planitia -- a 1,000 kilometer-wide, nitrogen-covered basin in Pluto's heart-shaped northern region -- is permanently aligned with the dwarf planet's moon Charon. \"It's like they're in an arm-to-arm dance, always facing each other,\" said Richard Binzel, professor of planetary sciences at MIT, who was involved in the New Horizons mission to Pluto. The first paper, from the University of Arizona, suggests that Sputnik Planitia filled with ice and altered tidal forces between Pluto and Charon.The second, from the University of California, suggests the reorientation was caused by tidal forces as a result of a \"slushy,\" partially-frozen underground ocean.\"We find water almost everywhere we look,\" Binzel said. \"We are seeing nature making water as a very natural occurrence all across our solar system.\"New HorizonsClues emerged from data gathered from NASA's New Horizons space probe, which passed by Pluto in July 2015. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been a part of the New Horizons team.\"A thick, heavy ocean, the new data suggest, may have served as a 'gravitational anomaly,' or weight, which would factor heavily in Pluto and Charon's gravitational tug-of-war,\" according to MIT News. \"Over millions of years, the planet would have spun around, aligning its subsurface ocean and the heart-shaped region above it, almost exactly opposite along the line connecting Pluto and Charon.\"Sputnik Planitia is thought to have formed billions of years ago when an asteroid slammed into Pluto's surface, leaving behind a crater that filled up with nitrogen ice within the last 10 million years.

A narrow majority (53%), say they think Trump will do a very or fairly good job as president, and 40% say they have a lot of confidence in Trump to deal with the economy, a share that outpaces the percentage who had that much confidence in Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan ahead of their first inaugurations. Read full poll resultsThat perception comes as majorities think Trump will achieve several of the goals outlined during his campaign as top priorities. Nearly three-quarters say Trump is likely to repeal and replace Obamacare, two-thirds think he will renegotiate NAFTA and 6 in 10 say he'll create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas. Separately, 63% say they expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now, the highest share to say so since September 2012. Americans are more divided over whether Trump will \"drain the swamp\" and reduce the amount of corruption in Washington (51% think that's likely), defeat ISIS (50% see that as likely) or build a wall along the border with Mexico (48% see that as likely).  All told, 66% say a Trump presidency will bring change to the country, but just 43% say it will be change for the better, twenty points below the 63% who thought Obama would bring change for the better in November 2008. That share has dropped precipitously among independents (from 88% for Obama to 60% for Trump), and among Democrats, even when compared to Republican ratings of Obama (49% of Republicans thought Obama would bring change for the better, just 22% of Democrats say that about Trump).Trump's favorability has risen post-election to a high point in CNN/ORC polling: 47% have a favorable view of him, 50% unfavorable. Though still tilting negative, those ratings outpace the previous high reached just after the GOP convention in July, when 43% saw Trump favorably. RELATED: FEC hits Trump on 1,100 errors, totaling roughly $1.3MReviews are mixed for Trump's transition so far, 46% approve of his handling of the transition, 45% disapprove. Those marks are well below approval ratings for Obama, Bush or Clinton during their transitions to the presidency. Only about half (48%) say that Trump's statements and actions since Election Day have made them more confident in his ability to serve as president, while 43% say he's made them feel less confident since upsetting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton two weeks ago in a win that few saw coming. On one point of concern, few say Trump's efforts have gone far enough to assuage their worries. About 6 in 10 say the arrangement Trump has proposed for handling his business while serving as president -- to have his adult children run the Trump Organization -- does not go far enough to prevent conflicts. The poll suggests Trump is shaping up to be one of the most polarizing presidents-elect the nation has had in recent years. Alongside relatively high confidence in his ability to deal with the economy, there's also an outsized lack of confidence and a diminished middle-ground, a pattern that repeats on similar questions. While 40% say they have deep confidence in him to handle the nation's economy, 34% say they have no real confidence in him on that score, 7 points above the previous high of 27% for George W. Bush and nearly double the share who had no confidence in Obama on the economy (19%). Just a quarter fall into the middle category, saying they have \"some confidence\" in Trump. On handling foreign affairs, a weak point for Trump throughout the campaign for the presidency, confidence in the President-elect is sharply upside-down, yet still, few land in the middle. Almost half (49%) say they have no real confidence vs. 27% who say they have a lot of faith in the president elect, just 23% say they have \"some confidence.\" On both issues, Republicans are more confident in Trump's abilities to handle them than were Democrats in Obama's abilities or Republicans in Bush's abilities on the same issues. At the same time, Democrats express far less confidence in Trump on these issues than Republicans did about Obama or Democrats themselves did about Bush in 2000. Even among independents, the share expressing no confidence at all has increased double-digits over either Bush or Obama. The trend means more people land on the extremes when assessing this President-elect, and fewer take the middle ground.RELATED: Donald Trump outlines policy plan for first 100 daysOverall, Trump ranks toward the middle of the pack on providing leadership and making appointments, but here too, his no confidence numbers far outpace those for his predecessors. On providing real leadership, 33% have deep confidence, but 43% say they have no confidence. And thinking about appointing the best people to office, 32% say they have a lot of confidence in Trump, yet 45% say they have no confidence in him to choose appointees. These numbers could shift as Trump fills out his cabinet and staff; polling measuring confidence in previous presidents-elect was conducted closer to their inauguration after many critical appointments had been made.Several demographic divides that emerged during the campaign appear to persist post-election. Women are less apt to see Trump as a good president than are men, almost two-thirds of whites say he'll do a good job vs. about a third of non-whites, and residents of rural areas are more than twice as likely as urbanites to think Trump will do a good job. Among those in union households, a typically Democratic constituency where Trump had stronger appeal than most Republicans, 53% expect Trump to do a good job as president.Overall, the share saying things in the US are going well today has dipped from its late-October high, 47% say things are going well, down from 54% then. That shift is mostly partisan. While there has been an uptick in the share of Republicans who think things are going well (from 21% to 32%), the share of Democrats who say the same has dropped about twenty points (85% to 66%). About half of Americans overall say that four years from now, they expect the country to be better off than it is today, 46% say it'll be worse off and just 3% say it'll be the same. That's worse than impressions of how the country would be after four years of Obama, but a little better than assessments of how it'd be doing four years in to George W. Bush's presidency.The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone from November 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/donald-trump-presidency-poll-transition/index.html"}

{"_id":"Polyamorous community welcomes OkCupid feature for open relationships","articleText":" (CNN)Are you in an open relationship and looking for more love? Online dating site OkCupid wants to make the search easier for you.\"Couples Linking\" is a new feature that lets couples join their profiles. The feature is open to people who identify as \"seeing someone,\" \"married\" or \"in an open relationship\" and are looking for others to join their relationship. The feature will also help singles looking to join an open relationship by identifying non-monogamous couples in searches.The addition was welcomed by many who identify as non-monogamous or polyamorous, terms broadly used to describe people openly involved in relationships with more than one person. These communities already consider OkCupid the most welcoming of the major dating sites for already having settings to accommodate them.Polyamory: Multiple partners, without jealousyPolyamorous people have trouble finding like-minded potential mates on most mainstream dating sites simply because there's no way to search for them, said sex educator Anita Illig Wagner, founder of Practical Polyamory. And, monogamous people don't always appreciate being approached blindly with an invitation into an open relationship.\"It's a very big deal and I'm delighted that OkCupid has gotten this far with it,\" she said. \"I hope other sites take it seriously and we find ourselves welcome in even more major websites.\"OkCupid made \"open relationship\" and \"non-monogamous\" options for relationship status in 2014 and added 12 sexual orientation and 22 gender options, all believed to be firsts for a major dating site. \"You want to meet people like you so having the site identify you as non-monogamous is a very big deal,\" said Pepper Mint, a San Francisco-based  advocate for non-monogamy who organizes poly-friendly events.The new feature also looks promising for \"couples dating,\" he said -- two people looking for someone together without having to create a joint profile.There's no good measure of the amount of people who identify as non-monogamous or polyamorous because it's still a small group, Mint said. But as the concept becomes more well-known thanks to pop culture and politics more people are considering it for themselves.\"It's good news but it's not just OkCupid being generous,\" he added. \"It's well-known in the poly community that if you want to date online you go to OkCupid. What we're really seeing is non-monogamous purchasing power.\"OkCupid readily admits that the feature comes in response to growing interest among users in relationships with more than one person at a time, be it flings, casual hookups or committed relationships.Over the past five years the site has seen an increase in positive responses from users to questions about multiple partners, OkCupid chief product officer Jimena Almendares said. For example, in 2010, 39% of all users said \"I could be convinced by the right people\" when asked \"Would you consider being part of a committed polyamorous relationship?\"In 2015, people responding the same way to the same question rose by 6% among all users.As for the question \"Would you consider dating someone who is already involved in an open or polyamorous relationship?\" 42% of all users said yes in 2010. In 2015, half of users said they would.\"Now, couples can identify themselves, and users searching for a non-monogamous relationship can find them more easily,\" Almendares said. \"Also, users searching for monogamous relationships only will not see profiles of users in non-monogamous relationships.\"There's still room for improvement, Mint said. He would like to see \"polyamorous\" become a relationship status option. In the spirit of honesty and transparency that polyamory is predicated upon, being able to add more multiple partners to a profile would be another positive step forward, especially since many poly people don't seek out new mates as a couple.\"OkCupid has been making incremental changes and they're good but there's still farther to go,\" he said.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/01/08/living/okcupid-polyamorous-open-relationships-feat/index.html"}
{"_id":"Pope Francis extends Catholic priests' power to forgive abortion","articleText":" (CNN)Pope Francis has extended indefinitely the power of Catholic priests to forgive abortions, making the announcement in an apostolic letter released Monday.It continues a special dispensation granted last year for the duration of the Year of Mercy -- which finished Sunday -- which gave all priests, rather than just bishops and specially designated confessors, the power to absolve the sin of abortion.While the practical effect of Francis' announcement remains unclear, it draws attention to the prevailing theme of his papacy: That the doors of the Church must remain open, just as God's forgiveness and mercy extend to all those who repent from sin. That said, the Catholic Church's stance on abortion has not changed -- it is still viewed as a \"grave sin.\" But it makes it easier for women who have had abortions to be absolved for their actions, and rejoin the church. \"I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,\" the Pope's letter states.\"In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.\"The letter continues: \"May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation.\"I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.\"'Moral evil'Since the first century, the Catholic Church has held that abortion is a \"moral evil.\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that every human life \"from the moment of conception until death is sacred\" -- and that any Catholic who procures an abortion incurs automatic excommunication, a penalty that often only a bishop could lift.Saint John Paul II, whose papacy ran from 1978 to 2005, emphasized the traditional Catholic view on abortion, describing it as \"murder,\" and the church has been a strong force behind pro-life groups worldwide.According to canon law experts, John Paul already extended to priests the power to forgive abortion in 1983 when he updated the code of canon law, but only a bishop could lift the excommunication. But some bishops allowed priests to lift the excommunication as well, creating a patchwork of practices and some confusion among clergy.Kate D'Annunzio of Rachel's Vineyard, a Pennsylvania-based group that ministers to women who have had abortions, said Francis has \"clarified\" that now priests have the power to do both: forgive and welcome women back into the church. \"We are extremely ecstatic that the Pope is recognizing that the decision women have made has harmed them in so many ways, and they want to be reunited with the Church.\"The Church has had the ability to forgive these women, but many of these women had difficulty forgiving themselves. This outreach by the Pope is saying 'Don't isolate yourselves, come back to the church.'\"READ MORE: Pope Francis says all priests can forgive women who've had abortionsPope Francis initially introduce the church's clarified policies last year when he said that priests around the world would be authorized to forgive the \"sin of abortion\" for the duration of the Church's Year of Mercy, which ran from December 8, 2015 to November 20, 2016.The Year of Mercy is a longstanding Catholic tradition during which believers may receive special indulgences for their sins.\"The forgiveness of God cannot be denied to one who has repented,\" he said at the time, expressing sympathy for women who had been through the \"agonizing and painful\" decision to terminate their pregnancy.Priest: 'Another gesture of mercy and welcome'The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large at America magazine in New York, described Pope Francis' announcement as \"a significant one.\"Before the Year of Mercy, in dioceses in many parts of the world, special permission from a bishop was required to absolve the sin of abortion, he said.\"In the Year of Mercy, Pope Francis extended that permission to all priests for a year. Today he extended it indefinitely,\" he said.\"It's another gesture of mercy and welcome from a Pope whose hallmarks are mercy and welcome.\"Pope Francis has forged a more forgiving, merciful direction for the Church since his papacy began in March 2013, taking a more welcoming position toward groups that had previously found themselves on the margins of the Catholic establishment, such as gays and lesbians, and divorced Catholics.\"Overall he is trying to make it easier for people to be forgiven and feel forgiven,\" said Martin.READ MORE: How Pope Francis is shaking up the Vatican CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/europe/pope-francis-absolve-abortion/index.html"}

{"_id":"Popular heartburn medications linked to higher risk of stroke","articleText":" (CNN)Sometimes, solving one problem only creates another.Millions of Americans take proton pump inhibitors to treat acid reflux and heartburn. Known as PPIs, they are among the most prescribed drugs in the United States and are widely available over the counter.But according to preliminary research presented today at an American Heart Association conference in New Orleans, these medications may also increase the risk of ischemic stroke.Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They occur when a blood clot cuts off blood flow to the brain.\"PPIs have been associated with unhealthy vascular function, including heart attacks, kidney disease and dementia,\" said Dr. Thomas Sehested, the study's lead author and a researcher at the Danish Heart Foundation. \"We wanted to see if PPIs also posed a risk for ischemic stroke, especially given their increasing use in the general population.\"Most serious warning yetThe research was conducted in Denmark among a quarter-million patients who suffered from stomach pain and indigestion, and were taking one of four PPIs: Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid or Nexium.Overall stroke risk increased 21% among patients who were taking a PPI, according to the study. At the lowest doses, the authors found either no or minimal increased risk of stroke. At the highest doses, they found that stroke risk increased 33% for Prilosec and Prevacid patients, 50% for Nexium patients and 79% for Protonix patients.In an email to CNN, P&G, the company that makes Prilosec, said the drug is an \"FDA approved, safe and effective remedy to relieve frequent heartburn symptoms. Prilosec OTC has the longest history of safe and effective consumer use of any [over the counter] PPI.\"Takeda, the maker of Prevacid, said it could not comment on the results and conclusions of the study until the full data is published for review. \"Patient safety is a top priority ... and we continuously monitor the safety of all our medicines and collaborate with regulatory agencies to ensure this information is reflected in the respective prescribing information,\" a spokesman said in an email to CNN.AstraZeneca, the maker of Nexium, said, \"Patient safety is an important priority ... and we believe all of our PPI medicines are generally safe and effective when used in accordance with the label.\" A spokeswoman said the company was not consulted during the research, so it could not comment on the data.Pfizer, the maker of Protonix, did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\"At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,\" Sehested said. \"This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs.\"For years, doctors have questioned whether too many people are taking heartburn drugs.A pair of 2010 studies found that PPIs were associated with an increased risk of a serious bacterial infection. Stomach acid seems to play a role in killing off both good and bad bacteria in our gut. When someone is taking PPIs, their amount of stomach acid is reduced, and it creates an environment in which bacteria can flourish.\"As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol or not smoking,\" Dr. Michael Katz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the studies, told CNN in 2010.In April, another study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that patients who took PPIs had a 96% increased risk of kidney failure and a 28% increased risk of kidney disease, compared with those who were prescribed alternative medications.What are the alternatives?Medical professionals estimate that the majority of people who suffer from acid reflux or heartburn could drastically or completely reduce their discomfort by making a few lifestyle changes: quit smoking, lose weight and cut back on spicy and fatty foods.If your doctor determines that you do need pills for your problem, pharmacist NaaDede Badger-Plange suggests starting with an antacid, such as Tums, Rolaids or Maalox.\"Antacids usually would help if you have less than one incident a week,\" Badger-Plange said. \"So, if you have heartburn very rarely -- especially people who have heartburn associated with certain foods -- they could take antacids.\"Antacids provide quick relief, but only for a short amount of time, said Badger-Plange, and consumers should pay close attention to the ingredients on the label. If you're pregnant, you should avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium trisilicate. Patients with kidney disease should avoid antacids that contain aluminum.For longer-lasting relief, H2 antagonist medications (also called H2 blockers) are also an option, but they can take a few hours to kick in.\"One thing to keep in mind is, certain products that are in the H2 receptor antagonist class have drug interactions,\" Badger-Plange said. \"So, if you have a lot of medications, you probably want to check with your pharmacist at the counter to make sure it's OK to take those medications.\"As always, you should talk to your doctor before starting or stopping any medication -- prescribed or over the counter.For years, Katz has been worried that PPIs \"reinforce the idea that the solution to behavioral health issues is to take a pill, and that's just not how we're going to get healthier,\" he said in 2010. \"Consumers need to ask their doctors, 'Why am I taking this? Do I still need this? Do I have an alternative?' \"CNN's Tomeka Jones contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/health/heartburn-medication-stroke-risk/index.html"}

{"_id":"Practicing Islam in Catholic Cuba","articleText":" (CNN)Most of the images we see out of Cuba are similar -- classic cars here, vibrantly colored buildings there. But Joan Alvado shows us something different. His photo series, \"Cuban Muslims,\" focuses on the lives of those who have converted to Islam.\"When I learned there was Islam and a Muslim community, I really liked it because I never heard of it,\" Alvado said. \"It was breaking all the preconceived ideas that we have about Cuban society.\"An estimated 85% of Cubans are Catholic. But only 0.1% of the population -- just a few thousand people -- are Muslim, according to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center (PDF).Alvado says almost all of them are converts.\"That applies to absolutely everybody in (my photo) series,\" he said. \"Many of them were Christians before or some other religion, or a few of them were atheists as well.\"He says the reasons for conversion vary. While some people view Islam as \"a little bit more true or pure religion than others,\" there are those who turn to Islam for more personal and specific reasons. He provided the example of how Islam might be positive for those who have problems with alcohol, as Islam is a way for them to avoid alcohol. The Quran forbids the consumption of intoxicants and alcoholic beverages. There are challenges, though, that come with practicing Islam in a country where it's such a drastic minority. One of the main ones is finding a place to worship.\"The communities are being organized in very, very small groups, and someone in each group will offer their home on Fridays (to pray) or something like that,\" he said.Alvado says Cuban Muslims are constantly learning about their new religion and evolving together.\"Everyone is doing a little bit of their own interpretation on how to read (Islamic) rules and be with them, more or less, and that's interesting,\" he said.One of his photos, No. 11 in the gallery above, shows a woman struggling to put on an Islamic scarf.\"This woman had been Christian all her life, really a devoted Christian for many, many years of her life,\" he said. \"That's why, for me, (the photo series) is really speaking about identity and confusion.\"Alvado adds that this project was just as much of a learning experience for him.\"I have learned more things about Islam and Islamic beliefs and their ideas in Havana than working in Turkey,\" the Spanish photographer said.Cuba is a spiritual and passionate city, he said, especially when it comes to religion. In the beginning, he wasn't sure how people would react to him wanting to photograph their lives. Working to develop a mutual respect and being open about his intents from the outset -- such as by making sure his subjects knew he is atheist -- was a significant part of his work.Alvado says he will visit Cuba again later this year. When he told some of the people he photographed that he hopes to publish these images in a book one day, he says they reacted with excitement at the idea that other people would be able to see their experiences as Muslims in Cuba.\"I felt that they are wanting their story to be told, and it didn't happen before,\" Alvado said. \"To see that they have these expectations about what can come out of it, it made me have a reflection about myself. You also have some sort of responsibility towards them about what you are going to do with this.\"Joan Alvado is a documentary photographer based in Barcelona, Spain.

{"_id":"Prefabulous: How to set up home in the most remote places on Earth","articleText":" (CNN)If you're looking to hole up in the middle of nowhere, there's a hut in a box for that. Back in the days of gloom post World War Two, prefab homes -- structures prefabricated in sections in a factory and then assembled on site -- were built en masse as temporary solutions for those who had been \"bombed out\".Just over 70 years later, prefab houses are still considered affordable alternatives to building homes from scratch.Prefab pioneer Jean Prouvé designed his \"demountable house\" in the 1940s as a potential solution for the housing crisis in France. These inexpensive homes were rapidly built from steel and wood, assembled by hand, and supported by a two-legged load-bearing structure.Today prefabricated buildings are used as temporary relief for those who have lost their homes to natural disasters, refugees, as well as a quick fix for housing crises.But prefab is increasingly becoming an attractive option for constructing everything from cabins in the wilderness to high-end designer homes for city slickers.One Canadian company has even gone as far as creating DIY cabins which come straight out of the box, complete with step-by-step instructions on how to assemble them.Hut-in-a-boxBackcountry Hut Company grew from a need for recreational refuge points for outdoorsy folk in remote locations.Avid backcountry adventurer, Wilson Edgar, dreamt up the idea of customizable huts that could be easily pieced together on-site by a group of people.\"When someone  takes a house project today they basically give up control as soon as they start the project,\" Edgar tells CNN. \"This is putting that control back in their hands.\"Edgar teamed up with Principal Architect of Leckie Studio Architecture + Design, Michael Leckie, to tackle the design.The huts come in two distinct styles -- backcountry and frontcountry -- each with multiple configurations. The base model is a studio loft measuring 191 square feet, with a kitchen and living area on the ground level and sleeping quarters for two to four people on the top floor. However, modules can be combined and the hut can be extended to fit up to 30 people.\"One of the values in the system is that it is scalable and mass customizable,\" explains Leckie, referring to various interior fitout options and exterior finishes.This, according to Leckie, is one of the key differences between their huts and other \"more rigid\" cabins.  Another is the ease with which it can be assembled.\"The building components are designed to such a size that they can be lifted by two people and put into place similar to almost like lego blocks,\" says Leckie.This is not to say the \"kit of parts\" can be slung over your shoulder like a sack of tent poles. In fact, the pre-module shell, timber frame skeleton, window system, doors, cladding, and interior fitouts arrive in a 40-foot shipping container and need to be lifted by helicopter to locations inaccessible by roads.While the hut's structural components cost $150 dollars a square foot, the interior fitouts can add a significant amount, depending on the client's taste.Is prefab the answer?Prefab homes are often considered to cut the spiralling costs of building a home, as well as the time it takes to build.\"For the average person building a custom home there are so many unknowns, and I think that a lot of people really struggle with the perceived lack of control through the process,\" says Leckie.\"What we have here is a product that comes ultimately delivered, it's a fixed-price solution.\"However, architect Charlie Lazor of Lazor Office -- a design firm that specializes in the design and prefabrication of dwellings -- is of the opinion that prefab isn't always the answer.\"There is a perception that prefab will solve the problem of the cost of a home,\" Lazor tells CNN.\"There are benefits to be had, and more benefits if the stars align, but it's not a silver bullet, and it's not going to solve a budget deficit.\"In 2005 the Minneapolis-based architect first introduced his panelized FlatPak house -- a pre-fabricated, configurable house system.Having designed and built many modular, FlatPak and stick built homes over the years, Lazor explains that there are multiple ways to do prefabrication.

{"_id":"Prescription heroin gets green light in Canada ","articleText":" (CNN)Health Canada has amended its regulations to allow Canadian doctors to prescribe heroin as a treatment for those who are severely addicted to the drug. Last week's change to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act permits doctors to apply for permission under the federal Special Access Program to offer their addicted patients diacetylmorphine: pharmaceutical-grade heroin.The government referred to a \"medical need for emergency access to diacetylmorphine\" in the regulation. \"A number of countries have allowed doctors to use diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment to support the small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatment options,\" the regulation states. \"There is also a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its use.\"The new rule reinstates an old one, explained Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, an associate professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia. In October 2013, then-Health Minister Rona Ambrose removed diacetylmorphine from the federal Special Access Program and so banned doctors' access to prescription heroin. The new regulation clarifies that heroin can be prescribed to patients only under supervision in specialized circumstances, said Oviedo-Joekes: \"They made it a bit more clear how this request should be handled.\"Oviedo-Joekes led the North American Opiate Medication Initiative, an experimental drug trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment in a Canadian context. The study, which is referred to in the new regulation, examined heroin as a treatment for severe addicts in British Columbia and found a higher percentage of female users and a significantly higher prevalence of crack use than in European settings. The authors noted that cocaine addiction jeopardizes the possible results in opioid addiction treatment.Of course, not all Canadians believe that treating addiction with heroin is a move in the right direction. Ambrose told GlobalNews.ca in 2013 that giving addicts heroin is \"not to treat an underlying medical condition, but simply to allow them to continue to have access to heroin for their addiction even though other safe treatments for heroin addiction, such as methadone, are available.\"According to Oviedo-Joekes, \"methadone doesn't work all the time for everybody. Methadone works very well as a first-line treatment.\" Addiction, \"like any other illness,\" may require second-line or even third-line treatments.  Prescribing heroin to severe addicts who don't respond to other treatments may not cure them of their habit, according to Oviedo-Joekes and her colleagues, but it can lessen their exposure to life-threatening health risks, such as drug overdoses, blood-borne viral infections and endocarditis, an inflammation of the chambers of the heart. Studies indicate that prescription heroin reduces illicit drug use and so decreases criminal activity and health care costs, so the greater societal toll is lessened.This fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government will sponsor a summit to address the issue of opioid addiction, Health Minister Jane Philpott told 660 News.  According to Oviedo-Joekes, opioid deaths in Canada are on the rise. Not all provinces keep count, she said, but the numbers in British Columbia are more than double last year's figures.\"In British Columbia, the last [death] count was beyond 400 people, and it is estimated by the end of the year we will reach 800 deaths due to fentanyl,\" Oviedo-Joekes said, citing a coroner's statistics. Fentanyl, a type of opioid, is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin.The crux of the problem is that addicts don't know they are buying fentanyl; they believe they are buying heroin or other opioids.  Because fentanyl is so potent, it's easier for drug dealers to make more money with it, so they cut heroin with it, Oviedo-Joekes explained.\"There are going to be other drugs beside fentanyl,\" she said, noting that drug dealers will find a way to increase their profits: \"They'll always be a couple of steps ahead of us.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/prescription-heroin-canada/index.html"}

In an interview Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper, Reince Priebus, currently the Republican National Committee chairman, noted that Trump did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement announced Friday. \"When the presidency hits you, and it's at your front door and you realize that you are president of the United States for all Americans, there are some things that are important to you and some things that you decide,\" Priebus said. \"Look, let's move on, we're not admitting wrongdoing, and let's just start leading this country without distraction.  \"That's what you're seeing, and I think Americans should look at this as a real positive sign about what kind of great president he is going to be and how he wants to lead this country.\"The settlement ended a suit brought by the New York attorney general as well as two class-action suits in California over Trump University. The cases alleged Trump defrauded people who enrolled in real estate seminars he started in 2005.'Potential conflicts of interest?'In Sunday's interview, Priebus said Americans shouldn't be concerned with potential pay-to-play schemes in a Trump administration despite reports that Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who helms part of the family's business portfolio, has sat in on some of Trump's early meetings with foreign leaders. \"We've been at this for a few days. I mean, this is ridiculous. Let's just kind of take a deep breath. The point is, what Americans should see from President-elect Trump is someone who, by being in action from the moment he was declared the winner, he was on a mission to bring everyone together,\" Priebus said. \"That, to me, is what we should be celebrating. I think people should be encouraged by what they see. And I think it's a real positive sign for the future of our country.\" Tapper pressed Priebus on the topic, asking: \"As White House chief of staff, you're supposed to look out for any political or ethical minefields. Is it seriously the position of the Trump transition team that this is not a huge cauldron of potential conflicts of interest?\"And Priebus said: \"Obviously we will comply with all of those laws, and we will have our White House counsel review all of these things. We will have every 'i' dotted and every 't' crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldn't be any wrongdoing or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making.\"And he defended Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, against accusations of racist conduct early in his career. Allegations of racially charged comments cost Sessions a job as a federal judge in 1986. Priebus said Sessions \"started his career fighting George Wallace.\" \"He voted for (former Attorney General) Eric Holder. He fought for a congressional gold medal for Rosa Parks,\" Priebus said. \"This is an honorable, decent, good human being that we're talking about.\"'Sanctuary cities,' immigrationPriebus also suggested the Trump White House could seek to block federal dollars from flowing to \"sanctuary cities\" that don't enforce immigration laws. In recent years, local governments across the country fought back against federal immigration enforcement by calling themselves sanctuary cities. Trump made them a focus on the campaign trail, pledging to block funding for cities that take that tack.\"The idea that a city would decide to ignore federal law and then would want the federal government to help them anyway is an inconsistent position for those local governments to continue to engage in,\" Priebus said. \"And so, I think this is a matter of negotiation ... but certainly I can't imagine that too many Americans are watching this and thinking that it's a good idea for a city to allow for blanket amnesty, ignoring federal law, and then say, 'Now give me $500 million,' \" he said. \"No, that's not the way life works. And I think that a Trump administration is going to explore this issue and, I think, resolve some of these major problems that are happening all across the country.\" Trump has also pledged to reverse President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration -- throwing into question the legal status of so-called Dreamers who were brought into the United States as children. Priebus deflected a question on the status of those people, saying Trump would focus on border security and the deportation of those who have committed crimes first. Further immigration policy decisions are \"a subject that's going to come up after those first two things are taken care of,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/reince-priebus-trump-university/index.html"}

Obama also stressed following both the letter and spirit of the law and repeated that he is \"extremely proud\" of fact that over eight years his administration hasn't had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other administrations. Obama also said he advised President-elect Trump to make sure he had a strong counsel's office to avoid ethical controversies.\"When I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House counsel that could provide clear guide posts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity,\" he told reporters. \"I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it.\"CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/politics/trump-business-conflicts-reince-priebus/index.html"}
{"_id":"Pulling children out of Nepal's prisons","articleText":"Pushpa Basnet was named the CNN Hero of the Year in 2012. She used the award money toward achieving her dream: building a permanent residence -- also called \"Butterfly Home\" -- for the children in her care. While under construction, the home was damaged by the 2015 earthquake that struck Nepal. Basnet rebuilt it and opened the new \"Butterfly Home\" in May. Kathmandu, Nepal  (CNN)Pushpa Basnet doesn't need an alarm clock. Every morning, the sound of 40 children wakes her up in the two-story rental home she shares with them. As she helps the children dress for school, Basnet might appear to be a housemother of sorts. But the real story is more complicated. All of these children once lived in Nepal's prisons. This 28-year-old woman has saved every one of them from a life behind bars.Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world -- according to UNICEF, 55% of the population lives below the international poverty line -- so it lacks the social safety net that exists in most Western nations. Space is extremely limited in the few children's homes affiliated with the government.So when no local guardian is available, an arrested parent often must choose between bringing their children to jail with them or letting them live on the streets. Nepal's Department of Prison Management estimates 80 children live in the nation's prisons. \"It's not fair for (these) children to live in the prison because they haven't done anything wrong,\" said Basnet, who started a nongovernmental organization to help. \"My mission is to make sure no child grows up behind prison walls.\"Basnet is one of several in Nepal who have started groups to get children out of prison. Since 2005, she has assisted more than 100 children of incarcerated parents. She runs a day care program for children under 6 and a residential home where mostly older children receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life.\"I had a very fortunate life, with a good education,\" Basnet said. \"I should give it to somebody else.\"Basnet was just 21 when she discovered her calling, she said. While her family ran a successful business, she was studying social work in college. As part of her studies, she visited a women's prison and was appalled by the dire conditions. She also was shocked to discover children living behind bars. One baby girl grabbed Basnet's shawl and gave her a big smile.  \"I felt she was calling me,\" Basnet said. \"I went back home and told my parents about it. They told me it was a normal thing and that in a couple of days I'd forget it. But I couldn't forget.\"From behind barsWhen Basnet decided to start a day care to get incarcerated children out from behind the prison walls, her parents were against the idea at first -- she had no job or way to sustain it financially. Eventually, they helped support her. But prison officials, government workers and even some of the imprisoned mothers she approached doubted that someone her age could handle such a project.\"When I started, nobody believed in me,\" Basnet said. \"People thought I was crazy. They laughed at me.\"But Basnet was undaunted. She got friends to donate money, and she rented a building in Kathmandu to house her new organization, the Early Childhood Development Center. She furnished it largely by convincing her parents that they needed a new refrigerator or kitchen table; when her parents' replacement would arrive, she'd whisk the old one to her center.Just two months after she first visited the prison, Basnet began to care for five children. She picked them up at the prison every weekday morning, brought them to her center and then returned them in the afternoon. Basnet's program was the first of its kind in Kathmandu; when she started, some of the children in her care had never been outside a prison.Two years later, Basnet established the Butterfly Home, a children's home where she herself has lived for the past five years. While she now has a few staff members who help her, Basnet is still very hands on.\"We do cooking, washing, shopping,\" she said. \"It's amazing, I never get tired. (The children) give me the energy. ... The smiles of my children keep me motivated.\"Butterfly sanctuary  Coordinating all of this is no easy task. But at the Butterfly Home, the older kids help care for the younger ones and everyone pitches in with household chores. The atmosphere feels like an extremely large family, a feeling that's fostered by Basnet, who smothers the children with love. The children reciprocate by calling her \"Mamu,\" which means \"Mommy.\"   \"I don't ever get a day off, but if I [didn't] have the children around me, it would be hard,\" she said. \"When I'm with them, I'm happy.\"All the children are at the Butterfly Home with the consent of the imprisoned parent. When Basnet hears about an imprisoned child, she'll visit the prison -- even in remote areas of the country -- and tell the parent what she can provide. If the parent agrees, Basnet brings the child back. She is still eager, however, for the children to maintain relationships with their parents. During school holidays, she sends the younger children to the prisons to visit, and she brings them food, clothing and fresh water during their stay. Ultimately, Basnet wants the families to reunite outside prison, and 60 of her children have been able to do just that.Parents like Kum Maya Tamang are grateful for Basnet's efforts. Tamang has spent the last seven years in a women's prison in Kathmandu. When she was convicted on drug charges, she had no other options for child care, so she brought her two daughters to jail with her. When she heard about Basnet's program, she decided to let them go live with her. \"If Pushpa wasn't around, (they) could have never gotten an education ... (they) would have probably had to live on the streets,\" she said. \"I feel she treats (them) the way I would.\"Tamang's oldest daughter, Laxmi, said she can't imagine life without Basnet.  \"My life would have been dark without her,\" said Laxmi, 14. \"I would've probably always had a sad life. But now I won't, because of Pushpa.\"In 2009, Basnet started a program to teach the parents how to make handicrafts, which she sells to raise money for the children's care. Both mothers and fathers participate. It not only gives them skills that might help them  support themselves when they're released, but it also helps them feel connected to their children.  \"Often, they think that they're useless because they're in prison,\" Basnet said. \"I want to make them feel that they are contributing back to us.\"Making ends meet is always a struggle, though. The children help by making greeting cards that Basnet sells as part of her handicraft business. In the past, she has sold her own jewelry and possessions to keep the center going. Her biggest concern is trying to find ways to do more to give the children a better future. She recently set up a bank account to save for their higher educations, and one day she hopes to buy or build a house so they'll always have a place to call home. Their happiness is always foremost in her thoughts.\"This is what I want to do with my life,\" she said. \"It makes me feel (good) when I see that they are happy, but it makes me want to work harder. ... I want to fulfill all their dreams.\"Want to get involved?

{"_id":"Rabbi Lila Kagedan: A history-making title in Orthodox Judaism","articleText":"Randolph, New Jersey (CNN)Ten young children sit around a table as Lila Kagedan walks into their synagogue's after-school program. Paper plates filled with art supplies are waiting for them to tear into. Kagedan introduces herself as the new rabbi at their synagogue. Not one of the elementary-school-aged children seems surprised. But her announcement is surprising -- historic, even: Kagedan, of Mount Freedom Jewish Center, is the first woman to have the title of rabbi serving an Orthodox congregation. It is a job she has dreamed of holding since she was a little girl, but rabbinical school did not exist for women in the Orthodox movement for most of her life. \"Growing up the only model of rabbi in the Orthodox world were men,\" Kagedan says. \"So in some ways this really didn't feel like an option.\"Calling herself 'Rabbi Kagedan'Kagedan, 35, grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Montreal. Her father, who passed away two years ago, was her \"greatest teacher,\" studying Jewish texts with her on most nights and urging her to follow her dream.  \"I wouldn't say that he told me that there were no barriers -- I would say that he had no idea how this would come about,\" Kagedan says. \"His message to me was to arm myself with the rabbinate texts, to know them intimately. But he cautioned me not to be angry. And if I was feeling angry about exclusion to take that anger and do something very productive with it.\"Kagedan spent years studying bioethics around the world, but always continued studying Jewish texts with the hope that she could one day attend rabbinical school. And then, in 2009, a school called Yeshivat Maharat opened with the hope of helping women achieve leadership positions in the Orthodox Jewish community. Kagedan graduated in its third class. There have been Orthodox Jewish women before her who took the title \"rabba,\" but Kagedan was firm in wanting to be called Rabbi Kagedan. \"I knew that I wanted my title to be the most accurate description of my training,\" Kagedan says. \"I didn't want to walk into a room or a space and have there be any ambiguity of what it is that I was there to do. What my training was. What my skill set was.\"The idea of a female rabbi is not accepted by everyone in Orthodox Judaism. The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), an organization made up of Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution in October 2015 in response to Kagedan's school, Yeshivat Maharat, ordaining women as rabbis, calling it \"a violation of our mesorah [tradition]\" and saying the school's decision to do so was \"a path that contradicts the norms of our community.\" When asked about Kagedan's new position, Rabbi Mark Dratch, the RCA's executive vice president, said the organization \"encourages a diversity of [sanctioned] and communally appropriate opportunities for learned, committed women,\" but it does not accept the ordination or recognition of women as Orthodox rabbis. Kagedan says she is a product of RCA education and that her greatest teachers were part of the organization. But, she hopes the group will come around to the idea of women leading congregations.\"Women need to see other women in these leadership positions to keep them motivated in their Judaism, to have leaders that they can relate to, that they can feel comfortable with in different ways that they might not feel comfortable with their male leadership,\" Kagedan says. \"I guarantee you only positive outcomes will emerge from having men and women working in the rabbinate and being accessible to the community.\"Kagedan says she has been warmly welcomed by members of the Mount Freedom Jewish Center, about an hour outside of New York City, where her primary focus will be teaching. She sees herself as a rabbi there to serve both men and women, but understands why her position is so important to women in her congregation.\"I hope to normalize women in leadership roles,\" she says. \"When I look out at the community and I see  ...  young girls, I hope that they get a sense that anything is possible. That nothing is out of their reach. And that it might be a tremendous struggle and it might come with tremendous sadness and frustration but that if they want something badly enough it's their responsibility to create a mood where this can come about.\"Bigger than just her Kagedan's life is delicate balancing act between upholding Orthodox Jewish traditions that are dear to her, and pushing her own boundaries in this new role. Being a female rabbi has its range of challenges in an Orthodox setting -- even where to stand.In Orthodox synagogues, men and women sit separately in the sanctuary when they pray, with a divider separating them. At Mount Freedom Jewish Center, men sit on the right side of the room, and women sit on the left. The rabbi stands on the right. Kagedan discussed this with Rabbi Menashe East, who hired her at the synagogue. Where could she stand when giving a sermon to the congregation? They chatted for a few minutes about how to simultaneously embrace her monumental new role while respecting the rules and traditions of the religion their ancestors have preserved for centuries. The impact of Kagedan's appointment at the beginning of 2016 is already being felt. A month or so after East introduced her to the congregation, he asked his eldest daughter what she wants to be when she grows up.\"'Maybe I'll be a rabbi,'\" East recalls her saying. \"''Yeah, I could be like Rabbi Lila.'\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/living/first-orthodox-woman-rabbi-feat/index.html"}

{"_id":"Raising a good person in a digital world","articleText":"As parents, we have many hopes for our kids. We want them to grow up to live happy, successful lives. We hope they'll find love, maybe have kids of their own, and pursue their dreams. But at the bottom of all these wishes is the hope that our kid turns into a decent human being -- someone who is kind, respectful, and honest.How do you bolster these strengths as well as teach key skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance? For the most part, kids will learn these things by following your example and through experience gained at school and in their communities. But media is another entry point. Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids' lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.100+ ways to help kids learn grit, determination and resilienceHere are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:Watch sports.Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don't get all the attention, the team wouldn't be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.How movies can build kids' character -- and the ones that do it wellShare social media.From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression. Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.Expand your horizons.Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary -- a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that's less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours -- and encourage discussion afterward.Play video games together.Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try \"I need help over here\" instead of \"you idiot!\"). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.Can TV and games teach kids patience and empathy?Take a time-out.Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it's nothing urgent), say out loud, \"I don't need to check that right now.\" This lesson can work on social media, too. If you're a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don't want to respond right away (\"I might say something I regret because I'm upset\" or \"I'd rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter\").","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/kids-character-digital-world/index.html"}
{"_id":"Raising spoiled kids? How to set limits ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)More than 10 years ago, as I headed to one of my final OB/GYN appointments before my first daughter was born, I had a moment.I saw a young girl -- she couldn't have been older than 12 -- walking down the street with a large Pucci shopping bag, talking so rudely to her mother.I cringed and thought, \"What a spoiled brat,\" and told myself I would do everything to make sure that I did not raise spoiled children.Fast-forward 10 years, and there is very little chance that my sports-loving, T-shirt-wearing girls will ever be caught dead shopping in Pucci, so I don't have to worry about that. Still, my children have so much more than I ever had when I was their age, and I admit I sometimes break down when they want something and plead over and over again, \"Please, please, can I have this?\"I know I'm not alone.In the third installment of our new CNN Digital Video series \"Parent Acts,\" we asked parents to act out why it's so hard to say no to our kids when they want something, and then we had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.\"I feel like my children are never satisfied and happy with what they have, so that's really, I think, that's my issue,\" said Laura Simms, a mom of three in Atlanta and owner of a public relations firm.Tricia Ferrara is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. \"In a changing world, raising your child to think they must be statically happy is not helpful,\" said Ferrara, author of \"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\" a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. \"Children need a process for coping with and adapting to a changing environment. It's up to us, as parents, to give them that process.\"As parents, Ferrara says, we want our kids to look at the world and think, \"I want more,\" but we want them to be able to do that in such a way that they realize that getting what they want is a result of their efforts and not from \"poking at somebody else.\"\"Just folding and giving your children just what they want is not helpful for them over the long run,\" Ferrara said. \"I know for parents, sometimes it's easier for them ... but easy for you is not healthy for them. So teaching them or compelling them how to organize their energy toward a goal is critical. It's a critical skill for now, but it's a very critical skill for the future.\"When your child sees the ice cream truck and screams, \"Please, Mommy, you never let me get Mister Softee,\" instead of  breaking down and getting your child that ice cream, you could proactively offer your child ice cream -- but only after they show \"big-kid behavior.\"For many little kids, the No. 1 thing they want is to feel like they're growing up, said Ferrara, a mom of two teenagers. \"So incentivizing them to do behaviors that show they're a big kid will get them the big-kid goodies.\"Why 'spoiled' is a sensitive word for parents Most parents will admit that the single worst word that someone could use to describe their children -- the word that would feel like the biggest indictment of their parenting -- would be to call them \"spoiled,\" said Ron Lieber, author of \"The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money.\"But before parents can know how not to raise spoiled children, it helps to know a little bit more about the qualities that make them spoiled, said Lieber, who writes the \"Your Money\" column for the New York Times.He says spoiled kids have absolutely no rules, so they can do as they please without facing any consequences. Or if their parents set rules about behavior or what they can do, they don't face any consequences when they break those rules.Spoiled kids have helicopter parents who do too much for their kids and smooth the way so there is no chance of them ever failing, said Lieber. And finally, spoiled kids, in most instances, do or have things that many other kids do not get to do or have, and they show no appreciation for those things.\"If spoil is something that (parents) do to them and it's not an attitude that they pick up elsewhere, then we really have to check our instincts, particularly if we are lucky enough to give kids not just what they need but much of what they want,\" said Lieber, who has two daughters, ages 10 months and 10.The key, he said, is setting boundaries for our kids. \"The question that I would ask every parent to think about is how can I set limits for my child, whether it's a 6-year-old or a 12-year-old or an 18-year-old, and these might even be artificial limits, but how can I set limits such that my child will have the maximum amount of control over these intense material desires that many of them have?\" he said.Teaching tradeoffsOne way of doing that, when kids are young, say 6 or 7, is to give them a weekly allowance unrelated to chores. As kids get older, you can give them control over their annual budget for clothing or extracurricular activities, he said.Once we, as parents, set caps on how much money they have to work with, giving them enough money to have the power and authority to get some of what they want but not so much that they don't have to make hard choices, they naturally learn that they need to make tradeoffs, just like adults have to do every day. \"When we set those limits and we set those caps, then decisions are up to them, and they're making the tradeoffs, and they're beginning to understand the concept of limits,\" Lieber said. \"And once there are limits and they are pretty carefully enforced, it's pretty hard for a kid to end up spoiled if those are the constraints that they are living under.\"What's important to remember, he said, is that just because a child wants three American Girl dolls or to have a BMW as their first car or to live in a mansion when they grow up, as my girls say they want to do, it doesn't mean they are spoiled. We all want things we can't afford. I would love a beach house, but that just isn't in the cards right now.\"There is nothing wrong with that. We live in a consumer culture,\" Lieber said. \"The question is, how are we going to give them the power to make their own choices?\"Giving them the power means an end to a child saying, \"Please, please, Mommy, can I have that?\"What I want every parent is not to ever be in a situation where they're the ones answering that question,\" Lieber said. \"They should be in a situation where the kids are finding ways to answer those questions for themselves.\"Do you worry about raising spoiled children?

{"_id":"Rare Patek Phillipe wristwatch sells for $11 million, breaks auction records","articleText":" (CNN)A rare, stainless steel Patek Philippe Reference 1518 wristwatch sold for just over $11 million at the weekend (CHF 11,002,000), making it the most expensive wristwatch ever to be sold at auction.  The price was reached after a 13 minute bidding war at the Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo Geneva Watch Auction: FOUR sale in Geneva, Switzerland and was more than triple the initial pre-sale estimate.\"One thing that is fascinating about this sale is that there were eight bidders bidding for this watch and it wasn't until the price reached CHF 7 million that two remaining buyers started to battle to secure the sale,\" said Sam Hines, the international head of watches at Phillips auction house. \"This watch really ticked every box the trophy collectors are looking for. It was fresh to the market, there are only four known examples and it was in perfect condition,\" he says. Hines added that the buyer of the record-breaking watch wished to remain anonymous. The 'Rolls-Royce' of watchesThe Patek Philippe Reference 1518 perpetual calendar chronograph wristwatch was made in 1943, and includes features such as a moonphase indicator, Arabic hour markers and a tachymeter scale. Prior to this sale, the most expensive watch ever to have sold at auction was also from Patek Philippe -- a Reference 5016 in stainless steel -- which sold at a Phillips auction last year for more than $7.3 million (CHF 7.3 million), according to Hines. \"I think Patek Philippe is considered a blue chip brand and one of the most important watch makers in the world. They have had uninterrupted production since 1839, they make very few watches every year, and it's just considered the very best, like a Rolls-Royce,\" he said. \"It shows the recent growth of the watch market, and also has to do with the growth of the trophy market over the last year or so where people want the very best in terms of quality and condition and are willing to pay the very best to secure it.\"The results of the sale reflected this demand, and the British auction house sold a total of 177 watches at the auction and realized nearly $27.8 million (CHF 27,514,625).

{"_id":"Read his lips: Trump won't change as president","articleText":"David A. Andelman is editor emeritus of World Policy Journal and member of the board of contributors of USA Today. The opinions in this article belong to the author (CNN)There's still a small, increasingly fading hope in the United States -- and indeed much of the world observing our \"transition process\" -- that Donald Trump will suddenly transform through some magical wizardry into a more or less conventional president of the type we've seen in the 44 previous holders of that office.But if you believe that's going to happen, you haven't been listening to his every utterance for the past 18 months. As president #41, the now-beloved George H.W. Bush put it so memorably in the line written by the incomparable Peggy Noonan: \"Read my lips.\" Of course he was referring to the second half of that memorable phrase, namely, \"no new taxes.\"That was 1988. By 1990, a Democratic Congress had pushed through any number of new taxes to cut the budget deficit, which Bush had to sign. Of course Bill Clinton brought that up in his run for the presidency two years later, and Bush became a one-term president. There are several big differences today, however.First, Trump has a Republican Congress that seems poised to slavishly ratify even the wackiest ideas and appointments. But second and most important, Donald Trump doesn't seem to care very much at all what people say or think. He just plans to continue being The Donald.So the world needs to quickly get back to lip reading. It also needs to recall every specific thing that Donald Trump says. Because he certainly seems to remember what the world has been saying about him.Take his latest rounds with the media. First, he summoned the entire leadership of America's television news juggernauts to his Trump Tower aerie in New York for what his mouthpiece, Kelleyanne Conway called a \"fence-mending session,\" then launched into a lengthy harangue about how bad a job they were doing covering him -- and incidentally using most unflattering images. Oh and his strict off-the-record ground rules meant no one could report on any of this. Apparently @realdonaldtrump still hasn't learned that there's no off-the-record with more than two people in the room, let alone scores of journos and their bosses.But then we woke up on Tuesday and there was more. This time it was the print press -- the granddaddy of them all -- the august New York Times. The paper thought it had an off-the-record, then on-the-record sit-down interview with the President-elect in Trump Tower. At least that's what the paper put out at 6:30 in the morning. Then, minutes later came Trump's riposte: \"I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice.\" Nice. Clearly The Times hadn't been reading its own clips. Two hours later, it was back on—Trump now agreeing to travel to the paper 20 blocks from Trump Tower to make it happen. It's all part of the whiplash that's this presidential transition.But all this only scratches the surface, as Trump himself even suggests in his endless succession of tweets, which for the moment we will have to settle for in lieu of a press conference or even an on-the-record interview.Indeed, President-elect Trump seemingly wants to dominate and control his own narrative. After kicking media leaders figuratively down the stairs of Trump Tower on Monday, he promptly released his own taped vision of his first 100 days (no questioners, no questions), then promptly tweeted that Nigel Farage, Britain's Mr. Brexit, would make a great UK ambassador to the Trump court. Despite British Prime Minister Theresa May pointing out that Downing Street names its own ambassadors, Boris Johnson, the UK's Foreign Secretary, was asked questions about Trump's suggestion Tuesday in the Houses of Parliament, and it has continued to be discussed as a serious option on UK media.And the beat goes on. Yes, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is dead -- at least to Trump. On his vast financial interests that everyone is waiting for him to divest -- as have 44 of his predecessors -- he tweeted, \"Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!\" Yes, the still-crooked media.So when nations gathered in Morocco for the COP22 environmental conference last week, hoping to move to the next step in climate modification before the world drowns in melting ice, it would be good for them to take seriously the words of candidate Trump -- global warming denier then and now. And when European leaders gather Thursday with Ukraine's president to explore that nation's growing separation from Vladimir Putin's Russia, they might listen to the drumbeat of praise for the Russian demagogue from his American counterpart that marked much of the political campaign season in the United States.Yes, we would do well to heed Peggy Noonan's words and read Donald Trump's lips -- and his tweets, a medium unavailable to Bush 41.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/opinions/trump-not-pivot-andelman-opinion/index.html"}
{"_id":"Recent grad: 'Leaning In' helped me land my first job","articleText":"Sheryl Sandberg wants young girls to \"ban bossy,\" but for those of us soon-to-graduate, just-graduated and will-I-ever-graduate ladies just entering the working world, there's another word that's even more toxic.That word is \"pushy.\"At least, that's what my Lean In Circle thinks. A new book by Sandberg, \"Lean In: For Graduates,\" targets women like us, but we were already paying attention. My Circle is all 20-somethings with dreams of media industry success. We wanted our group to exist as a third-wave feminist answer to boys clubs, with their oak-paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke. We share job announcements, work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks. A guy recently asked me, \"Lean In Circle -- is that, like, a book club?\" Sort of. Not quite. According to Sandberg's Lean In Foundation, 14,000 Lean In Circles meet regularly around the globe, and we don't just reread \"Lean In\" over mimosas. Lean In Circles were conceived as \"small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust.\" The Washington Post described the ethos as \"Alcoholics Anonymous fused with Girl Scouts,\" and I have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular Circle environment. And so we formed, and rallied around our Circle mission: to sit at the table and push back against \"pushy\" to find our first jobs.'Wait your turn'My mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice: Wait your turn, don't be pushy.But when I was 22, still in college, interning at a magazine in New York City and illegally subletting a run-down room, that advice just wasn't cutting it anymore. I was one semester away from graduation and the real world, and I was dreading it. One of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague: \"This is Julia Carpenter, and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job.\" It was true. Many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy, and unequivocally, they were miserable. Many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like New York or San Francisco and waited months for a job. Some worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away. When I was reading \"Lean In\" within the mouse-ridden confines of my apartment, Sandberg's words stoked the long-squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals. As an English major and a journalism student, many of the feminist tenets in \"Lean In\" weren't new to me, but they also weren't applicable to me yet. She urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership, not a trade-off. Many of her stories about the intersection of family planning, motherhood and careerdom didn't have much of an effect. Those were things I'd been reading about in women's studies textbooks for years, examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back. What was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts. For every lesson, Sandberg had a story to share about boardroom drama at Facebook, Google and elsewhere. In my young life, I hadn't had any Peggy Olson moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom.Instead, Sandberg's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion, of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women's success. I had been passed on for projects because of reasons like \"Why would a girl be interested in politics?\" and the word \"bitch\" had been thrown at me to end a conversation. Sandberg's examples provided simple solutions: Speak with purpose. Sit at the table.Sandberg writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace. In my case, it was in the world of job hunting. We fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as \"pushy.\" No one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she's trying to get a job.I realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that I wanted was even scarier than not having a job. I feared that I would be waiting in the wings, clutching my pages-long résumé and feeling insecure, as droves of confident, talented men dared to sit at the table.I knew to get that dream job, I was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys, just as Sandberg wrote.'Is there a job there for me?'Closing that confidence gap isn't easy, especially after a lifetime of \"Wait your turn.\" I read that when Sandberg was job hunting -- honestly, more like \"job picking\"  -- then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave her some invaluable advice, which ultimately became my guidepost.   \"Only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth.\"In my own job hunt, in the midst of interviewing and applying, I found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to: \"Did they even get my application?\" \"Oh my God, they hated my application\" and of course, \"Why did I even send in an application, I suck.\" On the other hand, men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications.\"I've been really forward (almost to the point of being pushy?) in the last year,\" a member of our Lean In Circle told me. \"But the only consequence there might've been for that is not getting a response to an application.\" Not all of Sandberg's advice resonated with my Circle. Business cards and job titles don't mean much to us, and unlike many of Sandberg's contemporaries, we've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism.\"A lot of my job search happened over beers, over shared criticisms, over social media interactions,\" said one member of my Circle. \"If I said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book, the person I was talking to would think I was a robot.When members of my Circle discuss job prospects -- which we're doing ever-more-frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask isn't \"What's the position?\" Instead, it's \"What would you be doing?\" The day before I graduated from college, I received a job offer from the magazine where I had interned while reading \"Lean In.\" The job was awesome. I would be living in a city I loved, working with amazing people and doing something I knew I was good at. But my heart was still set on another opportunity. A member of my Circle had referred me for a sweet spot on the Washington Post's digital engagement team, but after a few rounds of interviews I was still waiting for an answer.  \"You just have to wait,\" people told me. My newly Sheryl-fied inner voice said otherwise.  I called and explained the situation. \"Is there a job there for me?\" I remember saying.\"We were going to offer you the job tomorrow,\" my now-boss said. \"So -- what are you thinking?\" 'That's my girl'At a recent brunch with a college friend, she told me she's happy at her job, but looking for the next step, hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills.\"I want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings,\" she said. \"But I don't want to. I don't want to impose. They're going to be like 'Who is this girl? Why is she e-mailing me?' And I know my male colleagues wouldn't think twice. They'd send that e-mail.\" I immediately made a mental note to add her to our Circle.I know my Circle members would say it's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace, and you have to lean in bit by bit. They're right. If anything else, you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women, even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly. So even when I couldn't find a connection with Sandberg's discussion of work-life balance and motherhood or the buttoned-up culture of top tech executives, \"Lean In\" can't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women. For me and my Circle -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- Sandberg's simple suggestion to proceed boldly, empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions. We're wary of the gender gap not just in salary, but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices.  Even in the early days of a new gig, we're committed to closing that confidence (and achievement) gap. That's something we can take away from the pages. That's why a Circle is more than just a book club. In the middle of a conference call at work last week, I jumped into the conversation. \"I can explain this,\" I said, and launched into a short description of a project my team and I had been rolling out.\"When you said 'I can explain this,' you actually leaned in,\" a female colleague said to me afterward. \"You physically leaned in closer to the desk. I was like, 'That's my girl.'\"How did you land your first job?

{"_id":"Refugee kids find hope on the soccer field and in the classroom","articleText":"Clarkston, GA (CNN)A wrong turn changed Luma Mufleh's life.\"I was taking a drive to Clarkston, Georgia, to visit a Middle Eastern grocery store,\" she said. \"On my way home, I missed my turn, and I had to turn into this apartment complex. I saw these kids outside playing soccer. They were playing in the streets with blocks set up as goals and barefoot with a raggedy soccer ball. It reminded me of how I grew up playing soccer in the streets of Jordan.\"Mufleh came to the United States when she was 18 years old to attend college. \"I've always felt like an outsider, and I could identify with them,\" she said.A few days later, she returned to the apartment complex—this time with a soccer ball. The experience led her to form her first soccer team for refugee boys.\"We had 30 kids show up on the first day. And that's how it all started. It was very grass-roots,\" she said. They didn't have uniforms for their first game so Mufleh haggled for some white T-shirts at a discounted price. \"With a Sharpie, everybody wrote their numbers and their names and wrote Fugees on it. That was our first uniform,\" she said.   But Mufleh soon realized that what these kids needed went beyond the soccer field. She found herself helping the kids with their homework.\"I would go from apartment to apartment helping the kids with homework and eventually started an after-school tutoring program. What I realized when I was tutoring them was that it was just a Band-Aid solution,\" she said. \"Something bigger than after school needed to happen.\"Mufleh created the Fugees Family, a nonprofit organization, and then opened a privately funded school for refugees called the Fugees Academy in 2007. \"When this started, I was a little overwhelmed. I was like, 'How am I going to do this?' I'm not a principal. I'm not an educator, but I am a coach,\" she said. \"I'm good at building teams, and I'm good at getting groups of people to work together and find a goal that we all want to reach.\"She reached her goal and turned the school into reality.\"Typically our students have been in this country less than three or four months when they first come in. Most of them have fled war and unimaginable horrors. They've never been in a school before. They've been in refugee camps,\" she said.The academy has small class sizes so the students can get more individualized attention and learn the fundamentals of reading, writing and math.\"We have kids that come here who can't read when they enter school. And in four years, they are handing in five-page essays that are very well written,\" she said.The students come from various countries including Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan. \"On paper they should be failing. They have every excuse to fail. They come from a foreign country, they've had no formal education, they live in poverty and their parents are illiterate,\" she said. \"That is a statistic for a kid who will never complete high school. And these kids are going to complete high school.\"The academy has close to 80 students, who are enrolled in grades six through 12. In addition to after-school tutoring, the Fugees Family also includes soccer programs for boys and girls ages 10 to 18 and an academic summer camp. \"I love seeing the kids come alive,\" she said. \"Teachers always talk about the light in a kid's eye. And the most heartbreaking part is when that light is no longer there. And I don't get to see that. I get to see that light on every single day, and I love it.\"Fartun Hassan, a former student at the academy, said she liked the school because the classes were small. For her, Mufleh was more than a coach and a teacher. \"She is like a mother to us,\" she said. Despite the success her students have achieved, Mufleh said she can't always protect them from the prejudice that exists in the world. Since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, she has witnessed some anti-refugee sentiment toward her students.

{"_id":"Reid blasts Trump for hiring Bannon","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid led a Democratic assault Tuesday against President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as his chief White House adviser, arguing Bannon is linked to white nationalists and has supported anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-women views that should disqualify him.\"As long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office, it would be impossible to take Trump's efforts to heal the nation seriously,\" said Reid in an impassioned floor speech.Reid called on Trump to rescind his job offer to the former Breitbart News chief who was the CEO of Trump's insurgent campaign.  \"Rise to the dignity of the office of the president of the United States. Instead of hiding behind your Twitter account, and show America that racism, bullying and bigotry have no place in the White House or in America,\" he said.Reid argued that Trump's election had triggered a spree of hate crimes in the country by people emboldened by Trump's election. \"We have a responsibility to prevent Trump's bullying and aggressive behavior from becoming normalized in the eyes of America,\" said Reid, who is retiring at the end of the year. \"We have a responsibility to say it is not normal for the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan, to celebrate the election of a president they view as their champion with a victory parade.\"The No. 2 Senate Republican fired back at Reid for undermining Trump and Bannon and not giving them a chance. \"He does nothing to contribute to the healing of our country after a very polarizing, hotly contested election by continuing to pile of the President-elect and his team,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said. \"We had an election. The American people voted. The American people chose their next president.\"Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not comment on White House appointments.Reid's late-afternoon floor speech came the first day the Senate was back to work for its post-election lame-duck session.He was one of many Democrats who spoke out against Bannon.Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, led a news conference in the Capitol with four other Democrats next to a sign that read \"Fire Bannon.\"Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, was one of several Democrats issuing statements against the appointment. She warned that many minority communities were fearful of a Trump presidency even before he picked Bannon.\"Hiring Steve Bannon as a senior adviser in the White House will only further inflame these fears,\" she said. \"Virtually everyone who has contacted my office has expressed shock that Bannon, so closely linked to anti-Semitic and misogynistic opinions, will have the ear of the president.\"Republicans appeared more supportive.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said Democrats were being \"sour grapes\" because they lost the election and he hadn't seen anything about Bannon that was problematic.\"I think there are a lot of sour grapes out there. After people lose the election, they are pointing fingers trying to make him into a caricature. I've met him. I don't think he's a caricature of any of those horrible things the left is trying to bring out about him. I don't believe him to be a racist,\" Paul told CNN. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters he has not met Bannon but noted the Republican Jewish Coalition is supporting him, so will wait to make a decision. Graham did say, however, that he is not a fan of the \"alt-right.\"\"I will say this, the website in question was a friendly site to the alt-right. I don't like them and they don't like me, and I'm glad,\" Graham said.Democrats can complain about Bannon's new job but there's little they can do about it. For one thing, the position does not require Senate confirmation.CNN's Tom LoBianco and Manu Raju contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/politics/harry-reid-donald-trump-steven-bannon-floor-speech/index.html"}

{"_id":"Rewrite the Constitution? Here's how a convention could do it","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The increasing dominance of Republicans inside statehouses across the nation has spurred talk that a constitutional convention -- the very meeting that crafted the US Constitution -- could be more than just a Hail Mary thrown to conservatives. Conservative groups and Republican lawmakers have been planning for the possibility for years, although it picked up steam three years ago after a group of state lawmakers met at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate, just outside Washington.The issue found a bit of light in the Republican primaries, after Sen. Marco Rubio  said he would support a convention and has even won the support of some liberals, like Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, who wants to use a convention to undo the Citizens United ruling.The requirement that 34 state legislatures approve of any convention has long seemed too high a hurdle. But a series of surprise wins for Republicans in statehouses across the country on Election Night -- including taking control of both legislative chambers in 32 states -- has put the possibility within reach.What is a constitutional convention?We've already had one constitutional convention -- literally The Constitutional Convention, in 1787, which gave us the Constitution -- and there hasn't been one since. The document itself lays out the rules for calling a convention -- two-thirds of the states, or 34, have to petition Congress to call the meeting, according to Article V of the Constitution. But from there, it's open to interpretation -- and battling. Does each state get two delegates to send to the convention or do they get a number proportional to their population? Those are the kinds of questions that could make agreeing to a convention almost impossible.Despite the long odds, a group of lawmakers -- mostly Republicans -- have been meeting since 2013 to come up with guidelines to prevent total chaos. That group, The Assembly of State Legislatures, approved a detailed package of rules this year -- outlining everything from who would lead the group to how proposals would be debated.What do they want?The effort is being driven by conservative lawmakers and groups, who want a federal balanced budget amendment added to the Constitution (which would limit spending) and a broad decentralization of powers, sending more control to statehouses. The issue has gotten broad support from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) -- a conservative group that helps state lawmakers craft legislation -- and groups supported by the Koch Brothers. Throughout the administration of President Barack Obama, the movement gained steam as Republicans railed against Washington, although it's unclear whether the effort would lose steam with Republicans now in control in Washington.\"Our task is to lay the foundation of this building as solidly as we can, so that it can stand tall for future generations,\" Indiana's Senate leader, Sen. David Long, said in 2014, at a meeting of the group of lawmakers in Indianapolis. \"So it can provide a shelter necessary to protect those who use this building for the advancement of state's rights, whether today, tomorrow, or at any time in the future.\"Would it be successful? The short answer is: It's hard to tell. Under the current Constitution, if they could get enough states to approve opening a convention, any changes made in the convention would still have to be approved by at least 38 states -- the three-fourths majority of states. That limit, put in place specifically to guard against any swift, radical changes in the government, would guard against supporters of the new convention completely overhauling the Constitution, said Karla Jones, director for international affairs for ALEC. But they could also rewrite the rules entirely -- like the original framers of the Constitution did in 1787. Mike Klarman, Kirkland and Ellis professor of law at Harvard Law School and a constitutional historian, notes that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 had rules they had agreed on and were only supposed to tinker with the existing Articles of Confederation. Of course, they did a bit more than tinker ... Delegates gone wild? ... This is why some lawmakers and constitutional experts are apprehensive about re-opening the Constitution, via a convention: anything could go.\"It's not obvious most Americans would support freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or due process,\" said Klarman, who recently wrote \"The Framer's Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution.\"  The framers at the first, and only convention, made it hard for any one person to wrest away the reins of government on purpose, installing numerous checks on power like setting term-lengths. \"The framers were very shrewd about political power, they were always trying to constrain actors who were acting in their self-interest,\" he said. One of the things they were fighting at the time, he said, was a populist uprising among state and local leaders in the former colonies. But supporters of the efforts say those concerns are unfounded and say that any movement would be limited to the one topic that states petitioned for, e.g. a constitutional amendment mandating the government no longer run deficits.Jones, with ALEC, said that any successful petitioning of Congress would result in a \"convention of the states\" and not, specifically, a broad-sweeping constitutional convention.\"The applications are very specific, the leaders in the movements have drawn up a very detailed set of rules,\" Jones said. \"The chances of a convention running away, so to speak, are minimal.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/constitutional-convention-explainer/index.html"}

Marco Rubio and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate in the general election, are promoting a bill in the Senate Thursday that calls on US government agencies to report anti-Semitic activity more thoroughly and for the State Department to share more widely any new information on how the US and Europe are addressing the needs of the continent's Jewish community.\"I am alarmed by the steady increase in anti-Semitism we're witnessing in America and Europe. We must be vigilant in reporting any incidents of anti-Semitism to ensure the safety, security and inalienable rights of Jewish communities,\" Kaine said in a statement. \"This legislation will help the State Department and Europeans work together to combat anti-Semitism and protect religious freedom for Jews and society at large.\"It is some of the first legislative activity in the latest phase of their Senate careers: Rubio was just re-elected to the Senate and Kaine just indicated Thursday that he plans to run for re-election and not try to leave the body for a 2020 presidential campaign.Jews are leaving places like France in record numbers and landing in places such as Israel in part due to recent attacks on Jewish sites in countries like Belgium and Denmark.Fears of anti-Semitism have also spiked in the US during the 2016 campaign and Trump's election. A number of journalists have reported receiving anti-Semitic tweets and mailings from Trump supporters, and some Jewish groups have been dismayed by the elevation of Steve Bannon, a top Trump aide who is allied with the alt-right movement.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/marco-rubio-tim-kaine-anti-semitism/index.html"}
{"_id":"Rubio: Trump's Cuba policy should 'pave the way' for democracy","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday he is confident that President-elect Donald Trump will stake a hard line on Cuba, and in the wake of Fidel Castro's death said efforts should focus on promoting democracy there. \"Our goal is the national security and national interests of the United States and, as part of that, to do everything possible through our foreign policy towards Cuba to incentivize and pave the way for the move toward democracy,\" Rubio told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" Trump has previously said he would roll back efforts by President Barack Obama to normalize relations with the country, marked in part by the re-opening of the US embassy there. But Rubio -- a staunch Obama critic on the issue -- said any effort would have to be weighed against national security. \"If there's a policy that helps that, it remains in place. And if it's a policy that doesn't, it's removed. And that's what I would encourage them to do. And I look forward to working with them on that,\" he said.But Trump's own position has become a question because his public statements taking a hard line on Cuba appear to be at odds with his comments to CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier this year that he would like to open a hotel there.Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, would not say Sunday whether Trump still planned to build a hotel there, and blasted back at Obama. \"We should not be romanticizing Fidel Castro, who was a ruthless dictator who imprisoned and tortured and had murdered many Cubans,\" Conway told Bash in a separate interview. \"What Trump is also saying is he just objects to the way we re-engaged diplomatic relations with Cuba in the last several years in this administration because we got nothing in return.\"Trump, Rubio and other Republicans also blasted Obama in the wake of Fidel Castro's death Saturday, after the President issued a statement that declined to denounce Castro's humanitarian abuses. Rubio called Obama's remarks \"pathetic\" but he declined to hit Pope Francis for also leaving Castro's human rights violations out of his statement. \"Pope Francis is the leader of a religious organization, the Roman Catholic Church. Barack Obama is the president of the most powerful country in the world,\" Rubio said. \"As a practicing Catholic, I believe in the theological authority of the bishop of Rome. And that's what Pope Francis is.\"He added: \"On political matters, however, particularly on foreign policy issues, I don't necessarily believe that that binds those of us in the faith in terms of issues of foreign policy. I still respect it, but this is a very different thing.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/politics/donald-trump-cuba-marco-rubio-kellyanne-conway/index.html"}

Fresh start?Many in Russia had expected Hillary Clinton -- who has been consistently critical of the Kremlin and is deeply unpopular in Moscow as a result -- to sweep to victory on November 8. Following Trump's unexpected win, there are hopes of a fresh start -- though Trump told the New York Times this week that he was not looking to \"reset\" US-Russia relations.Asked about Trump's comments, Peskov referred to Clinton's previous ill-fated attempt to \"reset\" relations while serving as Secretary of State.\"As for a reset, we can only agree with the President-elect because this word has embarrassed itself as the consequences of that reset are not the ones we'd like to see,\" Peskov said. \"The term doesn't matter. It's about a will and showing the readiness for normalizing the relations -- these are the most important things.\"Western sanctionsRelations between the US and Russia have deteriorated in recent years. They reached a low point in 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Kremlin leader was toppled in what Moscow describes as a Western-backed coup. Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in eastern Ukraine prompted Western sanctions.The West's policies on Ukraine, new US missile bases in Eastern Europe, and NATO troop deployments near Russia's borders are all viewed by the Kremlin as evidence of US aggression.In an interview recorded earlier this year with the filmmaker Oliver Stone -- when the pollsters were predicting an overwhelming victory for Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election -- Putin vowed to respond. \"We need to take counter measures ... to pose a threat to rocket systems that are threatening to us,\" he told Stone in the director's latest controversial offering, \"Ukraine On Fire.\"In October, Russia's military sent nuclear-capable \"Iskander\" missiles to its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad, within striking distance of Eastern European targets. A senior Russian defense official said one of the missiles had been deliberately exposed to US spy satellites in what US intelligence officials interpreted as a \"gesture to express disapproval\" with NATO. Geopolitical shift\"Why are we reacting to NATO expansion so emotionally?\" Putin asked in the Stone documentary, broadcast on Russian television on November 21, a national holiday in Ukraine which marks the toppling of the pro-Russian government.\"When a country becomes a NATO member, it becomes hard for it to resist the pressure from such a big country -- NATO's leader -- like the United States,\" he said.The comments were interpreted as a shot across the bows of Clinton, who might have been on the cusp of entering the White House when the documentary aired.But the geopolitical landscape has unexpectedly shifted in the meantime. Trump, who won the US presidential election against the odds, campaigned on a platform of detente with Russia and has expressed reservations about NATO.While the possibility of a dramatic fallout with the Kremlin remains real, so is the prospect of a warmer phase in relations between Moscow and Washington.CNN's Bryony Jones and Matt Wells contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/russia-kremlin-us-ties-improve/index.html"}
{"_id":"Rwanda's Catholic Church says sorry for its role in 1994 genocide","articleText":" (CNN)The Catholic Church in Rwanda has apologized for its members' role in the genocide that saw hundreds of thousands of Rwandans killed in 1994.  Rwandan bishops asked for \"forgiveness for sins of hatred and disagreement that happened in the country to the point of hating our own countrymen because of their origin,\" in a statement read after mass in parishes across the country Sunday. In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month killing spree that left an estimated 800,000 people dead.Hutu attackers burned down churches with hundreds or thousands of Tutsis inside. The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu, in a plane crash April 6, 1994.Although the church states it did not send anyone to participate in the killings, it acknowledges that its members were active, apologizing for \"Christian leaders who caused divisions among people and planted seeds of hate.\"The church released its apology to coincide with the last day of the Jubilee Year of Mercy declared by Pope Francis.  Four Catholic priests were indicted by the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for their role in the genocide in 2001. Among them was Rwandan Catholic Priest Athanse Seromba who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2006, increased to life imprisonment, for actively participating in the massacre of around 2,000 Tutsis who sought protection in his church.The United Nations has criticized the Catholic Church in the past for its failure to apologize for its complicity in the killings. Human rights groups have also joined in the criticism of the church and its role in the genocide. Groups such as African Rights, who research the genocide, say there is \"overwhelming evidence that church leaders maintained their silence in the face of genocide,\" according to a 1998 report.  They argue that the small number of indictments do not accurately represent the church's role in the genocide.Some Rwandan commentators praised the apology as an important first step but said it didn't go far enough. \"I think it's a good start,\" said Gatete Nyiringabo, who works with the Rwanda-based Institute of Policy Analysis and Research. \"This shows the church is finally reforming.\" But Nyiringabo added: \"It was a half apology,\" noting the statement's absence of any policy recommendations. \"They didn't indicate which bishops, and they didn't speak of the Catholic Church as a whole,\" he said. While several priests have been tried in the UN tribunal and in local courts, Rwandan genocide scholar Tom Ndahiro said that others continue to operate without repercussions. \"There are many more [priests] who have not been held into account,\"  said Ndahiro. \"None of them have been held responsible by the Catholic Church itself and that is what is missing. You have civil courts that have tried them but the church has its laws and none of them has been held to account by the Catholic Church.\" \"What they have done is a good step forward,\" he said. \"It's significant only if it is followed by actions,\" he added.

{"_id":"San Antonio officer shot to death during traffic stop","articleText":" (CNN)A San Antonio police officer was fatally shot during a traffic stop Sunday in what the department's chief described as a targeted killing similar to recent police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \"I believe that the uniform was targeted,\" Police Chief William McManus said at a Monday news conference. Detective Benjamin Marconi, a 20-year veteran of the department, was shot in his patrol car outside police headquarters, McManus said Sunday. Marconi was 50 years old.\"[When] most families will be celebrating the holidays, SAPD will be burying one of its own because of an ultimate act of cowardice by a suspect who will be caught and brought to justice,\" the chief said.McManus said \"a lot of things\" were captured on Marconi's dashboard camera, but he would not elaborate. Police asked the public for help finding the suspect, whom McManus described as a slim black man in his 20s or 30s in a gray shirt and gray pants. He stands between 5-feet-7-inches and 6-feet tall and has a goatee, police said.He is believed to have fled the shooting scene in a Mitsubishi Galant with chrome rims and dark tinted windows. \"We consider the suspect to be extremely dangerous and a clear threat to law enforcement officers and the public,\" he said. The shooting occurred in front of police headquarters before noon, McManus said. Marconi had just pulled over a driver on the south side of the building and returned to his patrol car to write a ticket when a man pulled up behind him. The man walked up to the patrol car driver's side window and shot the officer in the head, McManus said. The man then reached through the open window and shot him a second time, McManus said.After the shooting, the man returned to his vehicle and drove away. Police say the suspect paid a visit to San Antonio Public Safety Headquarters prior to the shooting. He asked the desk clerk a question, but McManus would not relay what the suspect said. The timestamp of a surveillance video shows the man entering the building about 7:45 a.m.Earlier Sunday, McManus likened the shooting to recent deaths of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Both of those incidents followed police-involved shootings of civilians that triggered protests nationwide. Police are investigating motive in this case, including a possible connection to a Sunday morning officer-involved shooting in Dallas, McManus said. \"Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it's happened here,\" he said.\"It's always difficult, especially in this day and age where police are being targeted across the county,\" he added. \"Hopefully we'll solve this one real quick, and if this individual is a danger to more police or anyone else we will try to get him off the street as soon as we can.\"San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor condemned the shooting and called for patience while the investigation continues.\"I want to extend my deepest condolences to the family of the officer killed outside police headquarters today as well as to our entire police force. This type of crime cannot and will not be tolerated. I ask for the community's thoughtfulness and patience as the investigation continues and SAPD searches for the suspect,\" Taylor said.CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Eliott C.

Otis Tyrone McKane, 31, was arrested around 4:30 p.m. while riding with a woman and a 2-year-old child in a car on Interstate 10, Chief William McManus said.\"This is the person's whose image we saw on surveillance,\" McManus said at a press conference. \"This is also the person we believe is responsible for the cold and calculated murder of Detective Marconi.\"Detective Benjamin Marconi, a 20-year veteran of the department, was shot to death while writing a traffic ticket outside of police headquarters Sunday. The department released footage of a man seen inside police headquarters four hours before the shooting and video of a car leaving the scene, CNN-affiliate KPRC reported. McManus, who said he believed Marconi was targeted because he was a police officer, told reporters that he doesn't believe McKane has any relationship to the driver pulled over before the shooting, CNN-affiliate KRIS reported.McKane was kept under surveillance for several hours before a SWAT team made the arrest without injuries, McManus said. The woman he was with was driving at the time of the arrest, he said.Police have located the black Mitsubishi Galant seen leaving the shooting scene and are processing it for evidence, McManus said. Texas Rangers, U.S. Marshal deputies and FBI agents assisted in the investigation, the chief said.\"The motive for the capital murder is still unknown,\" McManus told reporters. \"This is very much an ongoing investigation.\"The killing happened a  few minutes before noon on Sunday. Officer Marconi pulled over a driver on the south side of the police station. He returned to his patrol car to write a ticket.That's when a man pulled up behind him.

After the shooting, the man returned to his vehicle and drove away.Chief: Attack resembles ambushes in Dallas, Baton RougeMcManus likened the shooting to the fatal ambushes of police officers in Dallas, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this year. In July, sniper Micah Xavier Johnson killed five officers who attempted to protect activists that were marching in Dallas following the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men killed by police this summer. It was the deadliest single incident for US law enforcement since September 11, 2001. Later that month, Iraq veteran Gavin Long fatally shot three officers in Baton Rouge in an ambush attack.Police are investigating motive in this case, including a possible connection to a shooting Sunday morning in Dallas involving an officer, McManus said. \"Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it's happened here,\" he said.It wasn't the only ambush attack on Sunday: A police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, was wounded in an ambush shooting but is expected to survive.\"It's always difficult, especially in this day and age where police are being targeted across the county,\" McManus added.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/san-antonio-police-officer-killed/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sanders calls for assessment of Electoral College","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday it is time to re-examine the Electoral College, after Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote to President-elect Donald Trump. \"We have one candidate who had two million more votes than the other candidate but she is not going to be sworn in as president, and I think on the surface that's a little bit weird,\" the Vermont senator told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"Other Democrats, including California Sen. Barbara Boxer, have flatly called for the Electoral College to be abolished and have presidents be elected by a simple popular vote. The effort gained some steam in Democratic-controlled statehouses in the years after Al Gore beat George W. Bush in the popular vote. But since any change would require a constitutional amendment, that appears highly unlikely to happen. Sanders, meanwhile, hewed close to the line that Clinton's former campaign has walked on a recount effort being led by former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The former Clinton campaign had been mum on calls for a recount, but said over the weekend that it would help the effort in Wisconsin. Sanders said that even though Trump has called it a \"scam\" anyone has a right to a recount.\"The Green Party has the legal right,\" Sanders said. \"Republicans have requested -- I think the governor of North Carolina right now is thinking about doing a recount. That's a legal right. They do it.\"Sanders also weighed in on the future of the Democratic Party -- a battle that started almost immediately after Clinton conceded the election and features one of his former backers, US Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. The Obama White House is seeking a more moderate alternative to Ellison, but Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress) is the right person to rebuild the Democratic Party's \"grassroots,\" Sanders said.\"In the last eight years, the Democrats have lost over 900 legislative seats around the country in state legislatures, I think it's time to take a reassessment of the purpose of where the Democratic Party is and where it wants to go,\" Sanders said on \"State of the Union.\" \"What we need to do right now is to become a grassroots party, which is what Keith Ellison believes, open the doors to working people, open the doors to young people, less emphasis on raising large sums of money, more emphasis on bringing new blood into the political party.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/politics/bernie-sanders-electoral-college/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sanders: If Trump has the 'guts' to take on corporate America, he's got an ally","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump will find himself with an unlikely ally if he makes good on his promise to be an economic populist challenging corporate America, Bernie Sanders said Thursday.\"If Mr. Trump has the guts to stand up to those corporations,\" said the former Democratic presidential candidate, \"he will have an ally with me.\"The willingness on the part of Sanders, a longtime democratic socialist, to work with Trump on a series of economic issues underscores the unorthodox and strikingly populist message that Trump used during his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton.Sanders, speaking with reporters at a Christian Science Monitor sponsored breakfast, said he is ready to embrace Trump on a handful of campaign promises. Those include protecting Social Security and Medicare, negotiating for lower drug prices, raising the minimum wage to $10, imposing tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas, and re-regulating Wall Street by re-establishing Glass-Steagall.On these issues, Trump's promises put the President-elect closer to Sanders than to most Republican Party leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for example, would not commit to passing Trump's tariff plan during a Sunday appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union with Jake Tapper,\" saying that the solution is reforming the US tax code, \"not tariffs, not trade wars.\"  By embracing Trump's left-leaning stands, Sanders is hoping to make progress on issues of long-standing concern to the Vermont senator. If Trump backs away from these promises and sides with the conventional conservatives who lead the Republican Party in Congress, Sanders believes that Trump will be exposed as a \"fraud.\"Sanders has not spoken one-on-one with ClintonSanders, who is promoting his new book, \"Our Revolution: A Future To Believe In,\" during a series of appearances across Washington, is stepping into the leadership vacuum of the Democratic Party.He said it was not productive to look backward, waving off a question about whether he could have defeated Trump if he had won the Democratic nomination with a \"who knows?\" response.Long-running tensions between Sanders and Clinton have not fully cooled. Sanders said he had not spoken directly with Clinton following her loss, but only on conference call with other Senate Democrats.Several Clinton advisers have blamed the primary campaign with Sanders for weakening Clinton's candidacy in the general election, a suggestion Sanders dismissed.\"At the end of the day, my candidacy ended up being helpful to her -- if we believe candidates should not be anointed,\" Sanders said. \"I'm happy to say my campaign brought millions of people into the political process, the vast majority of whom ended up voting for Hillary Clinton. I think it played a very positive role.\"Sanders said Clinton \"has a very important role to play\" in rebuilding the Democratic Party, noting that she received more votes than Trump.\"Does that mean she and I are going to agree on every issue?\" Sanders said. \"Frankly, we are not going to agree on every issue, but her voice is important to be heard.\"Sanders vows to hold Trump accountableEven as Sanders offers to work with Trump on the populist components of his economic program, critical differences remain.Sanders is calling on Trump to fire Steve Bannon, the controversial former Breitbart executive who was recently named chief strategist of the Trump White House.Sanders is promising to fight Trump \"tooth and nail\" on climate change, an issue that Trump has dismissed as a \"hoax.\" The Vermont senator opposes Trump's tax policy, which would cut taxes for the top 1% of earners by $317,000 per year, according to the Tax Policy Center.And Sanders said it would be \"an outrage\" that would \"completely divide the country\" if Trump were to make good on his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to \"lock up\" Clinton.But on a series of bread-and-butter issues, Sanders said that Trump's campaign spoke to the concerns of the working class and promised to work with the President-elect \"if Mr. Trump was sincere.\"Asked by CNN about Trump's call to establish tariffs on companies that relocate jobs overseas, a promise that Trump set forth in his \"Contract with the American Voter,\" Sanders said that Trump was right to stand up to corporations like Carrier and Nabisco that want to outsource jobs and vowed to work with Trump on this issue. \"A tariff may well be one of those options,\" Sanders said.\"(Trump) talked about a collapsing middle class in America,\" said Sanders. \"He is right.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-allies/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sandy Hook families file state supreme court appeal in case against gun makers        ","articleText":" (CNN)The families of nine victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre -- who filed suit against gun makers and recently lost their bid to take the case to trial -- are now asking Connecticut's Supreme Court to hear their appeal. In October, Connecticut superior court judge Barbara Bellis ruled in favor of Remington -- the gun manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15, used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six educators -- by granting their motion to strike the case. Previously, Bellis had allowed the discovery phase to proceed and had even assigned a tentative trial date for 2018. In their appeal, attorneys for the families describe the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School as \"a singular event in Connecticut history\" that was carried out by a man with a weapon \"designed for our armed forces and engineered to deliver maximum carnage.\" They argue Remington is responsible since the company \"chose to sell a weapon of war and aggressively market its assaultive capabilities.\" \"It is only appropriate that Connecticut's highest court decide whether these families have the right to proceed.\" In her October order in favor of Remington, Bellis ruled that gun makers are immune by the provisions set forth in a federal statute known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. That law, signed by President George W. Bush in 2005, has since prohibited lawsuits against gun manufacturers and distributors if their firearms are used in a criminal act. \"If you were starting over again to create the safest environment for our society you would not write this law,\" said Ian Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed in the mass shooting. \"It is unnatural in the level of protection it gives the gun industry. Instead you would create roles ensuring that such weapons are entrusted to responsible citizens who comply with sensible laws about the training required to own one and their safe storage and usage.\"The Sandy Hook families had sought an exemption to the law through a claim of \"negligent entrustment,\" arguing the companies knowingly marketed and sold the AR-15 to a particularly vulnerable group of young men. \"We feel strongly that the critical issues raised in this case belong before our state's Supreme Court and we hope the Court agrees,\" said the families' attorney Josh Koskoff in a press release. \"Our only goal in bringing this appeal is to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening,\" said Nicole Hockley, mother of Dylan, in a statement. \"And we have faith that Connecticut's Supreme Court will take up what is literally a matter of life and death.\" \"As a father who lost a bright and shining child, all we ask is for our day in court to address the negligence of these companies,\" said David Wheeler, whose son, Benjamin, age 6, was also killed in the Sandy Hook shooting. Remington have not responded to CNN's request for comment. ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/health/sandy-hook-families-appeal-to-connecticut-supreme-court/index.html"}

{"_id":"Sarah Jessica Parker on the humor, pathos and brutality of 'Divorce'","articleText":" (CNN)Sarah Jessica Parker finds it ironic that couples who divorce have to come together in order to end their marriage. That's the premise of her HBO comedy, \"Divorce.\" Parker stars in the series as Frances, a woman who discovers that breakups aren't always clean. The show brought Parker back to HBO earlier this fall -- nearly 12 years after \"Sex and the City\" wrapped. \"I didn't think I would be back on television,\" Parker told CNN. \"Nobody presented themselves to me until Frances came along.\"In a recent interview with CNN, Parker discussed \"Divorce\" and revealed what's next for Frances.How would you describe Frances, at this stage of the series?What we will see from Frances is that she wants very much for it [her divorce] to be a civilized, mature exchange. What we discover is that they both seem ill equipped. Most people aren't equipped to divorce well. It isn't something we have a lot of practice doing, hopefully. There's so many emotions tied up in separation and the irony that in order to divorce, you need that other person, I think, is so bizarre. The very person you're trying most to separate from is the person that you need most desperately to walk through with you. Divorce, the word itself, sounds so scary to so many people. What do you think this show says about divorce?What we're saying -- in this story -- is that this is a family that isn't in a financial position to throw money at the problem and walk away and be kind of buoyant about the process. We're telling the story of a divorce that's probably very familiar to a lot of Americans who really struggle through it, who are surprised by what confronts them, who have to deal with financial issues that are complex and often really hard to comprehend. Children complicate things, as they should, even more so. That's the story we wanted to tell. I don't think this is a morality tale. I don't think we're offering a lesson. What I'm hoping is that if it's not familiar, that it's understandable, relatable -- that people's emotions are things that we can all connect to, whether we've had the exact same experience.This is a such a departure from your real life. You're happily married with this wonderful family. How did you prepare for a role like this? I started developing this show about four years ago. The reason I was interested in the landscape was that I was looking around at friends and family and people that were close to me, who had been in long-term, committed relationships -- not just conventional relationships, but really substantive relationships -- a lot of people were at a point of reckoning. We all know people who have contemplated divorce, survived divorce, felt like they didn't survive divorce. It was incredibly hard on the family. The family came out better for it, triumphant in some way. We know people, all of us, who have contemplated affairs, had affairs. The marriage survived the affair. The marriage was undone by the affair. It wasn't necessarily research that I had to do. I was interested in what it means to have loved and what it means to be in battle with that person -- and how you can tell the story both with humor and real pathos and real brutality.Related Link: Sarah Jessica Parker t","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/entertainment/sarah-jessica-parker-divorce-interview/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sarkozy out of France's Republican presidential race","articleText":" (CNN)France's first Republican presidential primary has ended in a surprising runoff between two former prime ministers and halted a political comeback by former President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Sarkozy came in third in the field of seven vying for the nomination for France's center-right party. The shock winner was Francois Fillon, who staged a remarkable late surge to win the vote.He'll contest Alain Juppe in a second-round vote for the party's nomination on November 27.It's assumed the winner will be the one to contest the leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, for the presidency.Le Pen's anti-Europe and anti-immigration stance has been gaining popularity among French voters, and in an interview with CNN last week, she said she'd been emboldened by Donald Trump's recent victory in the United States. It \"makes the French realize that what the people want, they can get, if they mobilize themselves,\" she said.With more than three-quarters of polling places reporting, Fillon had around 44% of the vote followed by Juppe with about 28%.  Sarkozy brought in 20% and said in a concession tweet, \"I wish the best for my country and for the one who will have to lead the France that I love -- NS\"In a concession speech, Sarkozy said he will support the 62-year-old Fillon in the runoff. Who is Francois Fillon?Fillon, 62, is a lawyer who served as Sarkozy's prime minister between 2007 and 2012. As a Catholic from Le Mans, a village in north-west France, he symbolizes the traditional provincial right. Fillon aims to end the 35-hour work week, cut public spending, abolish the wealth tax, reduce immigration and invest 12 billion euros in security, defense and justice.Just a few weeks ago, Fillon was considered an unlikely bet for the presidency but won over voters with a polished performance in televised debates.He apparently also struck the right tone on the fight against Islamist terrorism and ISIS after publishing a new book called \"Beating Islamic Totalitarianism.\"After his win, Fillon tweeted a message to the French electorate.\"I thank the French people who supported me and I send a message of respect and coming together to the other voters.\"Who is Alain Juppe?Juppe, 71, is the current mayor of Bordeaux who also served as prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under President Jacques Chirac.He's considered a moderate who promises to promote a \"happy national identity\" if he comes to power. Juppe has also promised economic reform, effective border control within and outside Europe, an end to the 35-hour work week, and more investment in security and the fight against terrorism.Because of the unpopularity of President Francois Hollande's socialist party, the Republican nominee will likely face Le Pen in the final round of the presidential race in May. Leader of the National Front since 2011, Le Pen is a fierce euroskeptic who has said there would be no place for multiculturalism if she took power.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/europe/france-primary/index.html"}

Eventually, he was taken in at an orphanage and adopted by a couple in Australia, after officials failed to locate his family and hometown.Since Sheru did not know how to spell his name, Brierley ended up going by an incorrectly spelled version -- \"Saroo.\"Twenty years later, Brierley decided to launch a search for the mother, siblings and home he remembered only in fuzzy childhood memories. To do this, he decided to retrace his steps using Google Earth. Those who don't know the rest of the story soon will. (Warning: Some movie spoilers follow below.)Brierley's journey to find his family in India is the subject for The Weinstein Co's \"Lion,\" a movie due out November 25 that is a likely Oscar contender. But when he started his quest, Brierley said the possibilities -- the interest in his story, his subsequent book and the film starring Dev Patel that now tells his tale -- were the farthest thing from his mind. \"I was just so high on hope and so determined to find what I'd been sort of yearning for for some time and defuse the weight off my shoulders,\" Brierley told CNN in a recent interview. Brierley has now seen \"Lion\" a few times, he said. And even though he lived the experience, he said the film was a \"roller coaster of emotions.\" \"I tried to suppress my tears but I couldn't,\" he said. \"It was just so hard to.\" He wasn't the only one. Brierley said his Australian mother Sue, played in the film by Nicole Kidman, was \"enchanted\" by the movie. \"She was speechless at some times, to the point where she grabbed my leg and almost dug her nails into it,\" Brierley said, laughing. Brierley's warm relationship with his adoptive mother is one of many emotional drivers in the movie. And though some parts of the movie were \"heightened\" for storytelling purposes, Brierley said it was important to him and the filmmakers that the characters be portrayed authentically. He was especially pleased with one key scene between Patel and Kidman, in which they talk about her motivation for adopting him as a boy.\"The way that was acted out was just so organic and pure,\" he said. There's one key opinion Brierley is still waiting to get -- that of his birth mother, Fatima Bi Munshi.He said they're working on getting the movie translated into her native Hindi, as she does not read. Though he's recounted his experience to her before, he thinks the movie will put the journey into a greater perspective. \"I think it's going to give her a shock as in, 'Whoa, I didn't realize that this is actually what happened,'\" he said. CNN's Sara Sidner visited Brierley's mother back in 2012, shortly after the two had been reunited. Then, she recounted the disappearance of her son and spoke about the devastating second loss she experienced the same year. Brierley's oldest brother, who had accompanied him that fateful night, was killed a month after Brierley went missing. \"I would go to sleep at night and my mind would wander in madness,\" she said. \"I didn't feel like eating. I kept looking out for him on the streets, asking people about his whereabouts. I found him nowhere. It was a very difficult time.\"Brighter days have fallen upon the once fractured family. Brierley said he's been back to India about 14 times since they were reunited, in part thanks to the trips he's taken as a result of the interest in the story of their reunion.\"It's worked pretty well and I'm so touched and humbled about everything — that things like this can happen,\" Brierley said. \"I wish there were more stories like this.\" He's working to make that happen. Brierley said he hopes to get into script writing, with a focus on penning films that lift people's spirits. He wants them to walk into the theater \"thinking about things that are going to change their minds in a positive way [or] ... who they are as humans.\" Brierley's life has undoubtedly changed as a result of what started as an against-the-odds quest. And though the ultimate result came with some sadness, he said at the end of the day, \"that's just life.\" \"I guess this was my destiny,\" he said. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/entertainment/lion-movie-saroo-brierley-real-story/index.html"}
{"_id":"Satirical children's book cover illustrations draw criticism","articleText":" (CNN)Abrams book publisher announced this week it will honor the \"Bad Little Children's Books\" author's request to no longer publish his book, following a social media backlash.    \"Satire can be ugly,\" Abrams said in a statement on behalf of the author, writing under the pseudonym Arthur C. Gackley. \"However, the book is clearly not being read by some in the way I had intended — as satire — and, more disturbingly, is being misread as the very act of hate and bigotry that the work was meant to expose, not promote. For this reason, I have asked ABRAMS to cease publishing the book.\" Abrams did not respond to a CNN request to disclose the identity of the author. \"Bad Little Children's Books\" is a collection of mock children's book covers that parody hot-button topics like racism and discrimination.At the center of the controversy is the debate on whether the images portrayed in the book are satire or bigotry? One of the book's online critics called it \"disgusting and utterly racist.\" One cover titled \"Happy Burkaday Timmy!\" portrays a girl in a veil holding a ticking present, while another illustrates the \"Rockets and Missiles of the Islamic State.\" A different cover paints a Native American family with the title \"The Anti-Vaccine Kid and the Gift of the Navajo Blanket Riddled With Smallpox.\"Illustrations in the book tackle not only race, but also macabre depictions of death or injury and lewd sexual themes, among others. CNN received a copy of the book directly from Abrams Books.The book's cover features a yellow strip along the joint made to resemble the gold spine of the classic Little Golden Books -- except instead of cute animals and flowers, it has skulls, guns, bombs and knives.On the front, the book says it contains parodies, spoofs and \"offensively tweaked covers.\"Bigotry or satire?Though it was released in September, the book was thrust into the limelight Friday after the book-related news blog Book Riot excoriated the tittle for its \"racist, xenophobic and religious bigotry\" themes.\"There comes a point when 'funny' becomes straight-up hate and when that hate is straight-up racist,\" wrote former librarian, author and blogger Kelly Jensen. \"This 'humor' adds to the misinformation, adds to the hatred, and ultimately, makes living in this society more frustrating, difficult, and dangerous for so many. And this 'humor' is the kind of garbage that needs to be eliminated at all levels, particularly in publishing,\" she wrote. After a Twitterstorm calling for Abrams Books to recall the tittle, the publisher issued a statement Saturday standing by \"Bad Little Children's Books.\" But come Sunday, Abrams Books backpedaled. The publisher defended the book's publication but said it would respect the author's request and suspend future publications.  \"Some reviewers and commenters on social media have taken elements of the book at face value, which, we believe, misses the point of the book as a work of artistic parody and satire,\" read a company statement, released via Twitter. \"Its intention is to shine a spotlight on stereotypes about race, gender, and difference that have become commonplace in today's world and to, in fact, skewer all levels of societal bias.\"A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, called that statement a \"wild\" claim.\"It is probably wild that they claim it is to expose intolerance and bigotry,\" Hooper said. \"I think it had the opposite effect of promoting it and exploiting it. Bottom line is they have the right to publish this kind of material, but should they? And I think given the divisions we have seen in our society I don't think it is the best use of the First Amendment.\"Freedom of speechFreedom of speech and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, argued Hooper. He called for tolerance and mutual understanding instead of the \"promotion of hatred and division.\"In a public letter, the National Coalition Against Censorship came to Abrams' defense, asserting \"free expression and intellectual freedom.\" \"We urge the company not to accede to pressure to withdraw the book, but to stand for the proposition that it is the right of authors to write as they choose and of individuals to decide for themselves what to read. After all, anyone who doesn't like the book doesn't have to buy it,\" the NCAC said in its letter.Abrams President Michael Jacobs sits on the Board of Directors of NCAC.  A 'fine line' of satireSatire and bigotry are not mutually exclusive, said Jason Steed, a Texas Supreme Court and appellate attorney and former English professor. He has written about the role humor plays in identity, most recently during the US election.\"We use humor socially to figure out who we fit in with and what groups we are excluded from,\" Steed told CNN.He gave the example of two white people making a racist joke while a black person is in the room. \"The two white people can assimilate while alienating the black person. What is the humor doing? People who are offended will feel alienated by the humor. If we find it funny, we are assimilating with the group who is assimilating with the joke,\" he explained.Satire however, can get complicated, warns Steed. \"The humor may not mean to be racist but to mock racism, and that may be some of what they (Abrams) are trying to get at. You push it to some kind of extreme,\" he said.But \"there may be a fine line with trying to make a point with satire and really hurting a lot of people. Everyone needs to figure out where the line is and decide what it means to be responsible.\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/us/satirical-book-outrage/index.html"}
{"_id":"Schools on the front lines heal their wounds post-election ","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)Eric Witherspoon is superintendent of Evanston Township High School outside Chicago and when he arrived on campus the morning after the election, he knew he needed to do something.\"I was encountering students and I was realizing, 'Oh my goodness. They're dealing with their own personal emotions and trying to sort this out just as I, as an adult, am trying to do,' \" said Witherspoon, now in his 11th year in his position.So, with about 20 minutes spare between meetings, he jotted down some lines that he would deliver over the school's PA system during the morning announcements.\"Once in a while it's important that we pause and reflect on who we are and reaffirm our appreciation for one another,\" he told the school's roughly 3000 students. \"You attend a school where we not only respect differences, we embrace our diversity.\"After mentioning diversity including race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and special needs, he went on to urge students to be kind and caring to one another.\"Redouble your support to one another,\" he said. \"And even though we cannot always control what is going on in the larger world around us, we can define our own school, our own community.\"After his comments, students applauded and soon started coming to his office asking for a copy of his remarks, said Witherspoon. Staff members and parents emailed asking for copies too. He then began hearing from teachers within the community and eventually from educators across the state and the country, who either wanted copies or told him they were using his words with their own students.\"Within a day or two, we realized, 'Oh my, this has gone viral,' \" said Witherspoon, a lifelong educator who has served as superintendent for 28 years in four different districts in three different states. Witherspoon realized how hungry people were to think about what had happened and put it all into perspective in terms of who they were and where they were in their lives. \"That's when I realized, 'wow, this is just something that we all very much need ... and on any end of the political spectrum',\" he said.The number of hateful acts, including the posting of swastikas on school premises, has increased since Donald Trump was elected president, along with the occurrence of students across the country walking out of class in protest of Trump's victory, leaving teachers and administrators on the front lines during a very divided time. They must try to calm students' fears and bring school communities together.Helping students find ways to get involved At the Seattle Girls' School, a grade 5-8 school where 35% of students identify themselves as non-white, eighth graders are already talking with faculty members about what they can do post-election. Possible plans include producing a video that would offer a student-to-student message against hate crimes or hateful incidents that are happening in schools across the country, or partnering with organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center to help monitor hate crimes or hate incidents in schools.The students are thinking up creative ways to give them a \"more active voice and feel like this is not just something that has happened to them, but that they can be involved in what comes next,\" said Barbara Frailey, assistant head of school for the Seattle Girls' School.Administrators say while no student that they know of has been subjected to a hateful or discriminatory act since Trump's victory, there is a real concern on the part of many of the students.\"We have a student who wears a hijab and she spoke about being worried about wearing that publicly in society and what that might subject her to,\" said Brenda Leaks, head of the school. Leaks adds that a couple of students use public transportation to get to and from school and had told her before the election that they didn't feel scared to get on a bus by themselves, but they now worry that their president's history and experiences may change things and \"that other people might look at that and say, 'Well, it's OK. I'm just gonna grope someone', \" she said. Jennifer Frankling, a teacher at Lee M. Thurston High School in Redford, Michigan, said she sensed some fear and uncertainly on the part of her students after the election and that news stories of bullying incidents have only increased the anxiety.While she said her husband voted for Trump and in no way can be categorized as someone who votes for hate, she knew the fear at school was real and that she needed to do something about it.\"My job as an educator is to let them know that so many people stand with them. No matter who a person voted for, bullying is never OK,\" she said in an email to CNN.Frankling asked if any of her students wanted to hear about the 'safety pin movement' she saw on Facebook, where people wear safety pins as a symbol that they support diversity, and eight of her juniors did. She brought out some beads and safety pins that she had bought at Walmart and the students quickly got to work.When her journalism students -- juniors and seniors -- came in, they quickly wanted to help.\"Once we ran out of supplies and I promised to purchase more, I told the students to take as many pins as they would like and to share them with the others,\" said Frankling, who's also a mom of two, ages 9 and 12. \"I have been bombarded with students and staff asking for a pin.\"'They made 300 pins and they're all gone, she said adding, \"I need to go to Walmart after school.\"Adjusting lessons for younger students, too For younger children in elementary school, teachers are also doing a fair amount of listening and then adjusting of lesson plans. At an elementary AltSchool in San Francisco, part of a network of progressive schools in California and New York, students wrote down what they were feeling after the election.\"I'm sad that Donald Trump is president. I think he's happy. I think Hillary Clinton is sad,\" wrote one little girl, according to Maggie Quale, director of communications for AltSchools.Asked why she thought Trump won, the little girl had said, \"I don't think he followed the directions. He should not have won,\" said Quale. The teachers were hearing that over and over again from the kids, that Trump doesn't follow the rules and how can somebody win who doesn't follow the rules, she said.At the school, teachers are now starting to do a lesson on rules, such as how do they create their own classroom rules, what happens when people don't follow rules and what happens when the person in charge doesn't follow them.In Chicago, at Northside Catholic Academy, first grade teacher Raven Krupa decided to read a book to her students: \"So You Want to be President,\" by Judith St. George. \"I felt compelled to make sure they could learn from the election and move forward in a positive, productive manner,\" said Krupa in an email to CNN. \"I think that's why I chose to read them a story about how they could become president one day.\" To Krupa, it wasn't about dwelling on the past or airing anger, but instead about thinking more productively and compelling her students to be agents of change. She thinks reading the book helped mend a lot of wounds and get past their feelings and continues to use other moments, when they come up, to continue the discussion.\"There have been times where I've had my interactive projector on to pull up a math lesson and the news feed on my web browser shows a picture of Trump and I'll hear a couple of kids sort of growl or say, 'I don't like him.' \" said Krupa. \"But even those moments are an opportunity to take the Catholic approach of respecting others no matter what differences we have and reminding them that they can be the change that this world needs by becoming president one day.\"'Everything is going to be just fine'At Lander-Grinspoon Academy, a Jewish day school in Northhampton, Massachusetts, administrators opened the library to parents the first three mornings after the election and invited some local rabbis to be on hand, said Deborah Bromberg Seltzer, the school's principal.Immediately after the election, teachers also spoke to students in a wide-ranging way depending on who the kids were and their ages, she said. The entire school community of 65 students gathered at the end of the day for an assembly  to sing folk songs and other \"just good feeling\" songs, said Bromberg Seltzer. The school also sponsored a concert on the weekend after the election by a local band, which performed for the community as a way to rally around supporting minorities and any people who felt threatened.Even in western Massachusetts, a predominantly liberal area, there has been an upsurge in hate crimes or hateful incidents since the election. The crimes have been directed at African Americans, Muslims, Jews and Asians, said the principal.\"I think people feel disappointed but I think also feel scared,\" she said. \"Because we're a school of minority students with a fairly high lesbian population, people feel scared.\"Because of that fear and uncertainty over what is to come, educators see their role in calming and guiding students, and helping them lead a respective discourse, as more important than ever.\"We have arrived at this place in our country where there's a lack of mutual understanding and I think it is really important for us as educators to help young people develop their skills at having reasoned and substantive conversations about complicated things,\" said Frailey, of Seattle Girls' School. \"Our middle schoolers, they're just getting to that place developmentally where they can really dig in to complicated topics and we're trying to help them do that.\"Her colleague Leaks added, \"We're trying to teach kids that we individually have a responsibility to engage so that people aren't standing on islands by themselves be that because they have difference that's based in their sexual identity or gender expression or their race or their religion.\"The day after Witherspoon of Evanston Township High School delivered his remarks, members of the South Asian Club at the school decided to give out free hugs.Witherspoon says educators, more than ever, can play a crucial role in helping students feel less despair and more hopeful.\"No matter how much we might get embroiled in current events and embroiled in partisan politics, I think that ... we just want to be optimistic about our future, that's what America is, that's what democracy's about, that's what human beings,\" are about, he said. \"I think in the end it's like yes, these are words of love and belonging and in a sense, everything is going to be just fine.\"Have you heard any unique ways teachers are trying to bring students together post-election?

{"_id":"Scientists find the first fossilized dinosaur brain - but what took so long? ","articleText":" (CNN)A little over 130 million years ago, a plant-eating dinosaur was roaming the present-day area of Sussex, England, when -- trapped by the muds of a thick swamp -- it fell backward to his death and was forgotten. Until today.Its brain -- almost dismissed as another shiny brown pebble along the British coastline -- has just been officially identified as the first preserved dinosaur brain in history.Dr. David Norman, a British palaeontologist from the University of Cambridge's Department of Earth, is part of the team of international researchers who analyzed the fossil found in 2004 by amateur fossil hunter Jamie Hiscocks in Surrey, England.For Norman, trying to understand how the dinosaur, known to science as Bexhill iguanodontian, died was key to understanding how the brain was preserved. \"Of course, dinosaurs have brains. But this discovery is amazing, in itself,because of the rarity of preserving soft-tissue in terrain animals because they decay so quickly,\" he told CNN.\"In a way it is like recreating a forensic scene. How could the brain have been preserved? You have a dead body and you have to explain how it got there,\" he said.The researcher believes the fossil, which shows similarities to the brains of present-day crocodiles and birds, was preserved due to the dinosaur dying in a swamp-like environment which mixed low levels of oxygen -- known to slow decay -- and acidity which can preserve soft tissue for long periods.The size of the brainWhile the fossilized brain fits in a closed hand, its size is also raising attention as it is considered large for the herbivorous dinosaur that it belongs to.The size most likely comes from the way the species died.\"The fossil we have almost seems as it belonged to a mammal. However we have to remember that when the brain collapsed -- as the dinosaur died -- and the membranes were likely squashed, under gravity, which has led to the denser volume,\" Norman said.The shiny structuresNorman still remembers being excited when his late co-researcher, Professor Martin Brasier of the University of Oxford, first showed him the fossil in 2006. \"It was Martin, who first noticed the fossil's shiny surface. When I saw it, and I noticed the surface also showed wrinkles in its fabric similar to membranes, I got excited. We both did. Proving the fossil was from a dinosaur's brain was a long, but rewarding, process,\" he said. According to the palaeontologist, it is easy to dismiss shiny membranes in fossils as material that needs to be cleaned out.\"But now researchers can go back and look at other fossils and pay closer attention to any shiny features. While these might normally be dismissed as dirt, and something to remove, they might be preserved soft tissue.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/health/fossil-brain-cambridge-trnd/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sec. Kerry says Trump did not contact State Dept. prior to calls","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday he's trying to stay \"a thousand miles away from the (Donald) Trump transition process\" while acknowledging neither the President-elect nor his transition team have consulted with the State Department prior to Trump's calls with foreign leaders.President-elect Trump broke with decades' worth of US diplomatic protocol last week when he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen by phone. China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, accordingly, the US doesn't recognize Taiwan as a country.The call risks damaging US-China relations and indeed, China's foreign ministry lodged a formal complaint with the US on Saturday.But questions remain as to whether the call signaled a foreign policy shift in a new administration or a blunder by an inexperienced politician and transition staff.Vice President-elect Mike Pence has utilized State Department briefings ahead of calls with foreign leaders but, according to Kerry, Trump himself has not.\"We have not been contacted before any of these conversations. We have not been requested to provide talking points,\" Kerry said at the Saban Forum in Washington.\"I do think there's a value, obviously, on having at least the recommendations, whether you choose to follow them or not is a different issue, but I think it's valuable to ask people who've worked the desk and have worked it for a long period of time their input on what's the current state, is there some particular issue at the moment. I think that's valuable and I would certainly recommend it, but obviously that hasn't happened in a few cases.\"RELATED: Donald Trump's dramatic search for a secretary of stateBut Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway did say last week that Trump does consult with briefing materials provided by the State Department.\"He reads everything. He's the busiest guy on the planet. Pretty much has been for a while now,\" Conway told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\"He avails himself of any number of different information sources, including those that come from the State Department and including those that come from intelligence briefings.\"Kerry did say he was hopeful communication between the State Department and the transition team would increase once they name a nominee for secretary of state. In the meantime, Kerry said he didn't want to get into the politics.\"I'm really consciously working to stay a thousand miles away from the Trump transition process. I think it's important for me to be able to brief whoever the final nominee is going to be for secretary of state and I don't want to come at it with any engagements with any of the choices they are making publicly -- I really think it's better for me to stay out of the politics which I stayed out of for the four years,\" Kerry said.But without mentioning Trump by name last week, Kerry, a former Naval officer and vocal critic of the Vietnam War, said complex international issues boil down to more than just \"little pithy tweets.\" \"We're going to have one hell of a debate over the next few years, I can assure you,\" Kerry said. \"And I can promise you this, after coming back in the 1960's and being involved in that period of time, I am not going to go quietly into the night.\"CNN Global Affairs Correspondent Elise Labott contributed to this report","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/04/politics/john-kerry-donald-trump-state-department/index.html"}
{"_id":"Secret Service considering renting a floor at Trump Tower to protect future first family","articleText":" (CNN)The US Secret Service is considering renting one floor in Trump Tower to protect President-elect Donald Trump and his family by turning it into a 24-7 command post, a law enforcement official told CNN Friday.According to Jared Horowitz, who is with Newmark Grubb Knight Frank and responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent with the average floor office space running between 13,500 square feet to 15,500 square feet cost about $1.5 million a year.The law enforcement official says the current plans for security at Trump Tower would differ if the future first family were living at the White House full time and Trump's wife Melania and their son Barron were not staying behind in New York City through the Spring.Once the Trumps live at the White House full time the USSS will have to reassess what kind of a security presence will be needed at Trump Tower, depending on how often Trump and his family return to New York City.The official says this kind of planning is typical for the Secret Service after every election but \"what is unordinary is that the President Elect lives on 5th Avenue.\"What is also unprecedented is that the building is owned by the Trump Corporation so the USSS would be renting the space from Trump's company for protecting him and his family.Donald Trump's first 100 days: A breakdown of his planThe official said a lot of details still need to be ironed out and the security plan is \"evolving every day.\" As of now, this official adds more than 100 USSS personnel would be needed for the 24-7 shifts to protect the future First Family.New York City Police Department would also be a part of the security detail, mostly being used to secure the streets around the building. A separate law enforcement official said the number of NYPD cops protecting Trump Tower could grow to 300 at a cost of about $1 million a day. The official saying a separate command might be needed just to focus on security for the future President.The USSS would be primarily responsible for protecting the residence and the NYPD primarily responsible for outside security.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Ron Kessler, an expert on the US Secret Service,  says it is \"standard for the Secret Service to have these kinds of costs.\" It's a practice that he says goes back at least to Richard Nixon administration.And he says that in the end it may actually \"save the government money\" because without renting space agents working to protect the President-elect could be staying in hotels. By renting at Trump Tower they can live in the building during the Trump presidency.Kessler says he is not sure who negotiates the real estate contracts but that Government's General Services Administration could be involved.Kessler says VP Joe Biden has a habit if traveling back and forth between Washington and Wilmington, Delaware, several times a week, which has increased costs of his protection.The USSS declined to comment on security precautions being taken for Trump and his family. The New York Post first reported that the USSS was eying two floors at Trump Tower to provide security for the President-elect and his family.CNN's Joe Johns contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/politics/secret-service-trump-tower/index.html"}

{"_id":"Senate Dems, powerless to stop Trump nominees, regret 'nuclear option' power play","articleText":" (CNN)Senate Democrats are eager to make Donald Trump pay a political price for nominating staunch conservatives to fill out his Cabinet, hoping to exact revenge for the GOP's stubborn opposition to President Barack Obama's nominees.But there is little they can do about it -- and some top Democrats are now coming to regret it.That's because Senate Democrats muscled through an unprecedented rules change in 2013 to weaken the power of the minority party to filibuster Cabinet-level appointees and most judicial nominees, now setting the threshold at 51 votes -- rather than 60 -- to overcome tactics aimed at derailing nominations.With the Senate GOP poised to hold 52 seats next Congress, some Democrats now say they should have thought twice before making the rules change -- known on Capitol Hill as the \"nuclear option.\"\"I do regret that,\" said Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat who voted for the rules change three years ago. \"I frankly think many of us will regret that in this Congress because it would have been a terrific speed bump, potential emergency break, to have in our system to slow down nominees.\"With their power weakened, Democrats are weighing how to make life difficult for the Senate GOP. They are planning on making the fight over Rep. Tom Price's nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department a proxy war over the GOP's plans to to dramatically overhaul Medicare. They want to turn Steven Mnuchin's nomination to lead the Treasury into a battle over regulating Wall Street. And they want to make Sen. Jeff Sessions answer for his hard-line stands on civil rights issues and against comprehensive immigration reform. Senate Democrats plan to make speeches and mount objections to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's efforts to quickly schedule votes to confirm much of Trump's Cabinet by the time he is inaugurated in January. Under the rules, they could delay votes from taking place for a few days at a time, temporarily slowing down the Trump agenda.But they ultimately won't be able to stop those nominees -- unless Republicans defect and join the Democratic opposition. And that fact has begun to grate at Democrats, who have complained bitterly at Republicans' stands against Obama's nominees -- most notably their unprecedented refusal to even give the President's Supreme Court choice, Merrick Garland, a hearing.Some Democrats realize they've made life harder for themselves.\"In specific circumstances, we may regret that we can't block a nomination,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. \"But I think that the American people want action, and they want the process to work. And they want the folks whom they have elected to actually do the job and get stuff done.\"One person who seems to be having buyer's remorse over the change in filibuster rules: Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader. Schumer told The Washington Post last month that he privately lobbied Senate Democrats in 2013 to maintain the 60-vote threshold for Cabinet-level nominees, but: \"I didn't prevail.\"Asked twice at a news conference last week, Schumer declined to say if he thought invoking the nuclear option was a mistake. He instead sharply criticized Price's views on Medicare, and said, \"That's all I'm going to say.\"Schumer weighed in Monday on one example where Democrats' hands are apparently tied on a nominee they disapprove of: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who was picked by Trump to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"I have serious concerns about Dr. Carson's lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Someone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for Housing Secretary, to say the least.\"The man who pushed through the rules change -- retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid -- said he has no qualms for making that change, pointing to how the GOP was holding up Obama nominees at all levels, notably the DC Appeals Court.\"Yes, we changed the rules,\" Reid said last week. \"We had to change rules because we now have a DC Circuit that functions, we've got 98 judges, and we have a functioning National Labor Relations Board .... And remember, with now 48 senators, we only need to pick up a few Republicans of goodwill to stop some of these nominations.\"Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a champion in the push to reform the filibuster, said, \"I have absolutely no regret\" in invoking the nuclear option.One area where Senate Democrats do hold power over Trump is his nomination of Gen. James Mattis to lead the Defense Department. That's because Congress needs to approve a waiver allowing him to serve in that capacity since his 2013 retirement from the Marines is within a seven-year waiting period required for active duty personnel from taking the top civilian post. Senate Democrats can mount a filibuster, requiring 60 votes in the Senate for approval.Schumer has not yet taken a position on the waiver. And a senior Senate Democratic aide said that many in the caucus would not be comfortable granting a waiver before fully assessing Mattis' views.In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi came out Tuesday against fast-tracking the waiver, as did Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee.But if the waiver is approved, Mattis -- like other Cabinet-level nominees -- would only need GOP support to get confirmed lead the Pentagon.When he pushed through the changes in 2013, Reid said the GOP would benefit as well.\"The changes that we made today will apply equally to both parties,\" Reid said at the time. \"When Republicans are in power, these changes will apply to them as well. That's simple fairness. And it's something both sides should be willing to live with to make Washington work again, that is also simple fairness.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/senate-democrats-nuclear-option-donald-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"Senate holds emotional vote to rename cancer bill after Joe Biden's late son, Beau","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The Senate voted Monday to rename a bill aimed to accelerate cancer research after Joe Biden's late son, Beau Biden, in an emotional session which the vice president presided over. Beau Biden died in 2015 at age 46 after battling brain cancer. Since his death, his father spearheaded efforts to fight cancer, which included a bill that would make therapies available to more patients, while also improving the ability to prevent cancer and detect it at an early stage.Biden presided over the session and appeared to grow emotional over the tributes to his son. \"Today, the Senate would like to specifically acknowledge (Biden's) efforts to help Americans struggling with cancer,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in the Senate chamber. \"He's known the cruel toll this disease can take. But he hasn't let it defeat him. He's chosen to fight back. He's taken a leading role. And the Senate will soon pass the 21st Century Cures Act as a testament to his tremendous effort.\"White House: Trump Taiwan call could 'undermine' progressMcConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said that the senators wanted to name the bill after Beau Biden because of Joe Biden's efforts to fund cancer research after his son's death.\"I think it's fitting to dedicate this bill's critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who would be proud of the presiding officer today -- and that's his son, Beau,\" McConnell said. \"And in just a moment that's exactly what the Senate will do. Renaming the (National Institutes of Health)'s cancer initiatives in this bill after Beau Biden.\"Later, McConnell asked formally in the chamber that the bill be renamed after Beau Biden.\"Without objection,\" the vice president said, with his voice quivering and his eyes tearing up.If passed, the bill will provide hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to research cancer.CNN's Ted Barrett and Terence Burlij contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/joe-biden-cancer-mitch-mcconnell-beau-biden/index.html"}
{"_id":"Sending selfies just got easier: In Africa's 2G mobile economy, 4G is expanding fast","articleText":"Béchir Abba-Goni is a Postdoctoral researcher in Management Science at Université Aube Nouvelle and Marc Bidan is a Professor of Information Systems Management at Université de Nantes. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. This article was originally published in French, and has been produced and translated into English solely by The Conversation. (CNN)Africa's mobile market, second only to that of the Asia-Pacific region, has huge potential for growth.Figures published by the global GSM Association in Tanzania are breathtaking. Every five years, the group collects data from its 800 network carriers. Putting these figures together with research carried out in the Sahel region provides an illuminating picture of mobile use across the continent.According to the GSMA report, by the end of 2015, nearly half of the 1.17 billion-strong African population (557 million people) had some kind of mobile phone plan. They now amount to 12% of all individual subscribers in the world, and make up 6% of global revenue -- a 70% increase when compared to figures published by the same source just five years earlier.Two main user characteristics emerge from studies carried out in the field. First, users favor pre-paid packages. Second, each subscriber owns 1.92 SIM cards on average.Setting aside the problems this poses for identification and traceability, and the resulting complications for operators, this means that the market for SIM cards is huge -- almost a billion units (965 million) at the end of 2015, and an estimated 1.3 billion by the end of 2020.This spectacular growth in demand should result in 730 million individual subscribers by 2020. Unsurprisingly, the figures vary widely from country to country. For instance, data from 2014 shows that the top five countries (Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo) account for about 44% of the total, while the bottom 30 countries only make up 10%.Similarly, the actual rate of overall market penetration for SIM cards amongst people aged 15 and over is 67% (taking into account those who own several cards); some countries (Mali, Gambia, Gabon and Botswana) boast a rate of more than 100%.Landlines met with little success (because customer experience left much to be desired) over the second half of the 20th century, and this seems to have boosted demand for mobile phones. This means mobile use today is inversely related to that of landlines in the past.In a 2G continent, 4G is expanding fastThe African market remains largely dominated by 2G packages, but high-speed mobile connections (4G/LTE) are gaining ground. In 2015, 46/LTE represented 25% of the market; this will rise to an estimated 60% by 2020.Half of the 4G networks currently in use are less than two years old and 4G has just been made available in 24 countries.Smartphone sales now account for 23% of the mobile phone market. These sales are set to increase as infrastructure is modernized and network coverage improves, as are those of low-cost and counterfeit phones from Asia that are flooding the market across the entire continent due to ever lower prices. Currently, these low-cost phone make up 50% of the market.Potential growth in revenue per subscriber remains high, especially when compared with figures from Europe or North America, but it is dependent upon a wider range of options, better network coverage and improved service quality. Estimated revenue for an average African subscriber is €8 per month [$8.44] (ranging from €2 in Ethiopia to €28 in Gabon[$29.56]), against €27 per month in Europe and €53 [$55.94] per month in North America.A 2013 report had already shown the high potential for mobiles, their ecosystem and their contribution, both direct and indirect, to growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.In 2012, for example, economic activity related to mobile phones and their life-cycle accounted for about 3.3 million jobs and 6.3% of the region's GDP, while market penetration was less than 40%. This demonstrates a massive potential for growth, with the arrival of 4G-LTE networks (although prices are still prohibitive for most users).This robust activity comes with its own characteristics, chiefly arising from Africa's substantial informal economy (which, as a side note, is shamelessly exploited by developed countries). Just look at how easy it is to repair a smartphone, by virtue of some creative handiwork in markets and souks like the one at Derb Ghallef in Morocco.This does not translate to the phones being easily recycable, however. Phones are mainly disposed of in landfills and unauthorized markets like that of Agbogbloshie in Ghana. At a time when Africa is hosting the COP22, we must bring attention to the sector's catastrophic social and environmental impact.Gaps in the marketAfrican consumers, like those across the world, are demanding and informed. They want clear, reliable, smooth running mobile solutions, especially as a way to compensate for the continent's real -- or perceived -- shortfalls. They have appropriated the technology in innovative ways (beeping, flashing, credit transfer).Aside from network reliability, consumer demand centers around messaging, sound quality, data and ease of communication, but also e-payment, e-insurance and e-learning. Users can thus circumvent the banking and administrative red tape that is partly responsible for the seldom used formal banking system.From the electronic purse to secure commercial transactions to group savings systems, the growth of mobile banking in Africa, like that of all developing regions, is extraordinary. Consider, for instance, the amazing success of the shopping and bill settling solutions offered by M-PESA in Kenya, or the market penetration of mobile insurance solutions, mobile learning and distance education.But consumer appetite for mobile phones is sometimes plainly stifled. Several factors explain this phenomenon, despite the general consensus that the technology contributes to development. Simply consider the lack of coverage, where vast rural areas are still under-serviced, or the inadequate pricing offers, given the continent's weak buying power. The unreliability of operators due to technical, financial or structural problems explains why there is an average of two SIM cards per person on the continent, and the popularity of mobiles with dual SIM capacity.We could also mention Africa's low literacy rate, or consumer reticence due to the apparent complexity of learning about, and using, information technology (despite the youth and creativity of most of the potential users).The range of applications available is still largely inconsistent with the actual needs -- be they to do with agriculture, education, health, food or services -- of a large and disadvantaged proportion of the population. Few are available in the customers' regional and national languages.Supply is rapidly adaptingUnsurprisingly, given that it represents operators, manufacturers and other producers, GSMA stresses the importance of a new regulatory framework for the digital ecosystem, underscoring the detrimental effect that taxes are having on the development of mobile services in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Tanzania and Tunisia, notably.In its July 2016 report, the group also stated that operators' profit margins will only decline as markets become increasingly aggressive and network investment capacities are falling. The fact that EBITDA margins, which hovered around 40% in 2010, will likely decrease to around 30% by 2020, illustrates the need to address questions about the sector's profitability, although the outlook for total revenue remains optimistic ($153 billion in 2015, rising to $210 billion by 2020.)GSMA also highlights upcoming opportunities and challenges. First of all, opportunities for telecommunication operators to provide security, distribution and value-creation (monetizing data content) for data collected across the entire continent. There are also significant opportunities provided by the increasing, but still modest, rise of platform solutions for B2B transactions.Digital transformation is inevitableIn addition to clients and regulatory authorities, the GSMA sees the cost of licensing and taxes on imports such as mobile phone accessories (cables, headphones, cameras, flash disks and so on) as a challenge that will be counterproductive to growth in the sector.It also highlights the lack of clarity surrounding taxation and national legislation, which deters many transnational investors, and the immaturity of regulators, which hinders the harmonization and allocation of terrestrial frequencies.It seems clear that the digital recycling sector, relating to the life-cycle of all high-tech products, must be completely re-examined, cleaned up, made viable and profitable in the long run throughout the continent. Digital technology in Africa can and should be sustainable.The African continent has the most remarkable potential for growth, creativity and transformation, such as the silicon mountain of Africa in Cameroon.The issues and challenges are as vast as Africa itself. Let us hope that the key players in this inevitable, irreversible and accelerating transformation won't lose sight of the human aspect.Translated from the French by Alice Heathwood, Fast for Word.Copyright 2016 The Conversation.

{"_id":"Separated twins: After hardest surgery, the quickest recovery","articleText":"New York (CNN)The white dressing covering Jadon's head is gently unwrapped, revealing a perfectly shaped head and a hairline with a natural curl. It's the first time his parents have seen him without his bandages in four weeks. That's when he and his twin brother, Anias, born conjoined at the head, were separated in a 27-hour surgery at the Children's Hospital at Montifiore Medical Center in the Bronx.Mother Nicole McDonald stands at his bedside in awe. Although new bandages will be put on, the sight is breathtaking. \"It's the most amazing thing. I just can't even believe it,\" she says. \"And look at his little hair. On top, it's growing in!\"His father, Christian McDonald, leans in. \"Hey there, my man,\" he says, \"You sure are handsome. Look at you. You look like a perfect little boy.\"Jadon stares up at them, waving his right hand. He then taps the top of his head. \"How does it feel to be your own little boy?\" Dad asks. Mom mimics her son, touching her own head and, imagining what he's thinking, asks, \"Where's my brother?\"Anias rests in his bed across the room, near a window. His head remains wrapped. \"You've been having a tougher go of it, but you're going to get through it,\" Dad tells him. The boys, now 14 months old, are set to move to rehab shortly after Thanksgiving, about six weeks after the surgery to separate them. The world's previous record for recovery from such an operation, known as craniopagus surgery, was eight weeks. Many separated twins remain hospitalized for months.Lead surgeon Dr. James Goodrich is checking on the twins in their 10th floor room on a rainy, unseasonably warm November afternoon. He's considered the leading expert in the world on twins conjoined at the head, and this was his seventh craniopagus operation. But it was also his most complicated: the boys' brains so intertwined, Goodrich considered stopping hours into the operation. \"Historically, this will be the fastest (recovery),\" Goodrich says at Jadon's bedside.\"I didn't know that,\" Nicole responds. \"So they were maybe your hardest set, but the fastest ones out of the hospital.\"Goodrich nods. He attributes their remarkable recovery to one thing: \"Just good kids.\" The surgeon marvels at how well Jadon and Anias are doing. \"I'm the least complaining person in this room,\" he says. \"When they're ahead of schedule, it makes everyone happy.\"Jadon is a bundle of energy -- \"a crazy wild man,\" in his mother's words. He chews on wires. He reaches for faces. He locks onto a gaze and smiles. He tugs at the dressing when it's covering his head. It seems he can hardly be confined to his bed. With twins joined at the head, Goodrich explains, there's always a dominant child where one child does double the work, that child's heart and lungs working overtime to keep both boys alive. In this case, Anias is the non-dominant child who has struggled with breathing and eating, even prior to the surgery. But Anias is progressing well, the doctors say, getting stronger since the surgery.He often shrinks when people in scrubs approach, as if fearful he might have to undergo another surgery. Yet this day, Anias lets loose a smile as those in scrubs come near. \"I like that he's starting to smile at other people,\" Nicole says. \"He's starting to trust people.\"He blinks his long lashes, stares up and tracks his mom with his deep brown eyes. He doesn't have the same range of motions as Jadon, but the surgical staff believes he will get there. The boys' next stop will be a nearby rehabilitation center where they will undergo months of therapy. They've never crawled or lifted their heads like typical 1-year-olds -- let alone attempted to walk. The surgery sets them back to infancy, Goodrich says, and it will take time for them to reach those milestones. Their mother, a pediatric physical therapist, has helped prepare them well for this next phase, Goodrich says. Goodrich believes Jadon is ready for rehab now, but it's more beneficial for him to stay in the same room with his brother. \"Separating the two,\" he says with a tinge of irony, \"is probably not a good idea at this point.\" A photograph captures the moment when the two boys saw each other for the first time in the hospital. They both have quizzical yet awe-inspiring looks on their faces, as if to say, \"How's it going over there?\" Their room is situated in a corner, with windows facing Manhattan's majestic skyline. The walls are a pale blue, and the boys' names hang above their beds. A cutout of a cartoon lion designates Anias; a giraffe watches over Jadon.A poem attached to Jadon's monitor reads:I'm your twinYou're my twinWe stick together through thick and thinNo matter what I doI'm always stuck with you.In this same room, the night before surgery, Jadon held a book in front of his face, and Anias reached up to tug on it. Jadon snatched it away and shoved at his brother's hands. And that's how the boys interacted: confined to the same bed at all times. Their parents could rarely pick them up or give one child their full attention. They had to stand over the boys, glancing back at forth at the two of them.To see the boys now is stunning. Their cognitive functions are remarkable, considering the traumatic surgery they underwent. Little miracles, Nicole calls them. Yet the past weeks have been grueling, for the boys and for their parents. Jadon struggled with infections, fevers and breathing. The left side of his body was initially paralyzed, but he has since begun moving it. He had one seizure that seemed to come out of nowhere two weeks ago. Both boys struggled with infections beneath their scalps, resulting in several trips to the operating room to clean out the wounds. For Anias, doctors had to remove the skull cap they'd fashioned out of extra bone from the boys' conjoined skull. For now, his scalp is the only thing covering the top of his head. Recent skin grafts to help cover his scalp have left him in excruciating pain, although pain medication has helped to ease it. Lead plastic surgeon Dr. Oren Tepper says Anias will eventually have to undergo more surgery to try to fashion a new skull cap out of bone from his hip or rib. But that is years down the road. He can survive fine as he is but will wear a protective helmet as a safety precaution, possibly for as long as seven years until the surgery. Both boys will be outfitted with helmets before going into rehab. \"It hasn't been perfect, but I think perfection in this case was never really an option,\" Tepper says. For now, he says, both boys are \"way ahead of schedule. They're really doing a lot better than I hoped. \"The whole world has gotten behind these kids.\"Anias also has suffered from multiple seizures, which are kept in check with medication. Goodrich says that's not uncommon after craniopagus surgery.  \"You can't cut the brain, disrupt it, and not have some consequences,\" he says. The non-dominant child in these cases, he adds, \"just takes longer\" to recover.Tepper says the thing that surprises him the most is that Anias, despite his setbacks, has gotten stronger since the surgery. \"In a way, kind of staying conjoined and attached was inhibiting him and not letting his body recover and do the things he was capable of doing.\"But when they got separated,\" Tepper says, \"it was time for him to fly on his own -- and he's doing just that.\"Goodrich says he's most inspired by Jadon's spontaneity, how he tugs at stuff and reaches for people. \"Nobody is forcing him. Nobody is telling him to do it. He's very spontaneous, and that to me is the most encouraging.\"At Jadon's bedside with Nicole, Goodrich recalls the most difficult moment of the surgery, when he considered stopping because the boys' blood vessels were so intricately tied together. \"I was afraid by clamping those veins, if any one of them ruptured, that's how you lose a child,\" he says.But he says a moment of opportunity arose -- \"a little hole to work through.\" The doctor proceeded, making the correct move to separate the boys.  \"(If we) made the wrong one, we wouldn't be having this conversation,\" he tells Nicole.Again, Jadon smiles.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/health/conjoined-twins-month-later-recovery/index.html"}
{"_id":"Serving up healthy meals and hope","articleText":"Sebastopol, California (CNN)Cathryn Couch believes in the power of food to help people heal. It's something the professional chef discovered 10 years ago.Couch was asked to teach her friend's teenage daughter how to cook. So she turned the culinary lessons into a unique summer project: preparing healthy meals for three families dealing with a serious health crisis. In one of them, a mother of two had stage 4 breast cancer.\"In that situation, everyone is terrified and the parent who is well has this enormous burden of caregiving and working to support the family,\" Couch said. \"I realized that the food was a vehicle to help relieve some of that stress.\"Couch has since expanded the idea into her nonprofit, the Ceres Community Project, which has nourished the bodies and souls of thousands of low-income people facing cancer and other serious illness in northern California.At the heart of the work are local teens. They volunteer after school in four commercial kitchens—in Sonoma, Marin and Alameda counties—preparing 100% organic meals for clients and their families.The organization also has a leadership training and gardening program, where teens raise about 5,000 pounds of food every year.\"Youth are our future,\" Couch said. \"If we give them the skills to make healthy choices for themselves and connect them to the power of community service, we're shaping a healthier future for our communities and for them personally.\"Since 2007, the Ceres Community Project has trained more than 2,000 young volunteers and delivered more than 450,000 healthy meals to sick residents.CNN's Marissa Calhoun spoke with Couch about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: Cancer patients need all kinds of support. Why did you choose to focus on food? Couch: One of the things that happens when people get sick is that there's all kinds of appointments they have to go to. Their life becomes very complicated. And with cancer, there's also really significant impacts on people's appetite.So we focus on feeding them because we know that up to 80% of cancer patients end up being malnourished—and if they're malnourished, they have worse side effects, they have worse treatment outcomes and they have longer recovery times.Food is really critical for cancer, but also for most illnesses. And yet, it tends to drop to the bottom of the priority list. By providing healthy, organic meals, we're really making a difference in people's lives.We provide food to the whole family because we know that helps relieve the most stress, and also because everybody then learns about eating healthy food and gets excited about that. CNN: Why is it important to you to have youth take the lead in the program?Couch: I think that the teenage years are the most challenging, and I have an enormous amount of compassion for who young people are. I think we completely undervalue them in our society. I've been stunned to see who they blossom into through our program. But also it's been amazing to observe how hungry they are for an opportunity to make a difference.We jokingly say youth come to Ceres for all kinds of reasons: They have to do community service hours. Their parents think it's a good idea for them. Their friend is working there. But no matter why they come, we find that they choose to stay on their own. The truth is, youth have the same deep longing that we all do—to be valued and to belong to their communities. CNN: Aside from gaining cooking skills, how have you seen the youth benefit from this experience? Couch: One of the most important things that happens for young people in the program is that clients come to visit, and they get to really feel the impact that they're making. It's very different to see a name on a container and to know abstractly that you're cooking for someone in need. But when you're sitting across from that person and you hear their story and you hear everything they're struggling with, and then they thank you personally for being there and for making this happen for them—it really shifts how you see yourself. That's the transformation that every young person in our program has an opportunity to go through. Want to get involved? Check out the Ceres Community Project website and see how to help.

{"_id":"Sexual assault: Changing the conversation before college","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)In a striking new public service announcement trying to change the conversation about sexual assault, tween, teen and college students, girls and boys, women and men, look directly at the camera and don't say a word. Instead, they hold up posters with statements that speak volumes about the messages society has been sending for far too long.\"How much did you drink?\" reads the sign one teenage girl is holding.Other posters include statements and questions such as \"Don't wear short skirts\" and \"Were you drunk?\"A teenage boy holds up a sign that reads, \"She was 'asking for it.' \"Cece, a 17-year-old high school senior, is showcased with a sign that asks, \"Well, what were you wearing that night?\"\"To me those messages mean that ... I was created to be a sexual object, something to be acted upon but not meant to act myself, not meant to fight back -- to have a voice, to be empowered. But mostly that I do not deserve justice,\" Cece said in an email interview. (The creators of the video do not share the last names of the children who participated for privacy and security reasons. No children in the video are victims of sexual assault.)We often forget or fail to recognize that words are just as harmful as institutions, Cece said. Comments such as the ones in the video represent a form of \"systematic oppression,\" she believes.\"We beat girls down until they become too afraid to report the sexual assault because of the shame that comes with being violated,\" she said. \"Meanwhile, we do not guilt boys for being sexual assaulters.\"Can I remind you that Cece is just 17 and has not even entered college yet? If girls and boys her age and younger get this message before they start college, think about how much more aware they will be about sexual assault before they get to campus, how supportive they will be of survivors and how empowered they will be to stand up and intervene if they witness dangerous behavior.That's the thinking behind the new public service announcement created pro bono by SheKnows Media, a leading women's lifestyle digital media company, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a private nonprofit organization focusing on key issues, for the second anniversary of It's On Us. It's On Us, created as part of a White House initiative in 2014, is now a public-private partnership that seeks to fundamentally change how we think and talk about sexual assault.The message of the video is really about the need to dramatically change the conversation about sexual assault, said Rebecca Kaplan, director of It's On Us.\"We see that this has been so culturally ingrained because starting at the age of 2, starting at the age of 4, little boys are told to 'man up.' We're seeing that young girls who are 7 are being told not to wear short skirts. So that victim-blaming culture really needs to stop, and it needs to start early,\" said Kaplan, who has been with It's On Us since it was founded.The video featured tween, teen and college students who are part of SheKnows Media's Hatch program, which aims to teach media literacy to young people and empower them to create content around issues they care about.'Boys will be boys'Eleven-year-old Finn, a sixth-grader and a member of the Hatch program, participated in the video and held up signs that read, \"Be Aggressive,\" \"Boys will be boys\" and \"Don't act like a girl.\"\"Sometimes I hear older boys say, 'Don't act like a girl,' \" Finn said. \"We are being told as boys to act a certain way.\"Messages such as \"Boys will be boys\" can be incredibly damaging because those statements \"sort of excuse\" behavior that is inappropriate, said Kaplan. \"So when we do that for ... even for small things, it does create this culture of not respecting each other, not respecting each other's space, and that turns into the rape culture that we have today.\"Getting boys and men involved in the conversation is critical, said Kaplan.\"This is really an everyone issue. It's not just a women's issue. And so I think it's really important to see young men, old men, all men having this conversation, being present and showing their support,\" she said. \"I mean, we hear all the time we can't have equality if men's voices are not supporting that.\"Since It's On Us was founded, more than 360,000 people have taken its pledge to help end sexual assault. There have been 1,400 events at more than 530 college campuses across the country, according to Kaplan.Those events focus on training, raising awareness and sparking conversations around consent, supporting survivors and bystander intervention.'Educate, engage and empower'The issue hits very close to home for Kaplan. Eight years ago, during her freshman year of college, a close friend was sexually assaulted. \"What came of that situation is, when she did finally come forward, I had no idea what to do,\" she said. \"I had no idea where she could go. I had no idea what the options were. People just weren't talking about it like they are (today).\"For too long, sexual assault has been an issue that was the burden of survivors alone, she said. \"There's a lot of internal victim-blaming, not to mention external victim-blaming, and so we're really at the point today where, unfortunately, this is such a prevalent issue, and the only way to prevent it is to educate, engage and empower everyone to be a part of the solution.\"That means being active bystanders and not being afraid to step in and speak up if you see something that does not seem quite right, she said. Kaplan points to the case of a Florida football player working as a bouncer this summer, who, along with a co-worker, stepped in to stop an alleged rape behind the Gainesville bar where they worked.\"Those small acts of bravery are not only the right thing to do, they're the cool thing to do,\" she said. \"We live in a culture, oftentimes, where people are just kind of like, 'Mind your own business; don't get involved,' and that shouldn't be the case.\"In a way, everyone in the new video acted as bystanders, said Cece, the high school senior.\"The significance of us holding up those signs and saying, 'We see you,' just by looking into the camera, is our way of highlighting that it really is on all of us,\" she said. \"That this is not just a problem for the person who has been raped or assaulted, this is universal. It's our way of taking some of that weight off of the victim and placing it on our own shoulders. The video says that we hear you, and we are here for you.\"The hope now is that the video, which is being showcased across the digital platforms of SheKnows Media, the Ad Council and It's On Us, is watched and shared far and wide by tweens, teens and college students.\"It's also just really important to get ... teens involved and talking about it at an early age,\" said Megan Sigesmund, vice president of campaign management and external affairs for the Ad Council.For Kaplan, thoughts of her close friend and what she experienced her first year of college drive her to keep the conversation moving.\"For me, this is really justice for her, to a certain degree,\" she said. \"Seeing how the movement has changed and how much more open we are and how we're really working together to change this has been very inspiring, and it is a little bit of justice for her. That's what keeps me going.\"What do you think is the best way to change the conversation about sexual assault? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter @kellywallacetv.

{"_id":"Shinzo Abe to become first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor","articleText":"Tokyo (CNN)Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Monday he will visit Pearl Harbor in late December with President Barack Obama, 75 years after Japan's attack on Hawaii in 1941.He will be the first Japanese leader to visit the site since the end of World War II.Speaking to reporters on Monday evening, Abe implied the visit was in return for Obama visiting Hiroshima earlier this year.\"President Obama's message for the world without nuclear upon his visit to Hiroshima was engraved in the heart of the Japanese people,\" he said.\"I will visit Pearl Harbor with President Obama. This will be a visit to soothe the souls of the victims. We should never repeat the ravages of the war.\"The surprise attack on December 7, 1941, killed more than 2,000 Americans and triggered the entry of the US into World War II.The announcement coincides with the 75th anniversary of the battle on Wednesday. A 'significant' gesture from JapanSpeaking to CNN, Tokyo-based Asia Strategy founder Keith Henry said it was an \"enormous\" symbolic gesture on Japan's part.\"It's quite significant -- like so many things in any nation's past, a recognition of (its) occurrence is the first step in terms of creating something new to ensure it never happens again,\" he said.Henry said the US-Japan relationship was the \"lynchpin\" of peace in the Asia region and Abe's move towards reconciliation was an acknowledgment of that.\"The security of both countries is very much tied together, because Asia is a very different place to 20 years ago,\" he said.Although Abe will be the first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor he won't be the first member of his family to do so -- his wife, Akie Abe, made a surprise visit in August 2016 to pay tribute.Obama's historic visitIn May, Obama became the first sitting US President to visit Hiroshima, where the US dropped a nuclear bomb in 1945 that killed more than 100,000 Japanese men, women and children.Abe's planned visit is a way of reciprocating the commitment shown by Obama to Japan-US relations, said David Warren, an associate fellow of the Asia program at Chatham House in London.Warren said that the visit would likely be welcomed by most Japanese but was still politically controversial.\"Prime Minister Abe has politicians within his own Liberal Democratic Party who will object to his paying atonement in this way because there are some political voices in Japan who reject the principle of what we see as guilt for causing the war,\" Warren told CNN.Warren said that although the visit marked the attack's 75th anniversary, it was also timed ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.\"I'm sure that Prime Minister Abe will want to send the most powerful message he can in advance of Donald Trump becoming president in January about the importance and strength of the US-Japanese alliance.\"Obama put US-Japan relations high on his agenda when he assumed office in 2009. His administration has shown solidarity with Japan through joint military drills as the Asian nation faces nuclear threats from North Korea and a territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.On Obama's visit to Hiroshima in May, the president wrote in the museum's guest book, calling for a \"world without nuclear weapons.\"\"Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder the terrible forces unleashed in the not so distant past,\" Obama said in a speech on the day.\"We come to mourn the dead ... their souls speak to us and ask us to look inward. To take stock of who we are and what we might become.\"CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/asia/obama-abe-pearl-harbor/index.html"}
{"_id":"Shoppers guide to avoiding toxic chemicals","articleText":" (CNN)As you're poring over the holiday ads from major retailers to make your wish list, environmental activists want you to consider more than price when you shop. \"Use your purchasing power to drive positive change in the marketplace,\" said Mike Schade of Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, a group devoted to reducing toxic chemical footprints. \"Ask major retailers to get tough on manufacturers and use their influence to rid the marketplace of toxic chemicals.\"\"When out shopping, no one should have to worry that the shampoo, lotions, cleaners, clothing, shoes, or home electronics contain toxic ingredients that could harm their family's health,\" said Mike Belliveau, executive director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center, another group working to reduce toxic chemicals in the marketplace. \"Where would you rather shop, at a retailer that scores a B or the retailer with a red F for failure to ensure their safety of their products?\"To help consumers make those decisions, a new report from the coalition grades retailers for the first time on how well they are reducing toxic chemicals in the products they sell. Called \"Who's Minding the Store\" the report graded companies on a scale of zero to 130 points by looking at 13 different categories of action retailers could take, including chemical safety screening, ingredient disclosure, efforts to find safer alternatives and reporting the amount of \"chemicals of high concern\" the company has reduced or eliminated. Those chemicals include heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic, toxic flame retardants and endocrine disruptors such as parabens, BPA and formaldehyde. The good news, said Schade, is that two top retailers, Walmart and Target, received a B grade for making \"meaningful progress\" over the last three years toward safer chemicals in the products they sell. In fact, both companies expanded their list of problematic chemicals to over 2,000.\"This summer Walmart reported that their suppliers had reduced high priority chemicals by 23 million pounds,\" said Schade, \"and Target added cosmetics to their policy for the first time and improved suppliers' transparency practices, especially in regard to fragrance.\"Unfortunately, says Schade, the average grade among the 11 retailers was a D+.  \"There are some serious laggers,\" he said, \"showing there is a need for significant improvement in the marketplace to protect consumers.\"F for Amazon, Costco, AlbertsonsThe online retailer Amazon received the worst score, only 7.5 points out of 130. Costco didn't fare much better, scoring only 9.5 points. Schade said all of the companies were shown the report in advance, and given the chance to respond. \"Neither Costco or Amazon formally responded to our communications,\" said Schade. \"We think this is deeply concerning. Amazon, for example, is set to become the largest retailer of apparel and electronics over the next year, and increasingly rolling out new product lines. They need to catch up.\"Albertsons, a supermarket chain, also received an F in the report, scoring only 12.5 points out of 130. The company told CNN that the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families report \"offers an incomplete view of the work we do to offer our customers products and merchandise that put safety first.\"\"In fact, in May 2016, we were recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency for our efforts toward labeling our private label products which meet the EPA's Safer Choice requirements,\" said Chris Wilcox, vice president of communications. \"We are committed to continuing these efforts across the products we manufacture and those we sell in our stores, and to giving our customers the information they need to make purchasing choices that are right for them.'Amazon did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Costco said it was not able to provide a response.More scoresKroger received a D- in the ratings, with only 15.5 points. More Ds were assigned to Walgreens with 29.5 points, Lowe's at 29.5 and Home Depot at 35.5 points of out 130. Home Depot and Kroger did not respond to a request for comment. Corporate public relations at Lowe's said: \"Safer Chemicals shared a copy of their study with us. We continue to have conversations with this group and others to learn more about their concerns.\" Walgreens told CNN it is working with their English partner Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has \"already developed an advanced program in retailing, manufacturing and chemical sustainability. We also are in continuous dialogue with multiple external parties including laboratories, NGO's and other retailers to improve the transparency of product ingredients and chemicals of concern.\"\"It's not all doom and gloom,\" said Schade. \"Some companies are making significant progress. For example, CVS Health has signed the Chemical Footprint Project, the first pharmacy to do so, and has pledged to tell the public by 2017 about its list of restricted chemicals. And Best Buy told us they are working on a safer chemicals policy and restricted substance list.\"CVS Health (53 points) and Best Buy (41 points) both fell into the C category.Why retailers?Why should so much of the responsibility for change rest on the shoulders of giant retailers? Because they are on the front line of consumer discontent and they have a fundamental moral responsibility, argues Schade.\"If you think about it, most people don't buy products directly from the manufacturer,\" he said. \"It is retailers that have the relationships. The eleven retailers we evaluated have combined sales of over one trillion dollars, a market power that can transform the toxic chemical economy.\"Schade also pointed to the economic fallout that can affect companies when consumers find out that a company has been selling toxic products. Take for example the case of Lumber Liquidators, whose stock collapsed after CNN's Anderson Cooper reported, on the CBS News show \"60 Minutes,\" that the flooring sold by the company contained high levels of the cancer-causing chemical formaldehyde. The company's CEO later resigned. \"And there's a United Nations report that documents the various financial and business risks associated with toxic chemicals -- including over $138 million in fines against Walmart, CVS and other retailers,\" said Schade.So what can a consumer do if they believe their favorite retailer doesn't have a satisfactory grade?\"We have an online action page,\" said Schade. \"There you can both thank those companies who are doing well, and encourage those who are not to become a leader and not a lagger.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/shopping-toxic-chemical-report-card/index.html"}
{"_id":"Should Democrats cooperate with Trump?","articleText":"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \"Jimmy Carter\" and \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\" He is the co-host of the podcast, Politics & Polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)A fight has broken out among congressional Democrats about how to respond to President-elect Donald Trump. Now that the dust from the election has started to settle, there are two contradictory arguments about what the strategy should be in the coming months.Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose populist campaign rocked the Democratic Party, indicated he would work with Trump if the President-elect was serious about pursuing policies that take on corporate power and benefit working Americans. Sanders is not alone. According to The New York Times, Sen. Charles Schumer has spoken with Trump several times and next week plans to announce a series of initiatives, like infrastructure and mandatory paid maternity leave, they can work on together. In essence, at least on paper, these Democrats are willing to \"normalize\" the Trump presidency and pursue the possibility of bipartisan compromise should that be offered. Even President Obama, acting in the role of a statesman, has made a series of statements since the election urging Democrats to give Trump a chance. \"I don't think he is ideological, I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way and can serve him well as long as he's got good people around him and he has a good sense of direction.\"Other Democrats are not biting. Still feeling the heat from the election, they insist that Donald Trump is more dangerous than your \"normal\" Republican politician. His views on many issues, including immigration and gender, are so far outside the regular political spectrum that it doesn't make sense for their party to try to compromise. His appointment of Steve Bannon as a senior adviser is an outrageous and unacceptable move that brings the voices of the alt-right into the highest levels of power. Rather than offering an olive branch, Democrats like the retiring Sen. Harry Reid are calling on their colleagues to stand firm against this president. \"We have a responsibility to be the voice of the millions of Americans,\" he tweeted, \"who are afraid that they are unwelcome in Donald Trump's America.\" This is not time, they say, to play nice. The danger of compromiseWhat to do? The danger with too much talk about compromise is that Democrats will fall into the same trap that President Obama faced in his first two years in the White House, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate yet the administration wanted to see if bipartisanship was possible. During those crucial years, the President continued to reach out his hand to Republicans in Congress only to have them bite it in return. He continually bargained against himself, only to find that most Republicans had no interest in reaching deals.Right now there is no reason for Democrats to believe that Donald Trump will refrain from pursuing a fairly radical political agenda. With united government and a rightward GOP, he will be under intense pressure to move forward with the most radical elements of his agenda:  a draconian immigration crackdown, rolling back regulations on climate change, regressive tax cuts, deregulating the financial sector, harsh national security measures targeting Muslims and more.  As Politico reported, bankers are pretty optimistic from what they are seeing in the transition that this White House will be extremely friendly to them. House Speaker Paul Ryan is planning to move forward with plans to privatize Medicare.  Trump's announcement of his first three major appointments -- Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn to be national security adviser, and Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA -- were all indications that the Trump from the campaign trail is the Trump who will be president. Sessions, who a Republican Senate refused to confirm for a federal judgeship in 1986 because of his personal comments on race, is an opponent of civil rights laws and an advocate for cracking down on the rights of immigrants, legal and illegal. He was one of the first to defend Trump's remarks on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. Flynn has a long paper trail of making blistering and radical statements about Muslims, even supporting candidate Trump's call for a temporary ban on their entry into the United States. At the Republican convention, he joined the crowd in calling for Hillary Clinton to be \"locked up.\" Pompeo was a driving force behind the Benghazi investigation.Even if there is a chance Trump is serious about an infrastructure package that would help provide jobs, Democrats would have to be willing to give the Republicans a major policy victory -- that would help to cement some of the coalition that Trump built with disaffected white voters -- with the knowledge they would help him in advancing the rest of his policies. There are also many questions being raised by Democrats about the kind of package Trump is thinking about. As Ronald Klain wrote in The Washington Post, the plan consists primarily of unfunded tax cuts for investors and contractors, and its not at all clear how many jobs this will actually create. Working with Trump, as if he was just any Republican president, would also help  give him legitimacy in the public mind. Given the kind of campaign he has run, which included the themes of xenophobia, sexism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, this is a high risk maneuver. If Democrats are serious that they see no place for these ideas at the political table, that some things must remain out of bounds in American politics, then starting to cut deals with Trump -- with someone like Bannon by his side -- will send a dangerous message that will be impossible to erase.As Jamelle Bouie argued in Slate, \"The simple truth is that Trump's use of explicit racism -- his deliberate attempt to incite Americans against different groups of nonwhites -- was integral to his campaign. It was part and parcel of his 'populism' and told a larger story: that either at home or abroad, foreigners and their 'globalist' allies were cheating the American worker, defined as a white working-class man with a factory job.\" Supporting Trump's infrastructure plan, Bouie writes, \"legitimizes and gives fuel to white tribalism as a political strategy.\" The obstructionist and confrontational approach might be less palatable; it certainly does not sound as good in public and will put Democrats in the uncomfortable position of doing exactly what they didn't think Republicans should do.  But sometimes there are pivotal moments when a party needs to take a strong and principled stand. In this case, there are practical reasons to do so, avoiding a deal with the president of a coalition prepared to strip away the most basic elements of their agenda. But more importantly, the party needs to make a decision about entering into any kind of an alliance with a politician whose ideas and arguments were so antithetical to every ideal that the party has been fighting for over the past few decades. While some Democrats might worry about how this would \"look\" to the public, they should remember that it didn't look good for Republicans to be obstructionists and they now have control of the White House, Congress, and 34 state legislative bodies.Nor do Democrats need to engage in the kind of scorched earth obstructionism that we have seen with the GOP. They can keep funding the government, raising the debt ceiling and confirming justices and reasonable Cabinet appointments, though they should be willing to ask tough questions and oppose picks that don't seem acceptable. But what they don't have to do is start working with the Republicans on their legislative agenda; they can also keep the White House on the defensive through oversight and investigation if there is any evidence of wrongdoing or abuse of power.  Democrats are at the crossroads. Before jumping into the traditional celebration of bipartisanship, Democrats need to be thinking carefully about whether these are really normal times and what the costs can be of making a decision to work with President-elect Trump.

{"_id":"Should dating apps have HIV filters?","articleText":" (CNN)After uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you're now thinking, \"What type of person am I actually looking for?\"Dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion -- but they could be even more personal.This summer, the gay social networking app Grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey \"What is your current HIV status?\" and \"How would you feel if Grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by HIV status?\"In a statement, a Grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.\"We have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their HIV status and test dates. Given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,\" the statement said. \"Sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.\"Screenshots of the survey were posted online by Daniel Reeders, a Ph.D. candidate who studies HIV stigma at Australian National University. He got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a \"digital quarantine.\" \"Dating sites and apps shouldn't ask for HIV status, because there's no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,\" Reeders said. \"The harassment that 'poz' (HIV-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it's from a small segment of the community.  People already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.\"Indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that HIV or other STD filters on a dating app might do more harm than good. More harm than good?Although an HIV filter could have the benefit of letting HIV-positive people meet others -- avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations -- it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said Dr. Eric Schrimshaw, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.Some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of HIV status prior to any kind of sexual activity. But for some, a dating app filter could lead HIV-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only HIV-negative people, he said. From there, they might engage in unprotected sex. This could lead to HIV infections because \"one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don't know yet.\"Another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by further isolating them socially and \"demonizing the population.\" \"With more HIV stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,\" said Dr. Gary Harper, a public health professor at the University of MichiganSince most STDs are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, Harper said; they wouldn't even think to include them in their dating profiles. But a filter for any incurable STD, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.Harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: You may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your HIV status on an online network of strangers.  Dating apps and the rise of STDsOnline dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among Americans. According to the Pew Research Center, about 15% of adults in the United States are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.Some link the ease of seeking casual sexual partners to the spread of STDs. Last year, the Rhode Island health department attributed an increase in STD cases to \"using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters.\" A 2013 study found that the usage of Craigslist led to a 16% increase in HIV cases across 33 states. Lead author Dr. Jason Chan, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, said that although he would expect HIV cases to rise given the trend in dating app use, as people are becoming more cautious about sex, HIV might not necessarily spread.Harper said the relationship between dating apps and the spread of HIV is more complicated than one might think. The association could have more to do with a user's existing tendency to engage in risky sexual behaviors and the prevalence of HIV and other STDs in one's dating pool and area. Because of the complexity of the issue, an HIV filtering feature on dating apps would not necessarily be an effective prevention measure, said Dr. Renata Sanders, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\"There is no evidence suggesting that by dividing people by their HIV status on a mobile app where people meet would work to prevent HIV,\" Sanders said. \"What actually helps prevent HIV is knowing your status and using effective measures to curb HIV spread such as condoms and PrEP,\" a pill that can prevent the virus.What are the alternatives?Instead of a filter, experts said, it would be better to leave the choice to users. Letting users self-report HIV and STD status on their profiles could open up conversations and  prevent misunderstandings that might lead to infection, and it \"helps create a norm or a culture on the app where that's a topic that gets discussed prior to meeting,\" said Schrimshaw of Columbia University.Some apps, in fact, are already doing that. For example, Hornet, a dating app for gay men, has a \"Know Your Status\" feature that allows users to disclose one of five HIV statuses: \"negative,\" \"negative on PrEP,\" \"positive,\" \"positive undetectable\" and \"unknown.\" The app also allows HIV-positive users to search for other positive people, but HIV-negative users don't have the ability to look for only negative users. Dr. Ian Holloway, a public affairs professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Hornet's positive-only search feature can be helpful for HIV-positive men to seek not only partners, but social support and advice. Without giving the search to HIV-negative men, the feature could prevent users from having a false sense of security and encourage them to have conversations about HIV with their partners. Alex Garner, Hornet's senior health innovation strategist, said it is an effort to encourage thoughtful conversation about HIV and gay men's sexual health and to \"bridge the divide between HIV-positive and -negative people.\"Dating apps and sites can play a powerful role in raising awareness about HIV And STD prevention without fueling stigmas or discrimination, researchers said.For example, Holloway's 2013 study found that more than 80% of Grindr users in Southern California are willing to participate in HIV prevention programs delivered online or through mobile apps. The study suggests that apps with geolocating features may consider providing quick reference to nearby HIV testing locations as a way to encourage more men to get tested, raise awareness and help facilitate access to community services. Another recent study found that Grindr was an effective way to give out HIV self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of HIV.Sanders, the Johns Hopkins professor, thinks it is good practice for apps and sites to send out alerts and information about HIV and STD prevention and treatment, such as how often one should get tested for which kinds of STD and what should get checked when going to see a doctor.

{"_id":"Should there really be a cutoff age for mammograms?","articleText":" (CNN)Doctors in the US have long recommended that women start getting mammograms, which screen for breast cancer, in their 40s, but there has been ongoing debate on the age when women should stop getting the biennial screenings.Some experts argue that there is not enough evidence to endorse mammograms for women 75 and older, which could be detrimental for certain women if their mammograms result in false-positive results.Meanwhile, other experts contend that older women can benefit from mammograms, especially since breast cancer risk increases with age.The age of cutoff is similar worldwide. In Australia, women are invited for routine screening between the ages of 50 and 74, while in the UK, they are invited between 50 and 70 years.But now, a new study suggests that there is no reason for older women to skip mammograms and that such screening decisions should be based on a woman's personal health. \"This is the largest study on this topic,\" said Dr. Cindy Lee, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and lead author of the study. She is scheduled to present the study at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America on Monday.\"It's surprising that there's so much uncertainty and so much controversy about when we should continue and when we should stop the breast cancer screening, and this study tries to answer that question,\" she said. \"Our study supports that there shouldn't be a specific age cutoff. In other words, there's no magical age number that you should stop people from getting screened for breast cancer, because it's a really individual decision.\"Most health insurance programs in the US cover screening mammograms, which are X-ray photos of the breast, and getting mammograms every two years can lower a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A cancer detection trend discoveredThe new study used data from about 6 million screening mammograms performed across the country between 2008 and 2014. That data, which included about three million women aged 40 to 90 years old, came from the American College of Radiology's National Mammography Database.Lee and her colleagues analyzed the data, taking a close look at patients' ages, their screening results, how many were called back for additional evaluation and their biopsy results. They then found that as the age of patients increased until 90 years old, so did the rate in which cancer was detected in their screenings.In other words, \"as women get older, you're finding more cancers per 1,000 screening mammograms,\" Lee said. \"It makes sense to us that the cancer detection rate is significantly higher with increased age, because breast cancer is a disease of older women.\"Previous research has shown that many cancers detected by mammograms represent over-diagnosis.  Yet the new study shows that mammograms still can be effective and might even improve in performance as women age, said Dr. Andrew Kaunitz, professor and associate chairman of the University of Florida's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who was not involved in the study.'The decision when to stop has to be individualized'While the new study demonstrates that screening can be effective at finding disease among older women, it does not show that this early detection prevents breast cancer deaths, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a practicing oncologist, who was also not involved in the study. \"I do believe that early detection in this age group can prevent deaths, but this paper does not address that,\" Brawley said. More research is needed to provide evidence that supports that conclusion.The new study, however, still offers information that has not been provided before in previous research, Brawley said.\"Some organizations, such as the ACS, have recommended that screening continue until the woman has a life expectancy of less than 10 years,\" Brawley said. \"For the average American woman, life expectancy is 82, that translates into stopping screening at 72. ... The decision when to stop has to be individualized to a woman's health history.\"Kaunitz, who is not associated with the cancer society, added, \"In my practice, many of the women in their mid-70s and older I see are active and have life expectancies that exceed one decade. The majority of these patients wish to continue screening mammograms, a decision I support.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/breast-cancer-mammograms-age/index.html"}

She's the yoga coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Lightning and others in Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional Golfers' Association. (CNN)Calming activities such as yoga and meditation can be very effective stress relievers, especially when integrated into daily life. However, sometimes stress, like steam trapped under the lid of a boiling pot, needs a more powerful release.There's a common saying in sports for that type of release: \"Leave it all on the field.\" Athletes put it into practice by channeling their emotions into the fuel that powers their performance, leaving any and all anxiety, anger, frustration, etc., on the playing field. That's exactly the approach I take toward my high-intensity workouts when I'm looking to blow off steam. It's empowering and cathartic to direct and release my stress through an explosive outlet, such as kicking a heavy bag or slamming a medicine ball to the ground. Although many forms of exercise counter stress by boosting endorphins (our brain's feel-good neurotransmitters), recent research points to higher-intensity exercise offering increased mood-enhancing benefits. According to a study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in August, moderate and high-intensity exercise demonstrated a greater beneficial impact than low-intensity forms. What's more, research shows that regular blood-pumping aerobic workouts can reduce your sensitivity to stress over time.Below, I've shared six of my favorite sweat-inducing, stress-releasing exercises. You can do them on their own or combine any or all as part of a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) workout, doing intervals of each exercise with a short rest in between. Don't forget to warm up appropriately prior to performing intense exercise. I always foam roll and do a brief breathing and yoga series for muscle activation and enhancing range of motion. The routine I featured in this article on morning yoga can serve as an effective warm-up. If you're new to high-intensity training, check with your doctor before beginning, and consider hiring a certified trainer for help learning how to safely perform the exercises. You'll only add to your stress if you hurt yourself!Remember that high-intensity exercise requires adequate hydration. Emerging research shows that dehydration can have a negative impact on mood and cognition. So don't counteract the positive effects of your workout; drink plenty of water before, during and after your training sessions. Because sweat-intensive workouts cause us to lose electrolytes that are essential for our bodies' neural and muscular processes and maintaining equilibrium, it's best to rehydrate with an electrolyte-enriched water or sports drink.KickboxingThere's nothing quite like taking out your stress on a heavy bag! It provides uniquely satisfying tactile and auditory stimulation that reinforces your sense of release with every kick and punch landed. Of course, not everyone has a heavy bag hanging in their garage gym, like I do. But most gyms and martial arts facilities offer kickboxing classes. If you've never kickboxed before, classes provide the opportunity to learn the techniques for executing different punches and kicks, like the roundhouse kick. When I kickbox, I generally go for three to five rounds of a two-to-one work-to-rest ratio: one minute on the bag practicing a series of punches and kicks, and then an active 30-second rest period of side-stepping or jogging around the bag.Tabata pushup drillsSometimes, we need to push our limits to feel like we've exhausted all of our nervous energy. Tabata drills, created by Japanese scientist Izumi Tabata as a form of HIIT training, provide the perfect platform. The drills consist of the same exercise through eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest for a total of four minutes. Personally, I like to use pushups, but you can do any exercise in this format (e.g., jumping jacks, jumping rope, body-weight squats). If you try pushups, simply do as many as you can with good form for 20 seconds and then rest for 10. Repeat through eight rounds. Due to of the intensity of the drills, by the last couple of rounds, I often end up modifying my pushups by putting my knees down or widening my stance. Don't be afraid to modify the entire time to maintain form and avoid injury. Medicine ball slamsHave you ever slammed a door out of frustration? It feels good ... but not very productive. Slamming medicine balls is a much better alternative that also serves as a core-focused total-body exercise. Medicine balls are weighted balls used in a variety of exercises. Slams can be done from standing, kneeling or half-kneeling stances. You can slam the ball straight down, diagonally or rotating to the side. I do three to five rounds of 10 (five on each side) at a two-to-one work-to-rest ratio. Select a ball weight based on what you can safely raise overhead and slam hard enough to bounce and catch on each repetition. SprintingWhen I'm so stressed that I need to pound the pavement, I prefer sprinting over long-distance running. If you decide to sprint off your stress, make sure you add a light run to your warm-up. There's a speed-limit sign on one end of the street 100 yards from our house, so I jog up and back. Then, for my sprints, I perform five sets of 50-yard dashes halfway to the sign, resting in between for three or four times the amount of time I sprinted. Because of the energy system used for sprinting, it's necessary to rest much longer to replenish your body's resources for providing that kind of dramatic energy expenditure. Kettlebell swingsDespite being an explosive strength exercise, the flowing, rhythmic nature of kettlebell swings feels like meditation in motion to me. That said, it took me a long time and a lot of practice to perfect my swing form. The flowing movement may look simple to execute, but don't be fooled! A complex series of stabilizing and mobilizing forces is required to safely and effectively swing a kettlebell. There are good videos for beginners to learn proper swing form. The standard starting kettlebell weight is 16 kilograms (about 35 pounds) for men and 8 kilograms (about 18 pounds) for women. I started with 8 kilograms and progressed to 16 kilograms. I practice five sets of 10 to 20 swings, resting for 30 seconds to a minute in between sets. Box jumpsWhen the weight of stress is pulling me down, jumping (symbolically and literally) empowers me to defy that pull. I love box jumps, a form of explosive jump training known as plyometrics. Box jumps are exactly what they sound like: jumping up on a box. When you first start, be conservative with your box height. Twelve to 18 inches is a good starting height range. Don't try to go too high too soon, or your shins will pay for it as you inevitably miss your mark. The goal is not to achieve a high height for low reps but to jump repeatedly for higher reps with grace and control, landing softly each time. I usually practice three rounds of 10, resting for one to two minutes in between.Now that you know some ways to sweat out your stress, don't be afraid to metaphorically \"leave it all on the field.\" Go ahead and sprint out your frustrations. Punch and kick your fears away. And slam your stress to smithereens!","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/health/sweat-out-stress/index.html"}
{"_id":"Slaughter of innocents continues in battle for Mosul","articleText":"Mosul, Iraq (CNN)Omar Ali stands outside his home in eastern Mosul weeping. The young father's sense of relief after being liberated from ISIS has been replaced by a feeling of unbearable loss.Only a day earlier his 18-month-old daughter Amira was there on the pavement in the Zahraa neighborhood playing with relatives when a mortar round landed nearby. Shrapnel tore through the air and the child's skull. Amira was killed instantly. Her two cousins were seriously injured. \"Look world, this is my daughter,\" Omar Ali cries. \"What did she do wrong? She's gone. She was just playing. She's gone from me and she's my only child.\" He holds a photograph of Amira dressed in a black sweater with white hearts, her cherub face looking up rather than at the camera. She is young and innocent like so many of the dozens of civilian victims the street-to-street battle for Mosul produces every single day.The fight to save livesTwo kilometers away in a dusty lot behind an abandoned house turned clinic, a team of Iraqi military medics fights to save the lives of injured people who can get there. Every day they see the terrible consequences of mortars fired into neighborhoods like Zahraa, where Amira lost her short life. It's a bloody, seemingly endless production line. The wounded are delivered, patched up quickly and loaded into ambulances for transport to hospitals. \"ISIS now has no course of action but to target children and civilians, because they are the easiest to attack,\" says Lt. Khaleel Amer, head of the triage center. \"The mortar rounds have left so many civilians wounded or dead.\" The terror group's tactic of desperation as nearly 100,000 fighters advance toward Mosul is to simply lob mortars indiscriminately toward government-controlled areas.  One family arrives in the back of a Humvee belonging to the Iraqi Counter-Terror Force.  Eight wounded men stumble out on their own or are gently lifted by the soldiers. One man with leg injuries plants a kiss of gratitude on the cheek of the uniformed medic carrying him in his arms. Suddenly an unharmed man yells: \"Everything is gone because of ISIS! God damn ISIS and those who brought them upon us!\" He breaks down in tears, too distraught to give his name, and continues to tell the story of how his 21-year-old son was killed. \"A mortar fell just in front of the door. We came and he was just a piece of meat. Four or five of my neighbors were standing with him. And they are all dead.\" What's left of his son is wrapped in a dark green blanket in the back of the Humvee. Just across the street, parents struggle to carry their belongings and children wave white flags as they stream into a processing center for refugees They are among the 68,000 people the United Nations estimates have been displaced by the fighting, just a fraction of Mosul's population. \"It was a terrifying night,\" one mother says as she gathers her children. \"As soon as there was daylight we packed our belongings and left. Thank God we are safe.\"Choosing to stayThe Iraqi government and military have advised Mosul's population of about 1.5 million to remain in their homes, fearing the possibility of a large-scale exodus that aid groups say they are not equipped to handle.There is little food, limited electricity, and no running water, but some residents say they indeed prefer the comforts of home to the indignity of a refugee camp.\"Why would I leave my home?\" asks one resident, who won't reveal his name out of security concerns. \"I have young children. It would be very difficult for them to be in a cold refugee camp over home.\" The father of three was a teacher and when ISIS took control of his city he was forced to disseminate the extremist group's curriculum, one so radical that he refused to send his own children to school.\"I only had four students in my class,\" he says. \"Only the children of ISIS members went to the school. All the other students lost two years of their education.\"His neighbors seem to agree. There are many challenges to come but life under ISIS was unbearable. Government salaries and pensions were no longer available, isolation meant economic difficulty, and the tyranny of the organization's rule created fear.\"ISIS is like a dark thing on your chest,\" says Talal Mustafa, who lives just a few houses down. \"Yes, the darkness is gone.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/middleeast/mosul-innocents-slaughtered/index.html"}

{"_id":"South Korea and Japan sign military intelligence-sharing deal","articleText":"Seoul (CNN)Japan and South Korea, once bitter enemies, have agreed to their closest military cooperation since the end of World War II.The deal, which has been in the pipeline for five years, will allow both countries to share military intelligence directly without using the US military as an intermediary.  Washington, a close ally of both countries, has long encouraged better relations between the two, even though many in South Korea are critical of the pact.Intelligence sharingSouth Korea's Ministry of National Defense in a statement Wednesday highlighted the merits of the deal, saying \"Japan's investment in national defense is higher than South Korea's which enables the country to monitor and detect military information.\"  Seoul is hoping the data will help it to analyze North Korea's ballistic missile launches and their trajectories as well as the country's nuclear and submarine capabilities.North Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests since Pyongyang claimed to have successfully detonated a thermonuclear device in January. The deal comes amid uncertainty over the future of the THAAD missile defense system, which Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy in South Korea by the end of this year. US President-elect Donald Trump, however, has called for US allies to bear more of the costs of their own defense. In a lengthy article Wednesday, the North Korean state-controlled news agency KCNA accused Washington of going \"so far as to breach the basic principles of international laws and ditch its dignity of a superpower by pleading with other countries to join their pressure racket against (North Korea) through downgrading or severing ties with it.\" Japan is the 33rd country with which South Korea has signed a military deal. Under the agreement, which takes place immediately, all confidential and secret information can be shared between the countries' intelligence agencies.

{"_id":"South Korea scandal: Can Viagra help with altitude sickness?","articleText":" (CNN)When South Korean President Park Geun-Hye's spokesman said 364 Viagra pills bought by her office were for \"altitude sickness,\" some online users reacted with disbelief.\"Now I get why older Koreans are so psyched to go mountain hiking every weekend,\" Yonsei University Professor John Delury tweeted on Wednesday.But what if the South Korean President's office was onto something?High-altitude mountaineers and a biochemistry expert told CNN Viagra was sometimes used by climbers to avoid altitude sickness, although its usefulness has yet to be clinically proven.'I've carried it myself'Veteran Australian mountaineer Andrew Lock, who has climbed all 14 of the world's 8,000 meter peaks, told CNN he first heard of climbers discuss using Viagra for pulmonary edemas about 10 years ago.A pulmonary edema occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid in the lungs at altitude, making it hard to breath and potentially leading to death.\"The benefit in terms of climbing is if someone is suffering altitude sickness ... that particular drug will help you dilate those blood vessels and carry that fluid away from the lungs, because if you don't get that fluid out you can actually drown in (them),\" he said.Lock said while the primary cure for a severe pulmonary edema was to descend, Viagra could help slow its development until you climb lower. \"I've carried it myself for that purpose,\" he said.New Zealander Guy Cotter, chief executive of mountain climbing guide company Adventure Consultants, said he knew the drug had been tested at high altitudes but didn't believe the results had proven to be negative or positive.\"We joke that the best use of Viagra on an expedition is to stop the blokes rolling out of bed at night,\" he said.Medical opinion divided According to the Institute for Altitude Medicine's website, altitude illness can refer to three different problems: acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema and high altitude pulmonary edema.For a pulmonary edema, the institute said while Viagra is sometimes used for treatment, it hasn't been proven conclusively to help.Speaking to CNN, biochemistry lecturer at Australia's Murdoch University, Dr Garth Maker, said from \"a molecular mechanism perspective,\" Viagra could be potentially used to treat altitude sickness.\"It dilates the blood vessels therefore you get a drop in blood pressure. So there is certainly a basis for it (but) from what I can see the general consensus is that it's very much a 'maybe' at the moment,\" he said.Maker said there were other more commonly used drugs for altitude sickness.Pills purchased for Africa tripThe Viagra pills story came to light on Wednesday after a local Korean newspaper, Munhwa Ilbo, released a list of medicine purchased by the president's office between January 2014 and September 2016.It was requested by opposition party member Kim Sang-hee. Among the items were 364 Viagra pills, 150 placenta parental injections and medicine for chronic fatigue.\"Viagra pills were purchased in preparation for altitude sickness ahead of (President) Park's visit to African nations,\" South Korean Presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk said during a daily briefing.\"None of them were used.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/health/viagra-south-korea-altitude-sickness/index.html"}
{"_id":"Southern kitchen stays true to its roots","articleText":"Cumberland Island  (CNN)When Whitney Otawka walked into a restaurant in Berkeley to apply for a job waiting tables, she couldn't imagine that in a few years she would be a contestant on \"Top Chef\" and running the culinary program on a historic island. But that's exactly what happened. Otawka moved around, working in the front and back of the house (restaurant-speak for waiting tables or line cooking) at various places, but it wasn't until she moved to the South that she realized cooking was her true passion. She was enchanted by the culinary traditions of the South and its agricultural history that was visible to her on a daily basis in this region. \"When I lived in California, 10 years ago you would not have seen grits on a menu, but now you can see them on menus from San Diego to San Francisco. I never had okra, zipper peas, benne, Carolina gold rice, persimmon, poke sallet, or ramps until moving to the South.\" That's where Cumberland Island comes in. The island is famous for its historical roots. Steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie and his brother Thomas made this stretch of land off the coast of Georgia their family playground. Their legacy has lived on in the Greyfield Inn, a mansion that was converted into a hotel. People from all over the world travel to this remote getaway and take in the beauty of 17 miles of untamed beaches, wild horses and nature. It's also where visitors can partake in Otawka's unique culinary creations.  No restaurants here. But the dining is fine.There are only two ways to stay on this Island as a visitor. Pack your food, pitch a tent and camp overnight or lodge at the inn, where Otawka leads the dining program.After leaving her post in city kitchens, she found her way here on Cumberland, becoming the executive chef at Greyfield Inn. Partnering with her husband Ben Wheatley on the inn's food program, the two don't have to look far for inspiration; they're embedded in lush natural resources.10 historic national park lodgesAt any moment Otawka can step out the kitchen back door and walk to Greyfield's organic garden close by. She works in tandem with the team that tends to it, experimenting with produce and spice blends. Growing turmeric and peppers for her to dehydrate and make into turmeric powder and paprika. Or uprooting fresh spring onions and dandelion greens for her to toss into a bowl of lettuce to add texture and flavor. Whether it's baby squash or heirloom tomatoes, the garden overflows with fresh ingredients.The team's mission, Otawka says, \"is to supply the Greyfield Inn with a variety of fresh produce, herbs, fruit, and cut flowers. We use sustainable and organic growing practices and utilize composting, cover cropping, and crop rotation to replenish and build our soils.\"Otawka's vision of using the land around her in her cooking extends beyond the garden. She recently started a sea-salt program. Collecting ocean water in big basins, she filters it so the sediment settles to the bottom, and then sanitizes it with a quick boil. That's followed by dragging tubs of the remaining water out into the sun, where it evaporates leaving her with crunchy salt crystals.But wait, there's more. Nearby bees swarm around honeycombs collected from the island's apiary program. Men and women in netted coverings transfer these combs with a delicacy as if they are handling bricks of precious gold. Otawka deliciously incorporates the homegrown honey into her menu --  stirring it into cold ice cream or crumbly cakes.Not all the food, however, comes from the island. While most of the seafood, including juicy shrimp, buttery clams and oysters, is from the surrounding rivers, Otawka also receives deliveries by boat. Purveyors such as Captain Snorkie drop off bags of local seafood from the Georgia and Florida coasts on the pier where Otawka makes her transactions before bringing her goods back to the kitchen to cook up for the evening.The Gulf oyster revival\"Specific to the coastal waters, Georgia white shrimp, sheepshead, Cumberland oysters are three very prolific ingredients we get right off the island. The crazy thing about the island is that there is so much bounty from this 17-mile stretch of land: bananas, olive trees, calamondin, fig trees, wild persimmons, blackberries, blueberries, grapefruit, acorns, and passion fruit. It's astonishing the diversity of what grows on this island.\" From the wild to the plateOn any given evening when the dinner bell rings, Greyfield guests head to the front porch to sip cocktails, like bourbon on ice, while sitting in old rocking chairs.Otawka slips out of the kitchen with a large wooden board hosting slivers of creamy Brie and glass containers of honey. She scatters toasted almonds among the containers and places them next to warm bread and spicy hummus for the guests to enjoy as an appetizer. In the kitchen, Otawka has set up with Wheatley an assembly line system that is effective and succinct. Everyone is laser-focused on the tasks at hand. Waiters scurry in and out, picking up dinner plates or providing cold bottles of champagne. Dressed in crisp white blouses and shirts, the wait staff at Greyfield operates with an old-timey elegance, serving with a steady charm and ease.Otawka credits her husband with helping to create the best dining experiences possible. \"I would not be the chef I am without Ben. We are a team in the truest sense of the word. We offer two very different skill sets in the kitchen, but we have a shared goal and vision for the food we are producing. I am full of big ideas, organized, driven and loud and he is detail oriented, meticulous, precise, and we both have a constant desire to learn and push our technique and flavors. We love nothing more than sitting together at a table and sharing a meal together. We celebrate 10 years of working together this December.\" After a multi-course supper, guests at the Greyfield retire to their rooms, relax in the library or return to the porch to savor the setting sun. There is no Wi-Fi here. So unplugged patrons simply sit back and listen to the cicadas chirping and the fans humming while basking in all that is Cumberland Island.

{"_id":"Southern wildfires burn 80,000 acres across six states","articleText":" (CNN)Crippling drought conditions are sparking blaze after blaze across six states in the South.More than 30 large wildfires have left a trail of destruction through 80,000 acres in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky, according to the US Forest Service.\"Dry weather, high winds and the continuing drought is driving the large growth of fires,\" said Dave Martin, Deputy Director of Operations for Fire and Aviation Management for the US Forest Service's Southern Region. He said since the fires are spread out over several states, the agencies resources are being depleted.More than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation are trying to suppress these fires, he said.\"All of the Southeast is very dry ... fire doesn't know any boundaries,\" said Brian Haines, spokesman for the North Carolina Forest Service. \"Drought conditions are contributing to drier and larger forest fuels being available. These range from the undergrowth to sticks, leaves and logs. Even the smallest of sparks can ignite these very dry fuels.\" A number of the fires are being investigated as suspected arson, but natural causes and conditions are also responsible for the fires, Haines said.\"We're hoping for the best and preparing for the worst,\"  North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said at a news conference Monday. So far his state has spent $10 million to contain the wildfires, he said.\"The major goal of firefighters is to try to contain this and have it burn inward as opposed to expanding, but the fact of the matter is the fires are expanding under these incredibly difficult conditions,\" McCrory said. The governor declared a state of emergency in 25 western counties on Thursday after the fires resulted in evacuations in several counties.Officials in Tennessee and Kentucky have also declared a state of emergency.The fires also are impairing air quality. Satellite images show a blanket of smoke over the skies in several Southern states.Situation in North CarolinaEight large fires are still blazing in the mountains of western North Carolina while 15 smaller ones burn elsewhere in the state, said Haines of the North Carolina Forest Service.The Chestnut Knob Fire in South Mountain State Park has consumed about 3,200 acres and forced the closing of the park, Haines said. The Party Rock fire in Chimney Rock State Park has devoured 3,457 acres and closed that park, too. Other parks are closed so that the people who work there can help fight the fires, he said.Situation in GeorgiaPockets of wildfires also continue to burn in some parts of Northern Georgia.The Rough Ridge Fire has engulfed more than 19,411 acres and was 20% contained as of Monday morning, according to the US Forest Service. Nearly 300 firefighters are working to extinguish it. The Rough Ridge Fire was sparked by lightning 28 days ago, said Mary Stuever, a spokeswoman for the US Forest Service.The Rock Mountain Fire has grown to more than 4,100 acres and is 10% contained, according to the US Forest Service.

{"_id":"Spacecraft makes its mark on Red Planet","articleText":" (CNN)There are many craters on Mars -- but this one is different.New images show a fresh, dark mark on the face of the Red Planet. This one was made by the Schiaparelli spacecraft when it hit the surface hard after a systems malfunction.The pictures -- taken by a NASA Mars orbiter this week -- reveal the final resting place of the Mars lander, reported lost by the European Space Agency earlier this month. They also hint at the violence of the impact made by the speeding Schiaparelli at the end of its fiery plunge through the martian atmosphere.Schiaparelli was designed to be a test flight for another mission -- a planned 2020 launch that will send a rover to Mars. The agency suspects something went wrong when a parachute was jettisoned.\"The ejection itself appears to have occurred earlier than expected, but analysis is not yet complete,\" it said in a statement.Thrusters may have cut off too earlyAt a news conference announcing the loss of the craft, ESA's Director General, Jan Wörner, said Schiaparelli's primary role was to test whether they could successfully land a probe on Mars. \"Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future,\" Wörner said.The probe was equipped with nine thrusters that were due to be activated for the last 30 seconds to help cushion the landing. While they were confirmed to have been briefly activated, the agency believes they may have switched off sooner than expected.After monitoring its descent, scientists at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany, did not get a signal back from the 1,272 pound (577 kilogram) probe.Sister ship is safeSchiaparelli's companion craft, an orbiter with a much longer mission, successfully made it to orbit. The Trace Gas Orbiter will investigate the source of methane on Mars, which could be a sign of life or geological processes.The orbiter adds to a number of craft that are looking for signs of life on our neighboring planet.The presence of methane is a signature of life on Earth, so the orbiting spacecraft will be trying to detect it on Mars -- and determine where it is coming from.

{"_id":"Spike in hate crimes prompts special NY police unit","articleText":" (CNN)An \"explosion\" in hate crimes since Election Day has prompted the creation of a special police unit to fight the uptick in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. The announcement coincided with an address at Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, where Cuomo called for an end to the divisiveness that has gripped the country.\"The ugly political discourse of the election did not end on Election Day. In many ways it has gotten worse, [turning] into a social crisis that now challenges our identity as a state and as a nation and our people,\" he said.President-elect Donald Trump wasn't specifically mentioned in his church address, but Cuomo has in the past criticized Trump and vowed in a New York Daily News op-ed that he would \"reject the hateful attitudes that pervaded throughout the 2016 campaign.\"The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election. A toll-free hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomo's office.Calling this kind of prejudice a \"social poison [in] the fabric of our nation,\" the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs.Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind. The plan, he said, would be to set up a public-private partnership \"to provide immigrants who can't afford their own defense the legal assistance they need ... because in New York, we believe in justice for all,\" Cuomo said.He added, \"If there is a move to deport immigrants then I say start with me. I am a son of immigrants. Son of Mario Cuomo, who is the son of Andrea Cuomo, a poor Italian immigrant who came to this country without a job, without money, or resources and he was here only for the promise of America.\"Cuomo's plans also include the expansion of New York's Human Rights Law to protect students who are bullied or discriminated against.New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill told a New York radio station on Sunday he was disturbed by the trends. \"We've had an uptick in hate crimes, actually a little bit more than an uptick. We're up 31% from last year. We had at this time last year 250, this year we have 328, specifically against the Muslim population in New York City -- we went up from 12 to 25, and anti-Semitic is up, too, by 9% from 102 to 111,\" O'Neill said. \"I have no scientific evidence as to why, but you've been paying attention to what's been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it,\" O'Neill added. Cuomo said on Sunday that New York's tolerance will lead the way for the rest of the nation, and his announcement came as an \"anti-hate\" rally was held in a Brooklyn park vandalized with swastikas and pro-Trump graffiti.The rally, at a playground named after the late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, was attended by band member Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock.\"Keep your eyes open, stand up for each other.

{"_id":"St. Louis police kill gunman who ambushed officer","articleText":" (CNN)St. Louis Police have killed a gunman they say wounded an officer in a shooting ambush on Sunday.Authorities on Monday identified the suspect as 19-year-old George P. Bush III. Around 7:30 p.m. Sunday night, a gunman pulled up in a silver car next to a marked Chevy Tahoe and opened fire, St. Louis Police Department Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters. The shooting happened hours after a Texas cop was ambushed in a fatal shooting. Police there are still searching for a suspect.One officer, a 46-year-old sergeant and 20-year veteran of the force, was shot twice in the head but is expected to survive.\"This officer was not trying to pull this car over,\" Dotson said. \"This officer was driving down the road and was ambushed.\"The suspect, who fled the scene, led police on a manhunt that lasted into Monday morning. The St. Louis Police Department had called in special operations forces, SWAT units and helicopter units to assist in tracking down the gunman.Hours later, authorities fatally shot the gunman after he opened fire at officers. No other officers were injured. Staring down the barrel of the gunAccording to Dotson, the wounded officer's gun was still in a holster as the suspect pulled alongside the vehicle.The officer, who looked to his left, told investigators he saw the muzzle flash and felt the glass window shatter against him.After the shooting, the wounded sergeant called 911 dispatch on his radio. Soon, first responders arrived at the scene of the shooting and transported him to a nearby hospital.First San Antonio, now St. LouisEarlier in the day Sunday, a San Antonio police officer was fatally shot during a traffic stop. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus described the shooting as a targeted attack that resembled police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.To take precaution against further attacks, Dotson said all St. Louis officers will be partnered up on patrol for the foreseeable future. Mayor: 'This is traumatic'St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay noted that the wounded officer is a husband with three children and said he \"didn't deserve this.\" \"This is traumatic for him, his family, the city of St. Louis,\" Slay said.In a series of tweets, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon expressed his support for the officer and called the attack a \"reminder of dangerous job law enforcement officers have each day in protecting us.\"Police: Suspect responsible for string of crimesDotson said officers eventually tracked down the suspect as he was riding in a friend's car. When police tried to stop the vehicle, the gunman ran and fired one shot at a squad car. Officers then returned fire, striking and killing the suspect. St. Louis police officers recovered a pistol with a high-capacity magazine.After the shootout, Dotson told reporters early Monday the gunman was thought to have committed multiple robberies, a carjacking and potentially a homicide that had gone unsolved.Dotson said the gunman likely shot the officer Sunday night out of fear he would be recognized for his role in the recent string of crimes.The investigation is still ongoing, police said.CNN's Tony Marco and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/st-louis-police-shooting/index.html"}

{"_id":"Standing Rock protesters ordered out by Army Corps of Engineers","articleText":" (CNN)A new confrontation is brewing over the Dakota Access Pipeline.Protesters fighting pipeline construction must vacate property near the Cannonball River in North Dakota -- the location of a large campsite for demonstrators -- by December 5 or face arrest, the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday.\"This decision is necessary to protect the general public from the violent confrontation between protestors and law enforcement officials that have occurred in this area, and to prevent death, illness, or serious injury to inhabitants of encampments due to the harsh North Dakota winter conditions,\" Col. John Henderson of the Corps said in a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe leader.On Sunday, the Corps issued a new statement saying it wants a \"peaceful and orderly transition to a safer location, and has no plans for forcible removal.\"But, those who choose to stay \"do so at their own risk as emergency, fire, medical, and law enforcement response cannot be adequately provided in these areas,\" the statement added. \"Those who remain will be considered unauthorized and may be subject to citation under federal, state or local laws.\"A resolve that's 'stronger than ever'Tribal Chairman Cave Archambault II issued a statement blasting the Corps, but didn't say exactly how the tribe would respond.\"Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever,\" he said. \"The best way to protect people during the winter, and reduce the risk of conflict between water protectors and militarized police, is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing, and deny it now.\"The order comes five days after a violent protest flared as protesters tried to cross the Backwater Bridge and go north on Highway 1806, authorities said. The Morton County Sheriff's Office said protesters set fires while officers tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas, rubber bullets and water sprayed from hoses attached to fire engines. Temperatures were below freezing that night.The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says construction of the pipeline -- which is currently slated to run under the Missouri River -- could affect its drinking water supply and put communities living downstream \"at risk for contamination by crude oil leaks and spills.\"Protesters say the pipeline will threaten the environment and destroy Native American burial sites, prayer sites and culturally significant artifacts. Protests, arrests continueMultiple groups have joined the protests over the months. Activists have destroyed construction equipment as part of their protests, authorities say. More than 500 people have been arrested in the last month, the Morton County Sheriff's Office says. On Friday, 33 anti-pipeline protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespass after about 100 of them formed a prayer circle inside a Bismark mall, police said.Henderson said protesters can relocate to a \"free speech zone\" south of the river. He stressed public safety, saying it would be difficult for emergency medical services, firefighters and police to respond to calls coming from the campsite. Protesters have set up tents and kitchens on the property for more than a month.Archambault urged the public to ask President Obama and the Corps to change the pipeline route.\"It is both unfortunate and disrespectful that this announcement comes the day after this country celebrates Thanksgiving -- a historic exchange of goodwill between Native Americans and the first immigrants from Europe,\" he wrote. \"Although the news is saddening, it is not at all surprising given the last 500 years of the mistreatment of our people.\"The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which is set to cost $3.7 billion, would start in North Dakota, stretch across parts of South Dakota and Iowa, and end in southern Illinois. If completed, the pipeline would allow crude oil to be transported to oil refineries along the Eastern Seaboard.

{"_id":"Starbucks' menu, as selected by a nutritionist","articleText":"Lisa Drayer was once a public spokesperson for Starbucks, for a specific product and for a limited time in 2008-09. This was not disclosed when this story was first published. (CNN)You can't go too far these days without running into a Starbucks. The chain is so ubiquitous, it's almost like having an outsourced pantry staple available within a 5-mile radius (or a few city blocks) all day. You can always count on it for coffee, tea and some tasty bites to fuel you up in the morning or to tide you over until lunch or dinner. But if we can count on Starbucks to be \"there\" for us, what are the most nutritious options among so many different beverages, mini-meals and snacks? Starbucks makes it easy for us, especially when it comes to deciding what to drink. One of the most appealing aspects of Starbucks' menu is that you can customize your beverage to your liking. To order even a simple drink at Starbucks is to participate in some level of customization, when you take into account the size, temperature (hot or iced) and fat content of the milk. We really like this level of personalization, considering we all have different nutritional needs and preferences. When it comes to calories in Starbucks beverages, the count varies greatly. The lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee and tea. For example, a tall (12 ounce) brewed coffee has 5 calories, and the same size brewed tea has zero calories. The same size nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories, mostly from the milk. In general, if you want to enjoy some sweetness in your beverage but don't want to over-consume calories, you can ask for less syrup (i.e. fewer \"pumps\": Most hot espresso beverages contain three, four and five pumps of syrup for tall, grande and Venti, respectively). Even better, order your beverage \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup and without whipped cream. For example, a grande (16 ounce) vanilla latte with whole milk has 290 calories and 11 grams of fat (6 grams saturated). But the skinny version, with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup, has 120 calories and 0 grams of fat. Other lighter cold beverages include a tall Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea or an iced coffee, which are lightly sweetened and contain only 60 calories (both have zero calories if you omit the sweetener). Finally, if you are not willing to part with syrups or whipped cream -- or full-fat milk, for that matter -- choose the smallest size. A Venti (24 ounce) mocha Frappuccino containing whole milk, whipped cream, syrup and mocha sauce contains 520 calories and 10 grams, or about half a day's worth of saturated fat. But the mini size (10 ounce) version contains 190 calories and 4 grams of saturated fat. Still not dietetic, but significantly skinnier. Though you can customize a beverage to your liking at Starbucks, the same does not hold true for the chain's food. You can ask a barista to take something off of a sandwich -- bacon, for example -- and bagels and oatmeal are customizable with toppings and spreads. But that's about it when it comes to personalizing meals and snacks. Aside from breakfast foods and bakery items, Starbucks offers salad bowls; bistro boxes that contain fewer than 500 calories and are suited for different palates; and yogurt parfaits, which have fewer than 300 calories and provide 13 to 14 grams of protein. And it is trying to help. The chain reduced sodium by 20% for all breakfast sandwiches; however, some still have a lot fewer milligrams than others. And by the end of 2017, the company claims that all beverages will be free of artificial flavors. It is also committed to reducing average added sugar in some of the more indulgent beverages by 25% by the end of 2020.Here are the best Starbucks options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by our picks for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kidsOur picks: Breakfast: Egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich Lunch: PB&J on wheat bistro box Snack: Chocolate cake popBeverage: Vanilla crème with nonfat milk (8 ounces) or organic low-fat plain milk box (Horizon)We're not surprised to see that there is no specific children's menu at Starbucks. After all, kids generally don't go to Starbucks to eat -- or to consume coffee, for that matter. But if you find yourself needing a caffeine boost with kids in tow, there are some nutritious, kid-friendly options to consider, and they don't include items from the bakery section. We really like the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich and the PB&J on wheat bistro box, which has apple slices, string cheese and veggies with Greek yogurt dip. (We don't think kids will mind the chocolate-covered raisins, either). If your child is craving a sweet treat, the chocolate cake pop will be sure to please, and it won't top the calorie charts. When it comes to kid-friendly beverages, on a cold day, consider a vanilla crème with nonfat milk in lieu of hot chocolate. An 8-ounce cup has fewer calories (100) and more calcium (25%) than the same size nonfat hot chocolate without whipped cream, which has 140 calories and 20% calcium. We also like the organic low-fat milk boxes from the ready to drink cooler section of the store. For vegetarians Our picks: Breakfast: Strawberry Greek yogurt parfait, or egg and cheddar breakfast sandwichLunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella paniniBeverage: Café latte with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (16 ounces) Vegetarians can choose from a variety of protein-rich options at Starbucks. The Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt parfaits and the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich each have 14 grams of protein and provide 15% of your daily calcium needs. For lunch, we like the tasty roasted tomato and mozzarella panini with spinach and pesto. We would recommend the cheese and fruit bistro box too, since it's so portable, but it does contain about half a day's worth of saturated fat, from the cheese (10 grams). Pair any of the above with a tall (12 ounce) caffé latte with soy milk, which delivers 7 grams of protein and a third of your daily calcium needs. In warmer weather, an unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk will keep you cool. Note that you need to specify \"unsweetened\" iced coffee: A standard tall iced coffee contains three pumps of simple syrup; most syrups contain about 20 to 25 calories per pump. If you want some sweetness without extra sugar calories, you can ask for just one pump or sugar-free syrup instead. For vegansOur picks: Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or multigrain bagel Lunch: Hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl Snack: Hippeas far out fajitaBeverage: Caffé Misto with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with coconut milk (12 ounces) When it comes to options for vegans, the hearty blueberry oatmeal tops our list. It provides 5 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, which helps slow the post-meal rise in blood sugar, contributing to sustained energy throughout the morning. We are also impressed with the multigrain bagel, with 17 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber from ingredients including oats, flax and sunflower seeds. For comparison, Starbucks' plain bagel has 9 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. However, you will have to enjoy your bagel sans spreads, as there are no dairy-free spreads available to pair it with. The chain is testing an avocado spread in two markets, but it's not available nationwide just yet. For lunch, we highly recommend the hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl, a fiber and antioxidant-rich medley with butternut squash, beets, kale, broccoli and roasted tomatoes. If you avoid honey, skip the lemon-tahini dressing.  If you are in the mood for a snack, try \"hippeas\": protein-rich chickpea puffs that are certified vegan. To sip, a Caffé Misto with steamed soy milk will keep you warm in the winter. In summertime, an iced coffee with coconut milk is low in saturated fat and contributes 80 calories; however, save 60 calories by ordering it unsweetened. Note that while foods may be free of ingredients of animal origin, the chain is cautious about calling foods \"vegan\" unless they are packaged and \"certified vegan,\" as foods are subject to cross contamination.For calorie counters Our picks: Breakfast: Classic whole-grain oatmeal or reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich Lunch: Zesty chicken and black bean salad bowlBeverage: Nonfat cappuccino (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (12 ounces)If you are looking to shed pounds and are keeping a close eye on calories, you can't go wrong with choosing the classic whole-grain oatmeal. Without any toppings, it has 160 calories, 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of filling fiber. We recommend adding a bit of dried fruit to boost sweetness. The reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich with reduced-fat white cheddar cheese is also a filling, calorie-controlled option, with 16 grams of protein and only 230 calories. For lunch, the zesty chicken and black bean salad bowl is under 400 calories and offers a satisfying combination of protein and carbs, but we particularly like the fact that it has 8 grams of fiber, which fills you up without providing additional calories, as well as some appetite-suppressing spice from its chili vinaigrette. When it comes to beverages, the lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee (5 calories for a tall, or 12 ounces) and tea (zero calories, even for unsweetened Iced Passion Tango tea). Additionally, a tall café Americano has only 10 calories. It also depends how strictly you are watching calories. If you are on a 1,400- or 1,600-calorie diet, we understand you might prefer to eat your calories instead of drink them. However, if you have a little more wiggle room, a tall nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. Additionally, a tall iced coffee with nonfat milk that is lightly sweetened (with 3 pumps of syrup) has 80 calories, but if you order it with one pump of syrup, the count goes down to 35 calories. The unsweetened version is the lowest, at only 20 calories. And if you enjoy a flavored latte, order it \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup (the \"skinny\" definition also implies no whipped cream, where appropriate). For the sugar-sensitiveOur picks: Breakfast: Reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich or classic whole-grain oatmeal Lunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella panini Beverage: Café Americano (12 ounces) or unsweetened Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea (16 ounces)The first step in slashing sugar calories at Starbucks is to skip over the bakery items, Venti (20-ounce) flavored lattes and Frappuccinos. The next step is to check out the hot breakfast menu, which offers some of the lowest-sugar options at the chain, such as the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich, with 2 grams of sugar, and the reduced-fat turkey bacon sandwich, with 3 grams of sugar. The classic whole-grain oatmeal has zero grams of sugar without any toppings, but you might want to add some dried fruit or nuts, which are optional. There are many low-sugar options for lunch at Starbucks, but the sodium levels are too high for our comfort level. We recommend the tomato and mozzarella panini, which has only 3 grams of sugar. Pair it with unsweetened coffee, espresso or tea to keep sugar grams at a minimum. And when it comes to sweet drinks without extra sugar calories, choose \"skinny\" or light versions of your favorites.For the salt-sensitiveOur picks: Breakfast or lunch (mini-meal): Fresh blueberries and honey Greek yogurt parfait Snack: Seasonal harvest fruit blendBeverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces) or iced skinny flavored latte (16 ounces)If you are looking for a mini-meal and watching salt intake, Starbucks' Greek yogurt parfaits come in tasty blueberry, strawberry and dark sweet cherry combinations and are by far the lowest-sodium menu items at the chain, ranging from 65 to 75 milligrams per parfait. We especially like the blueberry and honey parfait, as the blue fruit is loaded with anthocyanins, which protect against aging. The yogurt is also rich in potassium, which can help to blunt the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium. The classic whole-grain and hearty blueberry oatmeals are also low-sodium breakfast options, with 125 milligrams each. When it comes to lunch, there is nothing on the Starbucks sandwich, panini and salad menu that is under 600 milligrams of sodium, and bistro boxes range from 460 to 830 milligrams of sodium, so the yogurt parfait is still the best option if you are closely watching sodium intake. For a snack, the seasonal harvest fruit blend is sodium-free and is a healthful add-on to any meal, as it contributes antioxidants and fiber, for only 90 calories. To sip, we like the grande (16-ounce) nonfat latte, as it offers almost half of our daily calcium needs and adds even more potassium to the meal. An iced skinny latte is a sweet, calcium-rich option during warmer months.For the gluten-sensitiveOur picks: Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or strawberry Greek yogurt parfaitLunch: Hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowlSnack: Kale chips, zesty nachoBeverage: Nonfat latte macchiato (12 ounces) or iced café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces)You won't find much success if you are specifically looking for \"gluten-free\" items at Starbucks. The only gluten-free-labeled product we could find is a gluten-free marshmallow dream bar. There is no dedicated section for allergen information on the company's website, so you have to navigate carefully if you are allergic to gluten, or wheat or milk, for that matter. Starbucks cautiously maintains that its food is handled in an open environment and is subject to cross-contamination. However, some meals such as the hearty blueberry or classic whole-grain oatmeal, Greek strawberry yogurt parfait, or hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowl are nutritious options that do not have gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, if you are avoiding gluten, you won't be surprised to learn that the chain's scones, cakes and muffins are off-limits. But you can enjoy a bag of zesty nacho kale chips, which have 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber to keep you satisfied. Since gluten is generally not an issue when it comes to beverages (that is, except for the java chip Frappuccino, which contains cookie crumbs), we decided to list some of our favorites, such as the nonfat latte macchiato and the nonfat iced café latte, for their bone-building calcium.For the athleteOur picks: Breakfast: Spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap or hearty blueberry oatmealLunch: Egg salad sandwichBeverage: Organic low-fat chocolate milk box (Horizon) or strawberry smoothie with non-fat milk (16 ounces)Starbucks' spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap offers 19 grams of protein, which is a welcome dose for weight lifters, and has plenty of carbs to fuel a light cardio workout. Athletes can also fuel up with the hearty blueberry oatmeal. For lunch, we like the protein and iron-rich egg salad sandwich. The sandwich delivers 42 grams of carbs, which is especially beneficial post-workout. When it comes to a post-workout beverage, the choice depends on the intensity and duration of the workout. For a low-intensity workout, like a brisk walk, Pilates or yoga, water is fine. For a morning jog, low-fat chocolate milk offers adequate carbs and protein, along with electrolytes lost in sweat, like sodium and potassium. If you are training for a marathon, feel free to grab Starbucks' strawberry smoothie, which provides a generous amount of carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen stores, as well as 16 grams of protein, which provides amino acids for muscle building and repair. For the road warriorOur picks: Breakfast: Ham and cheese savory foldoverLunch: Protein bistro box Snack: Kind bar, blueberry vanilla and cashewBeverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or cool lime Starbucks Refreshers beverage (12 ounces)If you are on the road, our guess is that you might want to grab a quick bite from Starbucks' bakery counter. If that's the case, consider the ham and cheese savory foldover. Unlike many of the chain's bakery items, this croissant has fewer than 300 calories and offers 13 grams of protein, which will satisfy you for a morning road trip. We are also pleased to see it has less than 500 milligrams of sodium). For lunch, we like the protein bistro box that is packed with easy-to-nibble foods including a hard-boiled egg, apple slices, cheddar cheese, muesli bread and peanut butter. For long drives, grab a Kind bar, which will come in handy when hunger pangs begin to distract. For a road trip on a hot summer day, a tall lime Starbucks Refresher is a welcome treat: It has a third of the calories of a typical lemonade and is lightly caffeinated with green coffee extract to keep you alert on the road.For the carb-consciousOur picks: Breakfast: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes)Lunch: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes)Snack: Squirrel Black truffle almondsBeverage: Caffé Misto with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or iced café Americano (16 ounces)If you're on a low-carb diet, Starbucks is not going to be at the top of the list for a bite to eat. The lowest-carb foods we could find on its food nutrition menu is the Frappuccino cookie straw, at 14 grams, and the petite vanilla bean scone, with 18 grams of carbs. So your best bet is to get the protein bistro box with a hard-boiled egg, cheddar cheese and peanut butter. Feel free to enjoy some apple slices too, but the muesli bread won't make the low-carb cut. If you subtract both the bread and grapes from the meal, the carb count goes down from 37 grams to 11 grams. For a low-carb snack, heart-healthy almonds are available, though if you are watching calories too, stick to a half portion, as a full serving contains 270 calories. When it comes to drinks, keep in mind that any beverage containing milk will include carbs from naturally occurring lactose, and we encourage you to include milk in your morning beverage to get an that calcium boost. A tall (12-ounce) Caffé Misto with steamed nonfat milk has only 8 grams of carbs and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. If you are looking for a low-carb beverage without milk, a café Americano (hot or iced) will satisfy. You can add a pump of sugar-free syrup and whipped cream without making a dent in the carb content, though in that case, we recommend a tall size, as doing so boosts calories and saturated fat.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/health/starbucks-menu-nutritionist/index.html"}
{"_id":"Starchy enters race to be the sixth taste","articleText":" (CNN)Scientists have long known that the human tongue can detect five basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness and \"umami,\" or savory.However, a small study published in the journal Chemical Senses last month suggests that a sixth taste should be added to that list -- starchiness -- and this newly identified taste may shed light on why we enjoy eating carb-heavy foods such as pizza and pasta.\"We are taught that humans can taste only five taste categories,\" said Juyun Lim, associate professor at Oregon State University's Department of Food Science and Technology and lead author of the study. \"It seems, however, that we can taste other chemicals that comprise foods such as starch degradation products and fatty acids.\" Lim added that some compounds, such as starch, are abundant in nature and that we use them as a source of energy. \"Understanding how we can detect and recognize our food sources is very important since it will directly impact our ingestive behavior and health,\" she said.The elusive starchy tasteThe study involved five separate experiments and about 100 adult participants. The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked. The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally \"starchy.\"\"It has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,\" Lim said. \"At the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.\" The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.For instance, \"as much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,\" Lim said.As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.\"It is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,\" said Dr. Robert Margolskee, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \"Mechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor ... or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,\" he said.Other candidates for the sixth tasteIt isn't the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste. Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in the journal Chemical Senses that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in grouping the fatty acids together and separately from the other solutions.This newly identified fatty taste was named \"oleogustus\" in the study, as the Latin term \"oleo\" is a root for oily or fatty and \"gustus\" refers to taste.\"We believe the evidence base for fat is now substantial and acceptance is growing,\" said Richard Mattes, distinguished professor of nutrition science and director of the public health graduate program at Purdue, who was a co-author of the 2015 study.\"The idea that taste may not be limited to a few primary qualities is now seriously discussed.\" However, as some scientists continue the hunt for a sixth taste, others stand by the existing list of five, which was last updated in 2007 when umami was declared a fifth taste system.\"There are several other candidates for the sixth taste, including calcium, fat, carbon dioxide and even water,\" said Gary Beauchamp, a biologist and emeritus director and president of the Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the new study.\"In my mind, none of them have the perceptual salience of the main four -- now five -- sweet, sour, salty and bitter, and the recently recognized umami, which is a bit more subtle than the traditional four but still distinctive,\" he said.Bon appétit.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html"}

{"_id":"Stranded humpback whale in New York is euthanized","articleText":" (CNN)After spending days stuck in shallow waters off the coast of Long Island, a humpback whale grew sicker and thinner. Veterinarians euthanized the 20-ton creature Wednesday afternoon in Moriches Bay as crowds gathered, some crying over the dying whale. The whale had become \"minimally responsive\" and had signs of \"neurological abnormalities and extensive skin injuries with evidence of infection.\" \"Based upon these findings, the most humane option was to euthanize the whale since its chance of surviving in the wild was minimal,\" according to a joint veterinary team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and private researchers. The whale had been spotted feeding in Moriches Bay on November 13, according to the Riverhead Foundation, which was involved in assessing the creature. The whale eventually got stuck in Hart's Cove, where the water is about one to two feet deep, according to NOAA. Attempts to free the whale off the sandbar and to create waves to help it swim away failed. \"The tidal conditions and other oceanic or biological factors that led to this stranding overtook any ability by our responders to rescue it,\" said John Bullard, director of NOAA's Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, in a statement.But some residents who saw the ailing whale criticized NOAA and the Riverhead Foundation for not acting quickly enough. The whale's body had protruded from the shallow water as seagulls pecked away at it. One resident told CNN affiliate WPIX that they could hear a \"baby crying sound\" from the whale during its ordeal. \"You go down there and your heart wrenches for this thing,\" another resident told CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island.Residents tried to hatch their own plan to free the humpback but were turned away by officials, the station reported.Federal law requires people to stay at least 50 yards away from wild marine mammals including humpbacks. NOAA had urged the public not to interact with the whale in distress.\"Efforts to haul whales off beaches can cause more harm to the animal as strong pressure on the tail or flippers can result in internal injuries, and put people involved at risk,\" it said in a statement. Large whales get stranded when they're sick or malnourished, according to NOAA. \"Thus, refloating a large whale may not be in its best interest, as it is already sick.\"A necropsy will be performed on the whale. This fall, humpback whales have been spotted several times in the New York Harbor, including one frolicking in the Hudson River.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/us/humpback-whale-euthanized-trnd/index.html"}

{"_id":"Study: Don't be swayed by independent restaurants when trying to cut calories","articleText":" (CNN)Many chain restaurants and fast-food joints now post calorie information on their menus, even before they will be required to by federal law at the end of 2016, making it obvious how calorie-laden their meals can be. Non-chain restaurants are often seen as the healthier choice, even though -- or perhaps because -- the number of calories in their meals is a mystery. But a new study finds that these meals are generally just as calorie-rich as similar meals at chain restaurants.Researchers determined the calorie content of the most popular dinners at independent eateries around Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock, Arkansas. In each area, they included about a dozen restaurants across a range of cuisines, from American burger joints to Italian trattorias and Greek cafes.The researchers determined the average dinner at a non-chain restaurant had about 1,200 calories, which they found was similar to comparable dinners at chain restaurants and around half of the daily energy requirement for adults. Women are recommended to consume about 2,000 calories a day to maintain their weight, whereas men can reach about 2,500 calories a day.\"Many nutritionists say fast food is making us obese, but that's just because they tell us their calories. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Non-chain restaurants are just as bad as chain restaurants,\" said Susan B. Roberts, director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Roberts led the research, which was published Wednesday in the Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics.\"I think chain restaurants are better personally because you can make informed choices,\" she said.Roberts and her colleagues found a lot of variability between different types of cuisines. American, Italian, Chinese and Indian meals had the most calories on average, whereas Greek, Vietnamese and Mexican tended to have the fewest.Across the range of cuisines, 92% of the dinners the researchers tested contained more than 570 calories, which they consider the appropriate number of calories for the average adult woman to consume at lunch and dinner. \"All of the popular choices have grossly excessive numbers of calories,\" Roberts said.One of the unexpected findings for Roberts was that dishes she has recommended to her clients, such as grilled chicken tikka at Indian restaurants, were much higher in calories at some restaurants. \"They must be soaking the chicken in oil or yogurt because it has 200 or 300 more calories between restaurants,\" she said. It would be hard for consumers to notice the difference, she added. The findings were surprising in general, said Marian Jarlenski, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. \"The intuitive hypothesis is that non-chains would be healthier. This may be an American thing; we think local is better, and better in this case might be healthier,\" she said.Jarlenski was particularly struck by the finding that meals with the smallest portion sizes were not necessarily low in calories. \"My personal strategy is to eat whatever I want as long as it's (a small portion), but I may be getting just as many calories if I'm ordering something that has a lot of calorie-dense ingredients,\" she said.What consumers can doThe number of calories served at a restaurant is an important issue because Americans eat out so much. One estimate is that the average American adult eats meals or snacks at restaurants about six times a week. \"The weight of the evidence suggests that restaurant eating is a contributor to obesity in the United States,\" Jarlenski said.\"Consumers should be aware to eat out in moderation ... restaurant eating is most likely not going to be as healthy as cooking with fresh ingredients at home,\" Jarlenski said. For her part, Roberts thinks that advising people not to eat out so much is like \"telling the tide not to rise.\" \"People like eating out, and it's likely to become even more frequent. We need ways to help people deal with it better,\" she said.One of the easy things that consumers can do is ask for cheese and dressing on the side when they order. \"You can just sprinkle a little on. A lot of the calories come from these high-calorie add-ons,\" Roberts said.It is also possible to curb how much you eat and get a doggie bag for leftovers, but many of us do not have this kind of willpower.  \"The easiest solution is if you say up front (to the server), 'I'd like to take a half-portion and you can give me the other portion to take home,' but it's kind of embarrassing unless you know the people you eat out with well,\" she said.Should non-chain restaurants post calorie information? Although it may help consumers to get calorie information at independent restaurants just like at chain restaurants, \"I don't think simply disclosing (this information) is going to have a huge effect,\" Roberts said. Although it could steer some toward lower-calorie options, people with less money may order the largest number of calories they can afford, she said.In addition, \"providing the caloric content information might affect restaurant behavior rather than consumer behavior,\" such as spurring restaurants to make their meals healthier or make their portions smaller, Jarlenski said.Roberts says the impact of restaurants offering smaller portions -- such as half- or third-portions, for half or a third of the price -- should be explored. \"Restaurants will say, 'We can't possibly do that,' but if everyone were required (by law) to do that, the playing field (would be) level,\" she said. \"I would eat out every night of the week if I could do that.\" Although Roberts doubts the calorie load at non-chain restaurants in other parts of the United States would be much better, it is hard to say how eateries in other cities and in rural areas would stack up.The three cities in the study -- Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock -- differ in their demographics and their obesity rates. \"I would have thought that San Francisco (restaurants) would be better than Boston and Little Rock ... because San Francisco is one of the lowest-BMI cities,\" Jarlenski said.That just goes to show that many other factors, in addition to calories in restaurant food, contribute to obesity rates, such as how often people go out to eat and how much exercise they get, she added.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/health/non-chain-restaurants-calories-fast-food/index.html"}

{"_id":"Summers: Trump's economic plans could 'cripple government for a generation'","articleText":"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to implement major tax cuts and roll back oversight of the financial industry risk triggering another economic crisis and crippling the country for a generation, warns former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.  \"The idea that we would repeal Dodd-Frank\" -- the landmark financial reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis -- \"I think that would be a catastrophic kind of error,\" Summers told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files\" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.Allowing that some portions of the 2010 law could be altered and improved, Summers said gutting it, as Trump and his advisers have signaled they will do, is a \"very, very scary\" notion that, if carried out, \"would be taking immense and systemic risks of another financial crisis.\"\"Right now, the dangers are all on the side of the pendulum swinging too far back [towards deregulation] -- and I think that's very scary,\" said Summers.Turning to Trump's tax proposals, which independent analysts say will skew toward the wealthy and cause massive budget deficits, Summers agreed there was no way to put the tax plan into effect without adding large levels of new debt. But, he said, the long term implications are what he finds most troubling.\"What I'm worried about is that we're going to do tax cuts that are going to cripple government for a generation,\" Summers stated. Pointing to the potential repeal of the estate tax as an example, he argued that its repeal would only compel the wealthiest Americans to protect those savings in family trusts.Summers, who served not only as President Bill Clinton's treasury secretary but also as President Barack Obama's National Economic Council director, helping to navigate the country through the financial crisis, said that the country's biggest challenge today is putting people back to work in this advanced, global economy.Summers pointed out that 1-in-7 prime-age America men are currently out of work, a trend that threatens to grow to 1-in-3 men in the next 30 years. \"I think that finding work for everyone is going to be the central challenge of our politics over the next generation,\" Summers said, before arguing for the implementation of a modernized education system and a boon of targeted infrastructure projects, which he says is different in crucial respects from Trump's current infrastructure proposal.\"I think the government is going to have to take a much larger role in assuring that everybody's prepared for work,\" Summers continued.Summers also contended that the Democratic party should worry as much about half the population that cannot attend college as it does for the people who can go but have trouble affording it.\"If we're going to be progressive and if we're going to commit ourselves to the people who traditionally have been the constituency of the Democratic party,\" stated Summers, \"I want to see what we're going to do to support the transition to work and the transition to adulthood for the people who don't have a chance to go to college or the people who don't choose to go to college.\"I think that is a huge imperative for us going forward,\" he concluded.To hear the whole conversation with Summers, which also covered what it was like to grow up in a family of renowned economists, what actions he believes did and did not cause the 2008 financial crisis, how and why he began advising politicians on economic matters, and much more, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

{"_id":"Sunnis outraged by Iraq law legalizing Shiite-led militias ","articleText":"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)Sunni politicians raised an alarm Monday after the Iraqi Parliament passed a law recognizing Iraq's Shiite-led Hashad al-Shabbi, known as the Popular Mobilization Units, or PMU, as an independent military force. The more than 110,000 strong fighting group has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS in Iraq.  Its role is critical but controversial with human rights groups, which allege the units have committed atrocities in the battlefield against the minority Sunni population.  The bill, officially passed Saturday, makes the units an independent entity of the Iraqi Armed Forces that answers directly to the Prime Minister. Under the new rules, the units will be overseen by the Popular Mobilization Unit Committees, or PMUC.   Critics argue this effectively legitimizes a militia, which does not maintain the same standards of training or battlefield conduct as the national military. Of the 328-seat Parliament, 208 voted in favor of the law. A majority of the Sunni members boycotted and left the chamber.  \"I believe this committee has been politically motivated and it will have similar impact as Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and aims to weaken the Iraqi army,\" Raad al Dahlaki, a Sunni member of  Parliament, said Monday.  \"We should definitely support and show appreciation to Popular Mobilization Units, but there is absolutely no need for an alternative force separate from the Iraqi army and police,\" he said. Battle for Mosul Many fear the ongoing battle to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, will reignite sectarian tensions and inflame calls of autonomy from various religious and ethnic groups.  Sunni politicians say the legislation is part of a continuing trend by the Shiite-led Baghdad government to sideline their interests in the country's political future. \"We have expressed our rejections to this law but they did not listen to us,\" Osama al-Nujaifi, Iraq's Sunni vice president, said in a press conference Saturday. \"The majority does not have the right to determine the fate of everyone else.\" Those who defend the law say it brings the units under the purview of the government, which means more oversight and greater accountability.  \"If this law had not passed, we would be worried that we could end up with various militant groups who are not under the umbrella of the military committee,\" said Adnan al-Assadi, a Shiite member of Parliament. Assadi argued the law will unify Iraq's various fighting factions and pointed to the percentage of Sunni fighters in the units as an example of diversity. Some 9,000 Sunni fighters are part of the PMU, said Ahmed al-Assadi, a PMU spokesman.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also welcomed the new law and said the fighting force \"will represent and defend all Iraqis wherever they are.\"The PMU's forces have been fighting ISIS militants in Iraq since 2014. They are made up of dozens of militia groups affiliated with various political parties. Some have varying degrees of support from the Shiite-run government in Tehran. The new law requires the PMU to end loyalties and affiliations with all political parties. The head of each division and any higher-ranking commanders within the PMU now must be approved by the Iraqi Parliament.In October, the Iraqi government announced the military offensive to retake Mosul from ISIS. Human Rights Watch called on Iraqi commanders to prevent the PMU from taking part in the planned operation, citing a record of abuses against the Sunni population, including summary killings, enforced disappearances, torture and the destruction of homes.The Prime Minister has said repeatedly the PMU will not be allowed to enter the city of Mosul but will participate in other battles in Nineveh province.  Thousands of fighters are engaged in an offensive to wrest control of Tal Afar from ISIS. The 50,000 predominantly Sunni resident say they fear the forces will enter the city and carry out retribution killings.

{"_id":"Supreme Court ruling makes insider trading cases easier to prosecute","articleText":" (CNN)The Supreme Court made it easier to prosecute some insider trading cases Tuesday, upholding the conviction of a man who traded information based on a tip.It had been two decades since the court weighed in on insider trading, and lawyers for Bassam Salman argued he could not be prosecuted because the man who provided the original tip had not benefited financially when he provided the information.But a unanimous Supreme Court upheld Salman's conviction and ruled in favor of the government by affirming the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.The Supreme Court's ruling resolves an apparent conflict between two lower courts — the 2nd Circuit and the 9th Circuit -- on the issue of gift giving. It also gives a victory to US Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York, who was on the losing end of the 2nd circuit decision in 2014.Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the Court, said that precedent specifies that when a tipper gives inside information to a \"trading relative or friend\" the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent of a cash gift.\"In such situations, the tipper benefits personally because giving a gift of trading information is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds,\" he said.Bharara was quick to praise the decision.\"In its swiftly decided opinion, the Court stood up for common sense and affirmed what we have been arguing from the outset — that the law absolutely prohibits insiders from advantaging their friends and relatives at the expense of the trading public,\" he said in a statement.\"Today's decision is a victory for fair markets and those who believe that the system should not be rigged,\" he said.The facts in Tuesday's case concerned Maher Kara who was an investment banker at Citigroup and dealt with highly confidential information. He discussed aspects of his job with his brother Michael. Ultimately it was Michael who shared information with Salman. Salman was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Both Maher and Michael pleaded guilty and testified at Salman's trial.\"The Supreme Court's decision Tuesday reverses the government's loss in 2014 when it comes to gifts of confidential information to friends and relatives,\"  said Eric Rieder of Bryan Cave.\"It was a narrow opinion in the sense that the Court believed this case was clearly covered by court precedent,\" he said.

{"_id":"Supreme Court tackles racial gerrymander cases","articleText":"Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Monday tackled two racial gerrymander cases in a fresh attempt to determine how race can be taken into consideration when states draw district lines.The justices heard arguments for more than two hours concerning maps in North Carolina and Virginia. In a sign of the complexity of the cases, the justices did something they don't usually do: They allowed the arguing attorneys to go on for extended periods of time without interruption.\"This is all,\" Justice Samuel Alito said at one point, \"very, very complicated.\" As is often the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy could prove to be a critical vote. At one point, he expressed reservation about a lower court opinion that went in favor of the Virginia plans. Monday's case represents another example of how the recent presidential election could profoundly impact the future of the Supreme Court. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of voting rights and vowed to nominate a justice who would work to reverse the impact of Shelby County v. Texas, a 2013 5-4 decision that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.But Donald Trump is likely to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia with a like-minded conservative. If Trump were to get the opportunity to fill a second seat, he could further solidify the Shelby majority. On Monday, civil rights groups and Democrats came to court to challenge plans they said unnecessarily packed African-Americans into districts with the aim of diluting minority presence in neighboring districts. Mark Elias, a lawyer challenging the plans who also served as Clinton's top election lawyer, said the maps were drawn to diminish minority voters' impact in electing candidates of their choice. But Paul Clement — a lawyer for the states -- defended the plans, arguing that the states find themselves in a bind, often seeking a sweet spot between federal law and constitutional requirements. On the one hand, the Voting Rights Act requires that the legislature take race into consideration when drawing lines. At the same time, the court has said that the Equal Protection Clause prevents race from being the dominant factor in those decisions absent a compelling justification. Kennedy's comments suggested a discomfort with race being used as a tipping point without the proper scrutiny.\"I have a problem with that,\" he said at one point. In 2015, Kennedy voted with his liberal colleagues in a case out of Alabama concerning how districts could be drawn. But he also voted with the majority in Shelby County. The first case, Bethune Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, deals with a Virginia legislative map that was redrawn in 2010 after the census. Twelve districts for the State House of Delegates were drawn to attain a 55% Black Voting Age population. Critics argue that the maps pack African-Americans in the district and dilute their presence in other districts. A lower court upheld the districts, saying that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts and in the 12th there was a permissible justification to have race predominate. The second case concerns two federal congressional district maps that were drawn in North Carolina to ensure that each had a Black Voting Age population of 50%.In that case, a lower court said the maps were unconstitutional. Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, who filed a brief in support of the challengers, rejected any argument that the states are caught between a rock and a hard place. \"The reality is it is not difficult to comply with both the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,\" she said. \"All you need to do is avoid racial quotas and look at political realities on the ground in each district.\" ","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandered-districts/index.html"}

Justices have previously ruled that the execution of the intellectually disabled violates the Constitution, but the court has largely left it up to the states to implement the ruling.Tuesday, the four liberal justices -- joined critically by Justice Anthony Kennedy -- seemed to indicate that a Texas court had relied upon the wrong standards in ruling against the inmate, Bobby James Moore. A lawyer for Moore argued that Texas had \"adopted a unique approach\" and urged the Supreme Court to reverse the decision. Supporters of Moore hope that the court's eventual ruling will bring Texas -- a state that has executed more people than any other state since 1976 -- in line with Supreme Court precedent.\"I think there is a conflict,\" Kennedy said at one point, between the standards used by the lower court and current medical standards. Moore was convicted of the 1980 murder of James McCarble, an employee at the Birdsall Super Market in Houston. His lawyer, Clifford M. Sloan, argued that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was mistaken when it ruled that Moore was eligible for the death penalty because it based its decision on an outdated medical definition of intellectual disability.    Sloan pointed out that throughout his childhood Moore had \"grave difficulties\" with academic, social and conceptual issues.In court papers Sloan said Moore's own father called him \"'stupid' for being slow to read and speak, and his teachers separated him from the rest of the class, often instructing him to draw pictures because he was unable to keep up with basic schoolwork.\" Moore was also hit in the head with a brick when he was 12 during an integration dispute that took place in his school. The Texas court acknowledged that the position of the medical community on the diagnosis of intellectual disability has shifted in recent years, but said that \"until the legislature acts\" it is bound by its own precedent. The lower court relied on a 1992 manual put out by the American Association on Mental Retardation that includes a three part test: significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, deficits in adaptive functioning (how one handles the demands of every day life,)  and whether the disability was present in childhood. But Sloan said the standard, fashioned in part on a fictional character in John Steinbeck's novel \"Of Mice and Men,\" did not reflect current medical standards. Sloan said that \"refinements have occurred with regard to both intellectual function and adaptive behavior.\" He argued that \"current standards place greatly reduced emphasis on IQ scores in the assessment of intellectual function and rely more on adaptive functioning\" than earlier standards did. In court papers Scott Keller, Texas' Solicitor General, argued that the state is not required to \"adhere precisely to a particular organization's clinical definition of intellectual disability.\" He told the justices that the factors the lower court relied upon were \"grounded in court precedent.\" But Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether the lower court's rejection of the views of clinicians on some issues might mean \"people with mild impairment can be executed, even though the clinicians would find those people to be intellectually disabled.\" Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be the most solid vote for Texas. At one point he questioned whether the criteria used by the lower court was indeed outdated. All eyes in court were on Justice Stephen Breyer who has urged the court to take on the larger question concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty in part because it can be applied arbitrarily nationwide. While Moore's case did not target the large constitutional question, Breyer expressed concern that the court might not be able to find a standard that would settle borderline intellectual disability cases nationwide. \"I don't think there is a way to apply this kind of standard uniformly across the country, and therefore there will be disparities and uncertainties,\" he said.

{"_id":"Suspect charged with manslaughter in Joe McKnight shooting death ","articleText":" (CNN)Days after the suspect in the fatal shooting of ex-NFL player Joe McKnight was released, sparking allegations of racial bias by police, the Jefferson Parish sheriff announced Tuesday that Ronald Gasser was back in custody, charged with manslaughter. Sheriff Newell Normand said his investigators had identified 260 possible witnesses, interviewing more than 160 of them, since Thursday's apparent road rage incident that left the former pro running back and Louisiana high school standout dead in the streets of a New Orleans suburb. They also spoke to 70 business owners in an attempt to procure video, none of which showed the shooting, he said. Key witnesses were located on Saturday and Monday evening, Normand said, and they might not have come forward had authorities rushed forward with an arrest to appease critics of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.\"It's not about the right thing. It's not about justice. It's not about the process. It's about what we want and what we want now, and we don't care who we disparage in the process,\" Normand said with a pound of the podium, encapsulating the attitudes of his department's critics.As for the charge, Normand said the evidence in the case pointed to manslaughter, which Louisiana law states is a homicide \"committed in sudden passion or heat of blood immediately caused by provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection.\"He thanked McKnight's family members and credited their attitudes with the \"calm in the community\" following Gasser's release from custody Friday. \"Thank you for your patience, your restraint and your trust in the process,\" he said. Sheriff: Time led to arrestNormand said releasing Gasser last week helped investigators put together the case they have now. Gasser agreed to be interviewed for 12 hours without an attorney and consented to a search of his home for which investigators never could have obtained probable cause. Police also were able to conduct multiple crime scene re-enactments and consult with the district attorney's office, he said. The extra time allowed investigators to dispel bogus witness statements, including accounts that Gasser shot through McKnight's windshield, pulled McKnight out of his Audi, shot McKnight while he was on the ground, used the N-word and boasted that he had voted for President-elect Donald Trump. Another impediment to a quick arrest, he said, was Louisiana's self-defense laws, which demand that police \"get it right,\" he said. \"We have a very forward-leaning stand your ground, self-defense, justifiable homicide law, however you want to refer to it,\" the sheriff said. To those who would criticize his investigators or say they don't know what they're doing, Normand replied, \"Tough. I don't care. Because what I know is I can put my head on the pillow every night knowing we did the right things for the right reasons.\" The sheriff devoted more time in his Tuesday news conference to defending his investigation and deriding its critics than he did to details of the case. At one point, he read off a list of profane pejoratives directed at him, his officers and their defenders, including \"Uncle Tom,\" \"puppet\" and \"white boy.\" At one point, he repeated the N-word and a slur used against gay people as among the other epithets. He also cited black-on-black killings as a bigger problem in the parish than race-based killings. Denial that case not about raceNormand reiterated his assertion from last week that the case has nothing to do with race despite Gasser, 54, being white and McKnight, 28, black. It was more about \"two people engaged in bad behavior,\" he said. According to witness statements and evidence, he said, the altercation began on the Crescent City Connection that crosses the Mississippi River, between New Orleans and Terrytown, where the shooting occurred. McKnight, driving his stepfather's Audi Q7, cut off Gasser, who gave chase, Normand said. The two verbally engaged each other, rode each other's tails, zipped around other vehicles and cut each other off, the sheriff said. At a Terrytown intersection, Gasser got in front of McKnight, who pulled along the passenger side of Gasser's Infiniti G37 sedan. Gasser was \"hemmed in\" by other cars and had no \"avenue for retreat,\" Normand said. With their windows down, the verbal altercation continued until McKnight exited his vehicle. Gasser pulled a gun from between his seat and console and fired three shots through his passenger window at McKnight, the sheriff said. He then exited his car and took a \"police sweeping position\" before a naval officer convinced him to put his gun away, he said.  McKnight was shot in the right shoulder, the right chest and the hand, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said.Gasser handed over a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun to police and admitted shooting McKnight, Normand said last week. McKnight's stepfather's gun was in the Audi, Normand said Tuesday, but there is no evidence suggesting McKnight told Gasser he had a gun or threatened to retrieve it. The case is \"still maturing,\" the sheriff said, and it's possible evidence could surface that would prompt investigators to elevate or downgrade the charges against Gasser. Suspect, city historyIn 2006, Gasser was involved in a road rage incident and was charged with a misdemeanor, but it was dismissed, the sheriff's office said. The charge came after a man reported Gasser followed him into a gas station parking lot, got out and punched him several times. Court records show Gasser failed to show for his arraignment in September 2006 and later paid a fine for contempt. On November 27, the case was dismissed, court records show. Though McKnight, a Kenner resident, spent his professional years with the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, he grew up playing football in River Ridge, a 30-minute drive from Terrytown. He was named Louisiana's \"Mr. Football\" in 2006, and The Times-Picayune newspaper named him the male high school athlete of the decade in 2009.McKnight went on to play at the University of Southern California before being drafted in 2010 by New York, where he played until 2012. He sat out 2013, played 2014 with the Chiefs and 2015 with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Several NFL stars, including Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan and Bills running back Reggie Bush, spoke highly of McKnight and said they were saddened by his death\"Joe will be remembered for a lot of good things and I was proud to have known him and proud to have coached him,\" Ryan wrote on the Bills' website. Last week's shooting marks the second time this year a former pro football player was killed in a road rage incident in southern Louisiana. In April, Will Smith, who played defensive end for the New Orleans Saints, was shot to death and his wife was wounded in downtown New Orleans, apparently after a traffic dispute with another man, authorities said. Cardell Hayes was charged with second-degree murder in Smith's death.CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Suspect got married after San Antonio cop's killing","articleText":" (CNN)Just one day after he is alleged to have killed a San Antonio police officer, and hours before he was arrested, Otis Tyrone McKane got married.Documents obtained by CNN show that McKane was married Monday,  a day after San Antonio police Detective Benjamin Marconi was shot dead.McKane, 31, was arrested just hours after his marriage on suspicion of killing Marconi. Police say they believe Marconi was killed specifically because he was a law enforcement officer.The name of the person McKane married was redacted in the documents CNN received. A marriage license was issued at the Bexar County Clerk's Office at 9:57 a.m. CT Monday, the documents show.A judge then performed the ceremony, said Priscilla Hernandez of the Bexar County Clerk's Office.Around that time, San Antonio police were publicizing surveillance video, recorded Sunday, of the man they believed shot Marconi, but did not release a name. The video showed a man seen inside police headquarters four hours before the shooting and a car leaving the scene, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.Marconi, 50, was shot at close range Sunday before noon as he wrote a traffic ticket outside of police headquarters. Police arrested McKane late Monday afternoon. A SWAT team stopped him as he was riding with a woman and a 2-year-old child on Interstate 10, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said.McKane already has offered an apology to the dead officer's family. As he was being escorted out of the police department after his arrest, reporters asked him why he had been upset. \"Society not allowing me to see my son,\" McKane replied. \"I lashed out at somebody who didn't deserve it.\"\"I've been through several custody battles and I was upset at the situation I was in.\"When asked if he had anything to say to Marconi's family, he replied: \"I'm sorry,\" as he was escorted away. The shootingPolice say Marconi had pulled over a driver on the south side of the police station on Sunday and returned to his patrol car to write a ticket.That's when a man pulled up behind him. The man walked up to the patrol car driver's side window and shot the officer in the head, McManus said. The man then reached through the open window and shot him a second time, he said.After the shooting, the man returned to his vehicle and drove away.Officers found McKane by using videos and information turned up by the investigation, the chief said. They kept him under surveillance for several hours, police said. It wasn't immediately clear if that surveillance covered McKane's visit to the courthouse for the wedding. \"Based on the actions of this individual prior to the shooting, we have a fairly good video documentation of what he was doing,\" McManus said. \"I am still convinced that he was targeting blue -- targeting a San Antonio Police Department officer, no matter who it was. It was any officer he came across.\" \"This case, although we've made an arrest, is far from over,\" McManus said.\"We continue to investigate and until we have every shred of evidence that we believe exists, we'll then turn it over to the District Attorney for prosecution.\"McKane has a criminal history. In 2012 he pleaded no contest to an assault charge, according to a court database.Several police officers targeted over weekend The police shooting in San Antonio was one of four incidents in which law enforcement officers were shot Sunday. Marconi was the only fatality that day, but his death marked the 60th fatal shooting of an officer in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.Well-wishers formed a makeshift memorial with flowers, balloons and cards in honor of Marconi in front of San Antonio police headquarters. His family released a statement thanking the community for their support and prayers. \"He was well-respected,\" McManus said of the 20-year police veteran. \"He was a great guy, a great investigator. He was just a solid guy and I can't describe the loss to the police department and the community.\" CNN's Emanuella Grinberg and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Swimming, aerobics, racquet sports slash risk of death, study says","articleText":" (CNN)Doctors often recommend daily physical activity, but does exercise actually help us live longer? And are certain sports healthier than others? A new study suggests that exercise can slash your risk of death by 28%, and certain activities may be even more beneficial.Dr. Pekka Oja of the UKK Institute for Health Promotion Research in Finland was curious about the idea.  \"There is plenty of evidence showing that physical activity is good for our health,\" said Oja, lead author of the study published Tuesday in BMJ. \"But (the World Health Organization) recommends generic physical activity, without specifics. We were interested in how sports could contribute to health and how different sport disciplines could benefit health.\"Oja and his colleagues wanted to expand upon existing research about the benefits of physical activity. Some studies have tested the effects of exercise intensity, suggesting that vigorous exercise, like running, has greater health benefits than passive exercise, such as walking to work. Other studies looked at the short-term effects of exercise on health -- for example, how a six-week exercise program improved participants' well-being -- but they didn't show the long-term effects, Oja said. What the researchers wanted to know was whether exercise really wards off death, either from cardiovascular disease or from other causes. They were also curious whether different sports keep us alive longer than others. Physically active vs. physically inactiveOja and his team gathered health data from over 80,000 individuals from Scotland and England for the study, which spanned nine years, from 1994 to 2003. Of the participants, a little more than half were female, with an average starting age of 52 for both groups. At the start of the study, the participants took a survey assessing their physical activity habits, medical history and lifestyle (including education level, smoking and drinking frequency, and daily stress). About 45% met the physical activity guidelines set by the WHO, which include 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity a week for adults ages 18 to 65.

{"_id":"Syfy's 'Incorporated' imagines future ravaged by climate change","articleText":" (CNN)Politics is often too cavalierly connected to entertainment choices, but a show about a dystopian future ravaged by climate change -- produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon -- probably invites more scrutiny on that score than most.\"Incorporated,\" a Syfy series, will thus find tolerance for the concept somewhat linked to the audience's built-in belief system, before this pretty subversive drama gets into the meat of a story that weds espionage-like intrigue with a tragic boy-meets-girl back story.Set in 2074, the show's conceit is that the world has been taken over by multinational corporations, amid a climate crisis that has starkly separated the haves from have-nots and brought governments to their knees. The best moments, in fact, are essentially small ones that chronicle this unsettling turn of events, such as a Chinese TV commercial soliciting donations to help that starving Third World country populated by climate refugees, the United States.Still, \"Incorporated\" -- created by brothers Alex and David Pastor (\"Self/less\") -- can only afford a modest amount of world-building on its TV budget. So the narrative zeroes in on Ben Larson (\"Reign's\" Sean Teale), a rising young executive who is determined to reach the 40th floor, corporate-speak within his company for getting ahead.Ben is married to Laura (Allison Miller), but it turns out his real motivation is to be reunited with the love of his life, Elena (Denyse Tontz). Both had been relegated to the wasteland known as the Red Zone, where Elena's brother (Eddie Ramos) still resides, and which Elena only escaped by becoming a kind of glorified escort/sex slave for the super-rich.These details come out in flashbacks, while the present action centers on Ben's labors to unlock secrets about Elena's whereabouts without alerting those above him, which include top brass played by Dennis Haysbert and Julia Ormond. And while those who climb the corporate ladder are fabulously rewarded, the punishment for those who fail or transgress is equally ruthless.The situations are reasonably tense as \"Incorporated\" winds through its first handful of episodes. But the Orwellian nightmare that the writers concoct winds up taking a back seat to a more conventional cat-and-mouse game as Ben navigates his way through the ranks. Similarly, the show's futuristic vision is largely visualized by better versions of portable devices and wardrobe.What starts out as an ambitious concept thus feels less and less so as the plot progresses. And while Syfy deserves credit for undertaking something that certainly sounds provocative on paper, creatively speaking, \"Incorporated\" doesn't ascend to the TV equivalent of the 40th floor.\"Incorporated\" premieres November 30 at 10 p.m. on Syfy.","articleCategory":["entertainment"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/entertainment/incorporated-review/index.html"}
{"_id":"Syria war: 16,000 displaced from devastated eastern Aleppo, UN says","articleText":" (CNN)Up to 16,000 people have fled the violence in Syria's war-ravaged eastern Aleppo, with food stocks \"practically finished\" and every hospital bombed beyond use, the UN's humanitarian chief said Tuesday.  But nearly 200,000 people are believed to be still in eastern Aleppo, as the Syrian regime pounds it with airstrikes and troops storm through it in an operation to retake the enclave after more than four years of rebel control.\"I am extremely concerned about the fate of civilians as a result of the deeply alarming and chilling situation unfolding in Aleppo city,\" UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien said in a statement.\"Initial reports indicate that up to 16,000 people have been displaced, many into uncertain and precarious situations. It is likely that thousands more will have no choice but to flee should fighting continue to spread and intensify over the coming days.\"Government forces and armed paramilitary groups loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began a renewed push toward eastern Aleppo on November 15, as regime warplanes continued to pound the area to flush out rebels and civilians. They have made rapid territorial gains since entering eastern Aleppo on the ground Saturday, taking a huge portion of the northeast. Russian media on Monday cited its defense ministry, saying 40% of the east was now in regime hands, however CNN sources put the figure at just over 20%. Their gains drive a wedge through the zone and splits it into two sections.\"There are no modes of transportation and no vehicles in the streets, so civilians are fleeing and walking close to 8 or 9 kilometers on foot, carrying what they can and their children, and fleeing towards the western parts of Aleppo,\" an activist told CNN.Rescuers debilitatedHospitals have been obliterated in months of bombing and by the start of this week there wasn't a single one in operation, O'Brien and medical organizations have said.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered mobile field hospitals be sent to Aleppo to provide immediate medical assistance to residents, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-run Sputnik news network on Tuesday.Russia has been the Syrian regime's closest and most powerful ally, and its support has been widely blamed for the destruction of hospitals and schools across the country in aerial bombardments.Russia will send a multipurpose hospital to serve 100 patients, which includes a children's ward, as well as a mobile field hospital for 50 patients, which can also provide ambulatory treatment for some 200 people per day, Peskov said. More than 500 people were killed between Saturday and Monday in the latest assaults, the self-styled Syria Civil Defense, a volunteer rescue group also known as the White Helmets, told CNN. An additional 25 were killed overnight as the regime dropped parachute bombs in the Bab al-Nayreb neighborhood, an activist from the Aleppo Media Center said, adding dozens more had been injured.Residents in several other areas under heavy bombardment Tuesday told CNN that the ambulances and rescuers that usually come after the strikes were nowhere to be seen.\"Unfortunately, we can't do our duty due to the lack of fuel,\" White Helmets member Bebars Meshaal told CNN. Among those affected in the days of strikes is 7-year-old Bana Alabed, who has captured international attention with her tweets about daily life in eastern Aleppo. On Tuesday she shared a picture of her damaged home, posting that she felt \"sad but happy to be alive,\" following a flurry of tweets in recent days recording heavy bombardment on her house.Before the evacuations in recent days, UNICEF said there were around 100,000 children in eastern Aleppo.'Restore basic humanity'Eastern Aleppo has become the epicenter of Syria's civil war, much of it decimated in regime strikes backed by Russian air power. Assad has vowed to take the whole of Aleppo, which has for years been divided between the largely regime-held west and rebel-held east. The government has besieged the east a number of times, cutting off both the rebels and civilians from the outside world, leaving communities on the brink of starvation -- without sufficient food, clean water, fuel and medical supplies. The last UN rations in Aleppo were distributed on November 13, and UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland warned last week that people in the area were on the brink of starvation.\"I ask all parties to the conflict to restore basic humanity in Syria,\" the UN's O'Brien said, calling for an end to the siege and for the safe passage of aid deliveries into the area. Beginning of the end?Taking all of Aleppo would mark a turning point in the Syrian war -- the city is the last urban rebel stronghold in the country. Seizing it would put the regime back in control of all four major cities.Some observers have suggested it would be the beginning of the end of the uprising that began in 2011.A solution to the war, which has drawn in both Russia and the US, has evaded the international community for years. Russia has used its veto power in the UN Security Council several times to shoot down proposed resolutions on the conflict. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called on the Security Council to immediately meet and examine the situation.\"More than ever, there is an urgent need for a cessation of hostilities and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance,\" Ayrault said in a statement, adding he would meet with the head of Aleppo's district councils, Brita Hagi Hasan, on Wednesday in Paris.O'Brien also called for a political solution, saying that \"the people of Syria have suffered far too much and for far too long.\" \"More than anything, I hope a path towards a political solution can be found soon so that we can give some semblance of hope to the many millions of Syrian families who tonight are hungry, sick, and fearing for their lives,\" he said.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/middleeast/aleppo-syria-humanitarian-displacement/index.html"}
{"_id":"Syria war: Russia, China vote against Aleppo ceasefire","articleText":"Aleppo, Syria (CNN)Russia and China on Monday vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Syrian city of Aleppo to allow desperately needed aid into the war-ravaged zone.The United States and Russia verbally dueled before the vote, which called for a seven-day truce. Venezuela also rejected the resolution.The vote came as the Syrian regime continues to blitz Aleppo's east in support of its troops there, as part of an operation to seize control of the area held by rebels for more than four years.Dozens have been killed daily in the strikes and crossfire between regime forces and rebels since forces entered the area on November 26, activist groups say.While the regime has made sweeping territorial gains in eastern Aleppo, rebel forces fought back Monday in the al-Mayassar neighborhood. Rebels also hit a Russian mobile hospital in Aleppo, killing two female medics and injuring another pediatrician, Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement.A government siege on eastern Aleppo is tighter than ever, and food stocks, clean water supplies and medicine are running dry. The United Nations has repeatedly called for safe passage for its humanitarian staff, but it said the Syrian government and its most powerful ally, Russia, have failed to guarantee that.Russia has begun sending in aid and setting up mobile clinics, after hospitals in eastern Aleppo were bombed beyond use. Russia has been widely blamed for the destruction of medical facilities. It has supported Syrian government troops with an aerial bombardment campaign.Disagreement in the Security CouncilIt was the sixth Russian veto since 2011 on a Syria-themed resolution. China joined for the fifth time.Years of disagreement among major powers on Syria spilled over in the Security Council before and after the veto.Russia claimed there was progress being made in talks between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry and that calling for a vote was a bad tactic.  But the deputy US ambassador, Michele Sison, responded, \"That is a made up alibi.\"Sison told the council the United States and others backing the resolution were not going to let Russia \"string along\" the Security Council while waiting for a compromise from the Russians that never seems to come.The draft resolution demanded that all parties in the conflict allow immediate and safe humanitarian access to all of Aleppo for the United Nations and its partners.It did not include groups the council categorizes as terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and the Al-Nusra Front.The United States and Russia announced Saturday they were working together on an agreement to have all rebel groups expelled from eastern Aleppo and to ensure safe delivery of aid there by humanitarian staff. The United States had armed groups there it considered moderate, while Russia targeted the same groups with airstrikes to prop up the Assad regime. Lavrov, speaking at a news conference in Moscow before the vote, argued that a ceasefire would also give rebels the chance to regroup and strengthen. He said Moscow and Washington planned talks on the routes and timing of the withdrawal of rebels. \"Once they're set, a ceasefire regime will come into force to start the evacuation of these armed groups. If US-Russian cooperation on this will bring results -- and we have all reasons to believe it will do so -- then the problem of eastern Aleppo will be effectively solved,\" he said, adding it would allow \"smooth humanitarian aid delivery\" and normalize life there. The 15-member Security Council has faced widespread criticism over its failure to find a political solution to the Syrian war, which has left an estimated 400,000 people dead. Even agreeing on terms to allow an occasional aid delivery often takes weeks or months. Regime takes 60% of eastern AleppoThirty-two civilians were killed and 115 injured Monday in Aleppo, while 67 people were killed and 80 injured on Sunday in airstrikes that targeted residential areas, marketplaces and schools, according to the self-styled Syrian Civil Defense rescue group, also known as the White Helmets. The regime now holds some 60% of eastern Aleppo, making swift gains since breaking through rebel defense lines.Hundreds have died since regime forces entered eastern Aleppo, according to activist groups, while around 30,000 civilians have now fled, some of them reviling the rebels who they say wouldn't let them leave, and others condemning the regime for the decimation of their homes and the high human toll from the airstrikes.'We will rebuild'Regime forces captured the entire northeast in the first few days, including its largest district, Masaken Hanano, where civilians are starting to return. Khaled Chobello is one of those residents, coming back for the first time since he fled in 2012, when rebels took over eastern Aleppo.Masaken Hanano has been largely reduced to rubble, and Chobello's apartment is now a chaotic mess, with holes through the walls and his possessions thrown into a heap. \"I'm very sad because everything is either destroyed or ransacked,\" he said. One of the few possessions of value found under the rubble was a photograph of his family.\"The walls are destroyed, but we will come back here and rebuild.\"CNN's Alla Eshchenko, Basma Atassi, Eyad Kourdi and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.

The short video -- a take on the Mannequin Challenge -- was created by the Revolutionary Forces of Syria (RFS), an opposition media group, to draw attention to the crisis amid a renewed aerial assault on the besieged city.More than 300 people have been killed in Aleppo's rebel-held eastern districts since the Syrian regime resumed heavy bombardment last Tuesday following a three-week lull.An RFS spokesperson told CNN the group wanted to use the hashtag to \"reach the western audience\" and \"show them part of the Syrian suffering.\" 'Error of judgment'The nearly one-minute long video has been the subject of criticism on social media. On Wednesday the Syrian Civil Defense released a statement calling it an \"error of judgment\". \"This video and the related posts were recorded by RFS media with Syria Civil Defense volunteers, who hoped to create a connection between the horror of Syria and the outside world using the viral 'Mannequin challenge.' This was an error of judgment, and we apologize on behalf of the volunteers involved,\" the statement read. The Syrian Civil Defense was recently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for its work rescuing thousands of people since the Syrian conflict began over five years ago.RFS also issued a statement of clarification on Wednesday in relation to the footage, saying that the video was used by the regime to \"distort facts and twist perceptions.\"Meanwhile, Russian media, such as RT, said the footage raised doubts about the White Helmets' other rescue videos.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has previously claimed that the video of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, who was pulled from the rubble after an airstrike in August, was faked. In an interview with the Swiss SRF 1 TV channel, President Assad alleged that the viral photograph was \"forged\" by the rescue group.Internet trendsIt is not the first time that activists in Syria have used a viral sensation to elevate their message. During the summer, RFS released a series of images showing Syrian children holding pictures of Pokemon characters with the words: \"Save me, I am in Syria.\"Syrian media activist group SMO Syria posted a video in August 2014 with its own take on the Ice Bucket Challenge, a global campaign aimed at raising awareness about the disease ALS. In the video, a young man challenges celebrities in the Arab world to experience their suffering before pouring a bucket of sand over his head.

Whether it is people finding a way to pay the bills, caring for an aging parent, helping a friend get sober, surviving a divorce, or coping with cancer ... the list goes on and on of the immediate and daily concerns we often confront, leaving little room in our heads and our hearts for the plight of people a world away.We've been able to compartmentalize the plight of the Syrian people for years. And especially in an election year, where making American lives better was every candidate's focus, it became even easier. Whatever cursory attention Syria got during this presidential election was meant to signal to each side's base what degree of hostility we should have toward refugees who might be terrorists.But the election is over. It's time to acknowledge what we have comfortably ignored as a nation for too long. The implications of allowing Syria to spiral into further disarray are monumental. Politically, we're allowing Russia and Iran to prop up a butcher. Our allies in the region are under immense economic stress from swelling refugee populations. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other terror groups are exploiting a chaotic vacuum to their advantage. This problem isn't going away. Now Donald Trump inherits what President Barack Obama failed to solve. Yes, it's complicated. But that's no excuse not to try.In fact, there are 8.5 million reasons to. That's how many children are in need of immediate aid. For the more than 400,000 dead Syrians, 50,000 of whom were children, we are too late. That's because the Syrian regime, backed by Russian muscle, has been bombing nurseries, hospitals, schools and other civilian targets for years, in some cases using horrific chemical weapons and cluster bombs to maximum effect. The photos of Syria's children -- most notably of one who died and washed up on the shores of Turkey trying to escape, and another of a boy named Omran, sitting shell-shocked in the back of an ambulance -- are heartbreaking reminders of the ongoing genocide that's happening before our eyes, in plain view.With this reality in mind, we must persuade the Trump administration and Congress to debate political, diplomatic and, yes, military solutions to try to staunch these atrocities. But first, before any of that, we must as a nation show them we care.Trump has made clear during the course of the election that he would not take in any Syrian refugees. While that's not the position I wish he would take, I can live with this, because keeping refugees out matters to him, and presumably his many supporters. And ultimately, the humane and practical solution is to secure a safe zone within Syria so that other countries, including ours, do not have a refugee crisis in the first place. Indeed, one of the most straightforward things we can do -- and the most significant -- is to give Syrians a safe way to return home. It's also something Trump and a Republican-led Congress could agree on.To this end, I've partnered with an awareness campaign called #HelpMeGoHome, with the sole purpose of pressuring political leaders to advocate for safe zones. We have to start somewhere -- this is a pretty good place.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/opinions/syria-should-be-priority-cupp/index.html"}

So in two weeks we've had two different seasons.\" For most people in Europe the weather is simply small talk. For Raed Jazbeh  the seasons are a cause of genuine bemusement. The weather in Germany, after all, is a far cry from the distinct seasons in his native Syria.Jazbeh is the founder of the Syrian Expat Philharmonic Orchestra -- a musical ensemble composed entirely of Syrians, many of whom are refugees who have fled the country's bloody war.With a 170-year-old double bass that's been loaned to him by his side, Jazbeh is on his way to a final rehearsal for a concert taking place later that night when CNN meets him.The performance in Berlin will be by the Damascus String Quintet, a breakaway group that represents the orchestra on occasion. Coming to BerlinRaed came to Germany in 2013 on an orchestral tour from Damascus; he claimed asylum in the European country and hasn't been back to Syria since. \"My friends told me, 'You have to start a new life here. You cannot do anything in the war'.\"He is one of the 366,000 Syrians who had made Germany their home by 2015, according to that country's Central Register of Foreigners.But while Damascus is where he came to Germany from, Jazbeh's hometown is Aleppo: a city currently under siege as Syria's 5-year civil war rages on. Raed, who has played with the Symphony Orchestra of the Damascus Higher Institute of Music and the Arab Philharmonic Orchestra, was born there to a creative family -- his father, brother, and sister are all musicians.Indeed, Aleppo, he says, is known as \"the music capital of the Middle East\", and was the birthplace of muwashshah, a classical genre with 800 years of history. \"I was quite lucky to be born in Aleppo. It's a very musical city. Everybody has at least one musician in the family -- whether it's an oud player or a singer.\"Getting set-upOnce in Germany, getting the orchestra off the ground wasn't easy.\"I started to contact my friends in Europe. It took me nine months to find them,\" Jazbeh tells CNN.\"Some people said it was a very big dream and impossible, that I couldn't do it. But I was patient and I had hope that I could do it.\"After fundraising, the group performed their first concert in 2015, with 30 Syrian musicians and 20 from Germany. This year, the orchestra has 65 Syrian musicians from all over Europe, although the group is based in Bremen where Jazbeh lives.\"I love it there,\" Raed says. \"Everybody's been very welcoming, there's no Pegida there either,\" he adds, referencing the far right, anti-Islamist group that has seen some popularity in other parts of the country.A cultural ministryFor Raed, the orchestra isn't a pet project -- he has grand ambitions for the group. \"We aren't here to play a game. We are here to play serious music,\" he says. \"We hope to continue and be an official orchestra in Europe.\"Among other things, the group performs works by Syrian composers, and features some traditional Syrian instruments.The orchestra also serves, in his eyes, as a cultural ministry. \"Most of the media every day have the news about the war and fighting in Syria. We need to do something different ...[to put forward] the beautiful face of Syria.\"It seems that audiences are rooting for the group.\"After every performance we have Syrians and Europeans come up to us. They tell us to continue ... we feel we have to continue. We have to do something. \"We cannot stop this war, so by our music we can do something. Maybe it's very small, but it's very important.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/20/asia/syrian-orchestra-ime/index.html"}

The message asked fighters to attend the game on Thursday at Hamdania Stadium, located in the western government-controlled part of the city, adding that rebels who planned to attend would be offered safe passage.The initiative is \"a gesture of goodwill on the path of national reconciliation, and any citizen is welcome to participate in the game,\" the message, in Arabic, read.It comes amid a heavy bombardment campaign by the Syrian government on eastern Aleppo which has killed scores of civilians and put most hospitals and schools out of service. Over 250,000 people have been trapped in eastern Aleppo since pro-government forces encircled the area in July.Related: Who still lives in this decimated city -- and why?Those interested in participating in the game should come \"via pre-organized routes\", the government's message read.\"Diplomacy of football\"It is unclear if opposition fighters are accepting the invitation.In a tweet, Fares Shehabi, a Syrian parliamentarian in Aleppo and a prominent businessman allied to the Syrian regime, said: \"Will the diplomacy of football succeed in ending the largest kidnapping operation of civilians [by rebels]?

The United Nations this week described the bombing of rebel-held areas by the regime as \"indiscriminate\".Aref al-Aref, a resident of eastern Aleppo, confirmed to CNN that text messages were sent out to some of his friends in the city.Hamdania is currently under the control of the government, but shells fired by rebels regularly hit the area.The stadium there is the largest in Aleppo and was once a venue for international football games.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/middleeast/syria-aleppo-football-match/index.html"}
{"_id":"Syrian uprising: With the end near, the past may inform the future ","articleText":" (CNN)Thousands of people are fleeing the eastern, rebel-controlled part of Aleppo. Pro-regime forces have breached the once stable front lines in this battered city. The end is near. It's the beginning of the end of the uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad that began March 15, 2011, in the opening phases of what once was optimistically called the Arab Spring. It is also, perhaps, the final death knell for that string of revolts or revolutions or uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, which have ended in catastrophe (with the possible exception of Tunisia). I reported from Aleppo in August 2012, when it appeared the Syrian uprising had a chance to succeed. Aleppo, Syria's largest city and its industrial powerhouse, had initially stayed out of the rebellion. But in the summer of 2012 it rose up against the regime, and when it joined the revolt it seemed, back then, only a matter of time before the regime would come tumbling down. In the already severely battered neighborhood of Salahadin, a masked rebel fighter told me he was confident victory was near.  \"We will win, because we have iman -- faith -- we have faith,\" he told me. \"We believe in God. They, the regime, don't believe in God.\" But in the time I spent in Aleppo, there were also hints already that the opposition was divided, and already some of the factions showed signs of extremism. I recall sitting on the curb in front of a police station in the rebel-controlled neighborhood of Sukkari when we heard a gunshot. The rebels inside, who were part of the Tawhid faction, had just executed someone accused of being a spy. Moments later a young man was brought outside, blindfolded, his hands tied behind his back, led by two masked gunmen. His friend, who was sitting next to me on the curb, explained the young man, 16 years old, had been arrested and interrogated because rebel fighters had found the phone numbers of girls on his mobile phone. The faction, which now controlled his neighborhood, was taking him home to his parents, who would be forced to pay a $75 fine.Later that afternoon, we watched as a man and woman, her face hidden by a veil, left the neighborhood pushing a baby carriage full of bundles.I asked the woman where they were going.\"We're leaving. These people are no better than the regime. In fact, they're worse,\" she shot back, without stopping. Five years later, and the tide has decisively turned.  Russia came to Assad's rescue in September 2015. With massive Russian air support, and help from Iran and Hezbollah, the rebels are losing ground everywhere. The opposition, always a hodgepodge of often mutually hostile groups united only by their enmity of the regime, hold only scattered and shrinking pockets of territory around Damascus, Homs, Daraa and Aleppo, with the only sizable area still under their control in Idlib province. Turkey supports factions of the Free Syrian Army along Syria's northern border, and the United States backs the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast, but both those groups are focused on fighting ISIS, not the regime. The Obama administration, which drew red lines in Syria, which demanded the ouster of Assad, which called for democracy and human rights in Syria, in the end could do little to change the course of events. The fight against ISIS took precedence over all else. What will President Trump do in the Middle East?In those areas where the government re-establishes control, the future for former opponents is bleak. The dreaded Mukhabarat, or secret police, is almost certain to hunt down and punish those who took up arms against Assad. Middle Eastern dictators are not known for their magnanimity, and Syria is no exception. If you want to know how Assad is likely to deal with his defeated opponents, just look at the case of the February 1982 Hama uprising.  That year, members of the Muslim Brotherhood tried to seize the central Syrian city from the regime of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father. Regime forces, led by Bashar's uncle, Rifaat, surrounded Hama and pummeled it for weeks with tank and artillery fire, killing at least 10,000. Afterward, they went in, slaughtering thousands more, rebels and civilians alike. Aleppo family says goodbye on TwitterI visited Hama repeatedly in the early 1990s: It was an eerie place crawling with informers where, unlike elsewhere in Syria, people were hesitant to speak with outsiders. The regime had bulldozed the old city to the ground, and built atop it a fancy hotel and parks. When eastern Aleppo falls, it's only a matter of time before the remaining pockets of resistance will fall, either by fire or capitulation.  And the end of the uprising will have arrived.

She's the yoga coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Lightning and others in Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional Golfers' Association. (CNN)Despite the myriad joys the season brings, it can be a stressful time for many of us. Between shopping, cooking, travel, parties, house guests, winter storms and shorter days, the holidays pile on the stress with little regard for the continued demands of our everyday lives. Instead of feeling festive, we're often left tense, irritable and exhausted.The good news is that we're all equipped with a natural superpower to manage stress: breathing.By training ourselves to breathe properly and leverage the power of our respiration, we can reverse the negative physiological responses that dampen our holiday spirit. Better breathing also reduces physical tension, promotes mindfulness, and helps us rest -- all useful in decreasing the impact of holiday stress.That said, like any superpower, if not fully understood and properly controlled, your breathing can be used against you. Because breathing is largely an autonomic activity, too many people believe they never have to think about it. However, if your posture is poor or you consistently feel stressed, chances are you've fallen into the habit of breathing high in your chest rather than fully in your lungs. This isn't a pattern you should leave on autopilot. Left unchecked, \"bad\" breathing facilitates your stress response. When you feel tense and anxious, the sympathetic fight-or-flight aspect of your nervous system turns on, quickening your breathing and increasing your heart rate, blood pressure and stress hormone production. Uncontrolled, rapid, chest-oriented respiration feeds your fight-or-flight response and can actually initiate your sympathetic nervous system -- even if no other stress factors are present -- locking you in a state of breathing-induced stress.Thankfully, you can use your superpower for good in the battle against stress by practicing diaphragmatic breathing that taps your parasympathetic \"rest and restore\" nervous system. In as little as 90 seconds of functional deep breathing, you can elicit a relaxation response that lowers blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormone levels. Ready to put your super power into action? Below, I've outlined four simple methods for dealing with stress during the holidays that also work year round. These are the same techniques I teach my professional athlete clients to help them deal with the ongoing stress of their careers. So, by following these instructions, you'll not only use your breathing like a superpower, you'll do it like a pro.1. Turn sighs of frustration into exhales of reliefFrom lack of parking spaces and long shopping lines to rude relatives and travel delays, the holidays often bring up feelings of exasperation and frustration. Instead of letting those feelings bubble to the boiling point, when you find yourself sighing in frustration, take the cue from your autonomic nervous system to turn those sighs into exhales of relief. It's a simple way to tap your parasympathetic nervous system and avoid boiling over. Here's how: Spend at least 90 seconds taking long, deep breaths that emphasize your exhalations. Inhale through your nose and exhale -- like a big, elongated sigh of relief -- out of your mouth. Ideally, inhale for a five count and exhale for at least a seven count. 2. Breathe away tensionMost of the tension and fatigue we experience in our neck, shoulders and back comes from the shallow, chest-oriented breathing that accompanies stress and poor posture. That's because stress-induced breathing reduces the function of our primary respiration muscle, our diaphragm, requiring upper-body muscles to do double-duty as overworked, compensatory accessory breathing muscles. The increased physical stress of poor breathing reinforces poor posture, leading to chronic pain, lack of mobility and even migraines. Because we take as many as 24,000 per day, stretching out upper-body tension will only provide temporary relief; we need to restore diaphragm function and ribcage position. Using proper breathing biomechanics will not only relieve tension, but also work to prevent it.Here's how:From seated or lying on your back, place your hands on the lower part of your ribs. Use inhalations to fill your lungs, externally rotating your lower ribs and expanding them out, so that your hands move away from each other. Avoid tensing and raising your shoulders. On exhalations, completely empty your lungs, using core muscles, like an abdominal crunch, to move your lower ribs in, back and down toward your waist. As you exhale, your hands should move toward each other. Pause slightly after exhalation with your ribcage in this position, enabling your diaphragm to fully dome in preparation for your next inhalation. Once your diaphragm begins working as your primary respiratory muscle again, your neck, shoulders and upper back should relax. For more detailed instructions and techniques, check out my article, \"Breathe better to move better.\"3. Connect to breathing, disconnect from anxietyHow will I get it all done? What if they don't like my gifts? Any stress caused by anxiety takes us out of the present moment. Whether you're worrying about how to maneuver the social scene at the office Christmas party or concerned about the new year ahead, you're disconnecting yourself from the here and now. Breathing is your most profound connection to the present, since it's always happening. By turning your awareness to your breathing for just a few minutes, you can cultivate a sense of mindfulness that counters your anxiety.Here's how:Practicing a breath-awareness, mindfulness meditation doesn't require any special circumstances. You can do it anywhere simply by tuning into your breathing. You don't need to be in a quiet space or special posture or even to close your eyes. Simply concentrate on the sensations of your breath. Slightly lengthen and deepen your inhalations and exhalations while you follow the path of your breath in through your nose, down into your lungs and back out. Notice the expansion and contraction of your ribcage and any related sensations you can perceive. If thoughts come into your mind, push them aside and maintain your focus on your breathing as it happens, in the moment. 4. Use respiration to rest moreRest is more essential than ever when we're under stress, but the ability to sleep well can elude us during the holidays, especially when our schedules are packed with parties, travel and house guests. There's a reason your parasympathetic nervous system is also called the \"rest and restore\" system. Its primary role is to enable restoration of all the systems in your body. In addition to facilitating the restorative aspects of your autonomic system, diaphragmatic breathing can help you fall asleep easier. It's a little-known fact that carbon dioxide acts as a natural sedative for the brain, so you can use specific breathing methods to leverage its production at bedtime.Here's how:Exhaling slowly and maintaining a long pause after exhalation slows the release of carbon dioxide levels to provide a tranquilizing effect. My \"peace\" pause breathing is a favorite sleep-inducing breathing technique for my MLB clients, who often have difficulty sleeping because of the intense travel and late-night schedules associated with playing 162 games over 180 days per season. While in bed, lengthen and deepen your inhalations to a five count and your exhalations to a slow-paced seven count. After each exhalation, pause -- without taking in anymore air -- and spell out P-E-A-C-E in your mind before your next inhalation. Repeat until you fall asleep.

When he saw it, \"I lost it,\" he said.\"It's the most devastating thing that has ever happened to me in my life.\"Five days after Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the circumstances of his death continue to spark debate and outrage around the country.

Minutes later, he was shot by Officer Betty Shelby, who had stopped when she saw the abandoned SUV in the middle of the roadway. Through her attorney Shelby said Crutcher was behaving strangely and ignoring her commands, and she was afraid that he might be reaching for a weapon.Now Crutcher's family is speaking out to CNN about the tragedy.'My compassionate son'In the moments before his death, a police officer in the helicopter circling overhead can be heard referring to Crutcher as a \"bad dude.\" That description haunts his mother, Leanna.\"He was my compassionate son,\" she said in an interview with CNN on Facebook Live. \"No one could ever do anything that would turn him away from being their friend.

John Kasich.Along with Suprun, 36 other electors planning to vote for Trump would have to abandon their vote for him -- which is almost beyond the realm of possibility. Even if Suprun doesn't cast his vote for Trump, Trump is headed toward the 270 votes he needs to become president in January. In the editorial Suprun explained that he believes Trump has shown he's not qualified for the Oval Office. He wrote that the last time the nation was united was after the Sept. 11 attacks, while Trump has failed \"to unite America\" and drove \"a wedge between us.\"\"He does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage,\" Suprun wrote in the editorial.Joe Biden leaves the door open for a 2020 runSuprun added that Trump's actions, such as saying \"Russia should hack Hillary Clinton's emails\" and urging \"violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign\" show that he is not qualified to be president.He also wrote about how the advisers Trump surrounds himself with, including retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn for National Security Adviser and Steve Bannon, a former Breitbart executive named to a senior adviser position, are not positive influences on him.\"He has surrounded himself with advisers such as Stephen K.

{"_id":"Texas will require aborted fetuses to be buried or cremated","articleText":" (CNN)The Governor says they are \"giving voice to the unborn.\" Critics say they are a naked attempt to shame and financially burden Texas women seeking abortions. They are controversial new rules in Texas which will require abortion clinics to bury or cremate fetal remains.  They follow a landmark US Supreme Court defeat for abortion opponents this summer. After the high court struck down a Texas law restricting abortions, state health officials quickly got to work proposing the new rules, which they claim will help stop the spread of communicable disease. More than a dozen states have similar rules or laws for fetal remains. After a few months of fairly evenly-split debate consisting of tens of thousands of comments (31 groups were in favor of the rules, while 26 opposed them), the Texas Department of State Health Services rules are slated to take effect later this month.

Hellerstedt, which threw out Texas' so-called \"clinic shutdown\" law, Gov. Greg Abbott lauded the rules. In a fundraising email, published by The Texas Tribune, he made it clear the initiative was aimed more at \"giving voice to the unborn\" than it was at public safety.\"Human life is not a commodity or an inconvenience. It is our most basic right. Without it, we have no other rights,\" the email said. \"I believe it is imperative to establish higher standards that reflect our respect for the sanctity of life. This is why Texas will require clinics or hospitals to bury or cremate human or fetal remains.\"But pro-choice advocates questioned the timing of the governor's letter, noting that Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the 5-3 Whole Women's Health ruling days earlier that the Texas law in question cured \"no significant health-related problem.\" The SCOTUS rulingThat law required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and and it mandated that abortion clinics have facilities on par with an ambulatory surgical center. \"We agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so,\" Breyer wrote for the majority. Proponents of legal abortion say the Department of State Health Services rules, which go into effect December 9, are no different than the law shot down by the high court. The Center for Reproductive Rights issued a statement calling the new rules unconstitutional and in \"direct defiance of the high court's ruling\" in the Whole Women's Health case. \"These new restrictions reveal the callous indifference that Texas politicians have toward women,\" said David Brown, the center's senior staff attorney. \"Forcing a woman to pay for a burial after she ends a pregnancy or experiences a miscarriage is not just absurd -- it is an unnecessary burden and an intrusion on her personal beliefs.\"The costsAccording to estimates provided by critics of the rule, the price of cremation or burial could cost, on average, $2,000 per procedure. The Texas Medical Association and Texas Hospitals Association, both of which oppose the rules, said cremation could cost between $1,500 and $4,000. Planned Parenthood says the cost of an abortion ranges from $300 to $950, depending on the type of procedure required. In responding to those estimates, the state said that it had received cost data from numerous groups and determined that the cost was a fraction of the opponents' estimate. It said the cost would be $450 annually per facility. \"This cost would be offset by the elimination of the current method of disposition,\" the state said. Marilyn Robertson, board president of Jane's Due Process, which provides legal representation for pregnant girls in Texas, called this assertion \"fundamentally incorrect\" in testimony presented to the state. \"Undoubtedly, if these rules are implemented, the clinics are forced to pass along the costs of this unnecessary regulation, which is not insignificant,\" she said. The rules will disproportionately affect black and brown women who already have trouble shouldering the costs of medical procedures, Robertson wrote. She further said the rules were cruel, unnecessary and aimed solely at deterring women from exercising their constitutional rights. \"Texas healthcare providers like hospitals and abortion clinics already follow the state's standards for the sanitary disposal of medical waste including embryonic tissue,\" she said. \"An additional procedure with no recognized medical value only unnecessarily interferes with a woman's autonomy and her decision making in her own medical care.\"Supporters: It's about dignityWithin the letters and statements of support for the rules are few references to any health benefits. Most of the support, which largely emanates from religious and pro-life groups, cites the need to treat fetuses with dignity, rather than discarding them in a landfill. \"While the Supreme Court tragically does not allow states to ban most abortions, we believe that Texas law should be changed to assure that the bodies of the victims of abortion are not treated like medical waste. These proposed rules validate the dignity of those unborn babies whose lives are unfortunately lost to abortion,\" Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, said when the rules were proposed in July. Texas Right to Life, whose legislative director, John Seago, successfully urged the state to direct the rules solely at health care facilities, and not miscarriages and \"chemical abortions\" that occur in a woman's home, also employed the dignity defense. The group decried how opponents of the rules compared \"preborn children to amputated limbs and ovarian cysts, calling preborn children 'products of our bodies' and 'waste.'\"\"As usual, abortion advocates claimed that 'access to abortion is a fundamental liberty,' failing to mention that The Declaration of Independence actually lists 'Life' first,\" its statement said. According to Texas Right to Life, the fetal-burial rules may be elevated in stature next year. Sen. Don Huffines, a Dallas Republican, has said he would file legislation to codify the rules when the Legislature convenes in January. According to the Legislature's website, House Bill 201 -- \"relating to disposition of fetal remains by a health care facility\" -- was filed last month, and the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops has already issued its support for the bill.

{"_id":"Thanksgiving Eve: Your guide to meeting up before eating up","articleText":" (CNN)For many people, the holiday season -- Festivus! -- begins on Thanksgiving Eve. New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day immediately come to mind as bar nights. But the night before Turkey Day, informally known as \"Friendsgiving\" and \"Drinksgiving,\" may, anecdotally speaking, see more pub patrons.With nearly everyone taking off the next day, Thanksgiving Eve is basically Friday night times three. Friends arriving from distant places will converge on the local watering hole, while local singles throng the same bar in the hopes of meeting someone before the holidays officially lift off. Hello, stranger! Your unofficial high school reunion or pre-turkey rager isn't necessarily something to be embarrassed about.Nothing in print (or on screen) is likely to stop you from texting friends to arrange a pre-Turkey hang session, so take pleasure in the fact that your natural social instinct is a healthy one. Be grateful for friendshipsRecent research has repeatedly shown that strong friendships and social ties extend our lives, generally keep us healthier and keep our brains active and synapses firing. \"People who are more socially connected live longer than people who are less socially connected,\" said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University. Whether your social network is measured in terms of the size or the extent to which you feel supported by it, people who have a wealth of friends live longer than those more socially impoverished, she adds.This is more or less the consensus within the social sciences. \"Social relationships can vastly promote health -- and the lack thereof would be vastly detrimental to health,\" said Yang Claire Yang, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"It's tremendous.\" Yang adds that the positive impact of social relationships can be assessed by \"objectively measured\" physiological markers across our cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems. In fact, the amount our social relationships influence our mortality and health are comparable to -- if not exceeding, Yang says -- well-known factors such as physical activity and smoking.The ways social connectedness influences health are practical and even logical, Holt-Lunstad explains.\"It's not just this weird correlation,\" she said. \"Just the extent you have others around and can provide assistance and resources and a sense of companionship. ... Even basic things like if you were to fall or have a medical emergency can make a huge difference in your outcome.\" Another example: If all your friends are vegetarians who do yoga, this \"social norm\" will probably influence you to exercise and eat right, says Holt-Lunstad. Relationships also help you manage stress. Friends help buffer us from the world and help us \"talk out\" our problems. In other cases, our social links to, say, a religious group can provide much-needed aid or financial assistance in times of need.That said, Holt-Lunstad notes there's also a dark side. \"Humans are complex, social relations are complex, and it's just not simple,\" she said. Some relationships can be a source of stress, while others may be a combination of both positive and negative. The people we have mixed feelings about, even if we love them, can be associated with detrimental physiological effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure or increased anxiety, says Holt-Lunstad.But what about an annual gathering with friends home for the holidays: Is this just social junk food or a nutritious social meal?\"Seeing someone we don't get to see often might strengthen our bonds and feelings of connectedness,\" Holt-Lunstad said.Yang agrees, so long as the people we socialize with \"actually promote or provide the kind of support and connection that you need.\"\"Having any is better than having none,\" Yang said. \"And having more is always better.\"Of course, more social connection is one thing; more time spent in the bar is another. Beware 'Blackout Wednesday'Bartenders have their own name for Thanksgiving Eve: \"Blackout Wednesday.\" The annual gathering is a time when some people throw caution to the wind.  Thanksgiving dinner may be the ultimate hangover cure, but too much booze is never a good thing. In particular, binge drinking is terrible for your health. Defined as five or more drinks (within two hours) for a man and four or more drinks for a woman, binge drinking can lead to accidents, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.There's another danger, too: Late nights and early mornings between Thanksgiving Eve through New Year's include some of the most dangerous on the nation's highways and byways. Overall, in 2014, just shy of 10,000 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These fatalities accounted for nearly one-third of all traffic-related deaths in the United States that year. Meanwhile, drugs other than alcohol were involved in about 16% of the total car crashes.Thanksgiving weekend contributed more car crash deaths than the holiday periods surrounding New Year's, Christmas, Fourth of July and Memorial Day, according to the safety administration. Only Labor Day weekend topped Thanksgiving in car crash deaths last year.Although Friendsgiving can be a healthy way to start the holiday season, it's also an important time to know your limits -- even if that means staying home.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/health/thanksgiving-eve-social-health/index.html"}

{"_id":"The 'Melaniin Goddess': Meet the model whose skin tone made her a social media sensation","articleText":" (CNN)She calls herself the 'Melaniin Goddess,' but years before Khoudia Diop came to celebrate her strikingly dark skin, the 19-year-old model struggled with bullying over her complexion.Today, it's not only her proudest asset, it has made her an overnight social media sensation. After partnering with The Colored Girl on a recent campaign to promote diversity, images of Diop went viral online. The Colored Girl is a creative agency dedicated to celebrating beauty in women of color.As a full-time model who first made her mark in Paris before moving to New York, Diop's sudden online fame -- she went from 300 to 350,000 followers on Instagram in a matter of days -- is perhaps a hopeful sign for an industry often criticized for its lack of diversity.Only around a quarter of the women that strut the catwalks of the industry's largest events -- including New York Fashion Week -- are models of color, according to a diversity report by The Fashion Spot. Diop speaks to CNN Style about body shame and the racism she experienced as a child, and discusses how these issues have helped shaped her as a role model.CNN: Tell us about your childhood and growing up in Senegal. How does it inspire you today?Khoudia Diop: Even though my complexion is quite common in Senegal and many parts of Africa, I was teased for my dark skin. Being teased and losing my self value eventually ended up inspiring me to be a better version of myself. I learned to find things to love about myself, and to celebrate them. CNN: How did you overcome this childhood bullying? KD: At first I tried confronting them, but soon I learned to tune out the negativity, which made me more confident and taught me to love myself.Having support from family, friends -- and now fans -- definitely helps to affirm that I am worthy, loved and beautiful. I hope everyone can see that in themselves and feel this way.CNN: Tell us about your first encounter with your agency The Colored Girl. Why did you choose them and what makes them different to other agencies? KD: The co-founders, Victory and Tori, first contacted me via social media and asked me to participate in their new campaign \"Rebirth.\"I was familiar with their previous work, and their entire portfolio is dedicated to celebrating diversity.We share a joint goal: to inspire, empower, and uplift women of color worldwide, and I was excited when they asked me to be a part of something so positive. We began working very closely after the release of the campaign, and now, they manage me. I love working with them, what they represent, and being a part of their cause -- it made sense and felt right.CNN: Do you still face bullies in the fashion industry today? KD: There are still people who make comments occasionally, but they're in the minority. Most of the responses I get -- from all types of people, not just women, and not just women of color -- has been hugely positive. Read: Fashion's biggest issue? The challenges of being a black model  CNN: So many women, whatever their color or shape, struggle to feel comfortable in their own skin. What philosophy fuels your self confidence and beauty ideals?KD: Diversity is what makes life interesting. All women should feel confident in the skin they're in -- everyone is beautiful in their own unique way, and the key is to realize that and celebrate it. CNN: Do you feel the fashion industry currently lacks diversity? Why? KD: It's come a long way, but has a much longer way to go. The majority of the industry has not fully embraced the idea of diversity, and majority of the fashion world is run by people who adhere to certain restrictive beauty ideals.But the reality is, most of the world does not look a certain way. So more women of color need to be seen as beautiful, and chosen, booked, cast and shown in fashion shows. Read: The man who 'invented' the supermodelCNN: How has social media helped you spread a message of acceptance? KD: Social media is such a powerful tool because it puts power in our hands.We are able to show ourselves to the world and set our own beauty standards. As more people use platforms such as Instagram to share their unique beauty, they help change the way we perceive beauty. We get to see more diversity and that's how it should be -- I love that. CNN: Can you describe what beauty means to you? KD: Beauty is not what's outside, it's who you are. What's inside is your true essence, and beauty comes from within. It's pure energy.

{"_id":"The 'boys are better at math' mindset creates gender gap in sciences","articleText":" (CNN)A recent online story titled \"Calling All Moms: Stop Staying That!\" caught my eye for obvious reasons.I'm a mom of two and wanted to see if I was saying something to my daughters that I shouldn't be. In a post for the online platform Medium, Nicole Bryan, a vice president of product management for a technology firm, wrote that she started thinking about the messaging we give to our daughters about math after she volunteered to help with math enrichment at her daughter's school. She was surprised to learn only two of the eight kids in her daughter's fourth grade class identified as having a significant aptitude for math were girls.When she asked friends who were raised in India if the ratio there was pretty much even in advanced math classes, they said it was.While Bryan said in her family there was \"absolute insistence\" that she be as good at math as her brother, she remembers subtle messages suggesting otherwise, such as her mom deferring to her dad when it came to math, but not when it came to reading or writing. \"When I see only 25 percent of an advanced math class comprised of girls, I begin to question if things have really changed enough,\" she wrote.Are we parents, both mothers and fathers, doing enough to keep our girls in math? I've been thinking about this a lot lately, as a mother of two girls, ages 8 and 10, who are both good at math, but rarely name it as one of their favorite subjects.We know how important it is to get more girls interested in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- to not only provide them with innovative and well-paying career opportunities in a highly competitive world, but to also bring diversity to those fields.While women took home 57% of bachelor's degrees in all fields in 2013, women earned just 43% of the degrees in math and just 19% and 18% of the degrees in engineering and computer science respectively, according to the National Girls Collaborative Project.One big reason why more women aren't lining up to enter STEM fields and become engineers and scientists is math, said Jo Boaler, a professor of mathematics education at Stanford.\"I can't tell you how many women, undergraduates at Stanford and others I've spoken to, said to me, 'I was going to go into science, engineering, whatever, but I didn't because of math,'\" said Boaler during an interview.Part of the reason is the messaging that they get at school and home, said Boaler. \"Many parents believe you can either do math or you can't and they'll say to their kids, 'Oh, you've got the math gene.' Or they tell them they don't have it,\" she said.\"We know that when mothers tell their daughters 'I wasn't good at math in school,' their daughter's achievement goes down,\" she said.Bryan, who has two kids, a 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, believes that a lot of women don't realize the messages they are sending their daughters. After reading her post, one mom told her, \"Guilty as charged. I'm doing things differently with girl #2.\"Even if you don't actually understand your children's math homework, Bryan suggests you guide your kids to resources to help them. \"It's not that you can't say 'Hey, let's work through this together' ... and solve it as a team. Just never start with 'I'm no good at it.' That is a very different message than 'Hey, let's figure this out together.'\"But this \"widespread myth of the math person\" extends far beyond the home and into classrooms across the country, said Boaler.I'm sure many of you reading this story have either been told math was for you or it wasn't.If you are a woman and you struggled with math while growing up, you probably came across a teacher at some point who told you not to worry, that math wasn't for you and that English was your subject.\"I taught Stanford young women, and many other women as well, who said to me that they were on a math pathway until one teacher ... told them math wasn't for them and that just switched their whole career ideas,\" she said.The way we teach math puts off girls Messaging alone though won't change the gender gap in math. What's also needed is a fundamental change in the way we teach the subject, said Boaler, who co-founded the non-profit organization youcubed, which aims to inspire, educate and teach teachers how to teach math.\"Math is taught in such a dry, procedural, abstract way,\" said Boaler. \"Unfortunately though, that dry, procedural math particularly puts off girls and we know that girls, for whatever reason more than boys, want a connected subject. They want to see the connections not only between math and the world and life, but they want to see the connections within math as well. They want to see math as this connected, conceptual subject, which is the subject it really is. But it's not taught in that way and that is a big part of the problem.\"She gives a very straightforward example: A teacher asks students to figure out the area of an 8 x 3 rectangle. In that case, it's a calculation with one answer. But, if the teacher wanted to make the problem more conceptual and the exercise more inquiry-based, the teacher could ask students to figure out how many rectangles they can find with an area of 24. (Check out this new video from Boaler to get a sense of how teachers can move math beyond memorization.)\"Suddenly, the kids' eyes will light up because they're having to make choices,\" said Boaler, author of \"Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Students' Potential through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching.\" \"They're thinking about the dimensions and how the length and width relate to each other. They're coming up with a whole variety of different ways of thinking about it.\"Another big issue in the teaching of math is that the subject has been set up as one that values speed, said Boaler. Timed tests -- such as how many facts can you solve in three minutes -- lead to math anxiety in classrooms and a general sense that speed is what is most important.\"With the emphasis on speed, we turn away those slow, deep thinkers, many of whom are girls, and those are the kids we want to go to high levels in math,\" she said. \"We put them off math from an early age by presenting it as a sort of shallow speed-based subject.\"In one of the courses she teaches at Stanford, Boaler says she has many \"math traumatized students,\" many of whom are women. When asking them what caused them to be so traumatized about math, \"they will pinpoint the moment, usually between second or third grade, when they started doing timed tests and some of them will say I just wasn't a good memorizer and we know that good memorizers don't have more math potential.\"'We know what works'Last summer, Boaler and her colleagues convened a summer camp at Stanford. The goal was to test out the impact of new teaching methods and messages that anyone can learn math.Eighty-one kids from disadvantaged backgrounds came together for an 18-day summer camp. The incoming seventh graders were taught open, creative math lessons and were told there is no such thing as a math person and how everyone's brains can grow and change. Every one of the kids, no matter their achievement level, came in saying they were not a math person, said Boaler.After the 18 days, they improved their test scores by the equivalent of 1.6 years in schooling, she said.\"We know how to do it well. We know the extensive research evidence. We know what works, but it's not happening in schools and classrooms. That's why it's so important to get evidence out to teachers and to parents.\"At youcubed, Boaler and her colleagues provide resources and lessons to teachers, parents and students. One of their online classes focuses on how everyone's brain grows and changes, how believing in yourself actually changes the way your brain operates and how stereotypes about girls and math just aren't supported by the research.Boaler and her colleagues worked with middle school math teachers to study the effectiveness of that online class. Students in one of the classes saw the online course at youcubed, while students in the other class did not. Everything else -- the teaching and messaging -- was the same.At the end of the year, they analyzed the kids' test performances. The students who took the online course did significantly better in all aspects of the Common Core assessments, and they also scored higher grade point averages in math, science and English -- just from taking that online course.\"It just shows you again that when you change kids' beliefs, that changes everything.\"How do you think we can keep more girls in math?

{"_id":"The 'surprising' way food ads sway preschoolers' snacking habits","articleText":" (CNN)Snack commercials that kids see on television may be more persuasive than you might think.The food advertisements that children as young as preschool age view while watching their favorite shows can sway them to overeat even when they're not hungry, a new study suggests. The small study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, is the first of its kind to weigh the effect that food advertisements have on preschoolers' snacking habits, said Jennifer Emond, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.Until now, most studies have examined that effect among school-age or older children. Yet \"highly palatable, unhealthy foods are heavily advertised to kids as young as 2 -- primarily on TV,\" Emond said. \"Overall, our research suggests that exposure to food ads can prime eating behaviors in young children that tells children to respond to external signals instead of listening to their own internal signals of fullness and hunger,\" she said. \"That learned response may set children up for developing poor eating habits that contribute to obesity.\"Snacking habits hackedThe study involved 60 children, ages 2 to 5 years old, who were shown a 14-minute segment of \"Elmo's World\" from the show \"Sesame Street.\" Half of the children watched the segment embedded with a mix of food advertisements, while others watched the segment embedded with a mix of department store ads.Before viewing, all of the children were provided with snacks to eat and were surveyed on how hungry they felt.Then, while viewing the segment, the children were provided with two snacks: corn snacks and graham snacks. The same corn snacks provided were featured in the food advertisements shown to some of the children. The researchers found that the preschoolers who watched the segment embedded with food ads consumed more calories in snacks on average than those who watched the department store ads.Additionally, the children who watched the food ads ended up eating more of the advertised corn snack than the graham snack -- even if they had never eaten the corn snack before and, therefore, were not familiar with it.\"That was surprising because it demonstrated the powerful effect food advertising can have on priming potentially unhealthy eating behaviors at a young age,\" Emond said. Emond added that similar findings have been demonstrated among older children in separate studies. The researchers believe that this latest finding among preschoolers could be replicated in a larger sample size.\"Given the consistency in the findings across different studies and now among different age groups, we do think we are measuring a true effect,\" Emond said.Food ads on the brainWhy might food advertisements have this effect on preschoolers? More research is needed to find a clear answer. However, it might have something to do with a reward system in the brain called the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, according to a study published last month in the International Journal of Obesity.That study, which involved about 200 children ages 9 to 10 years old, showed that viewing certain food advertisements can activate that reward system in the brain, said Emond, who was a co-author of the study.The finding suggests that \"seeing food cues in advertisements unconsciously signals children to eat in order to feel that rewarding sensation,\" Emond said. \"Importantly, we also know from our previous research that some children may have a genetic predisposition to respond to food ads.\"About 40% of all food and beverage ads that children and teens see on television are for unhealthy snacks, according to a 2015 report by the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity (PDF).\"Parents should not shrug off food marketing. These ads really do influence children,\" said Marlene Schwartz, director for the center and a professor of human development and family studies at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\"If the ads were for healthy foods, that would be an asset to parents, but when the ads are for unhealthy foods, they make parents' job harder,\" she said.Marketing may help kids eat healthierIndeed, food ads can be successful in encouraging healthy snacking, too. It turns out that marketing healthy foods in the same way as unhealthy snacks can nearly triple the likelihood of a child munching on fruits and vegetables, according to a study published in the journal Pediatrics this year.\"There is no doubt that advertising affects children. But we should also recognize that everyone -- children, adolescents and adults -- are exposed to media of all sorts on a daily basis,\" said Andrew Hanks, assistant professor of human sciences at Ohio State University and lead author of that marketing study.\"The more parents know about the impacts of advertising on children, the more they can help their children prepare to process the messages in an appropriate manner,\" he said. \"If parents are going to make food readily available for their children, choose the lower-calorie snacks, such as cut-up apples or carrot sticks.\"Many children's television programs are now offered ad-free through various services, said David Just, a professor at Cornell University who was a co-author of the same marketing study as Hanks.\"We think it is very important for parents to understand the impact that advertising of any kind has on their children,\" he said. \"Also, it is important for parents to be aware of what their children are watching and the types of ads their kids are viewing. And not only to be aware but to talk to them about what they see.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/health/food-ads-kids-preschool/index.html"}

{"_id":"The 21 days of President-elect Trump","articleText":" (CNN)Three weeks have passed since President-elect Donald Trump delivered a gracious, sober and almost totally unexpected victory speech at his election night rally in New York City. For nearly 48 hours, Trump embraced the role of decorous winner and temperate future commander-in-chief. He was uncharacteristically solicitous during an early meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House. The weight of the job ahead seemed hung around his neck like a steel collar. But then, with the third day on the horizon -- and street demonstrators on the march -- Trump cracked, tweeting falsely that \"professional protesters\" had been \"incited by the media.\" It was all, he wrote, \"Very unfair!\" And with that, life as we had come to know it during a long campaign was restored to an apparently indefinite state of rancor. The President-elect has vacillated on some pre-election promises, but the fundamentals of his hardline politics and unpredictable persona have emerged intact. Here is an abridged account of his 21 days on the cusp of power.1. Meets Obama in the afternoon, attacks protesters at nightSitting beside the man whose legitimacy as President he had assailed with baseless accusations for years, Trump played nice, calling their summit a \"great honor\" and expressing his desire to speak again with Obama \"many, many more times.\"At 9:10 p.m. that night, he tweeted: \"A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!\"Nine minutes later, though, he switched gears, attacking protesters who had rallied against him in a number of major US cities.\"Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\"2. Settles the Trump University lawsuit, agreeing to pay $25 million With a court date on the horizon, the President-elect settled three suits against his defunct real estate seminar business. The victims -- some 6,000 former students -- will receive a sum total of $25 million, or at least half of their money back. Why did he back down after past promises to take the case to trial? \"I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,\" Trump tweeted. 3. Goes to Twitter war with the cast of 'Hamilton'Ten days after the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended a Friday night performance of the super smash-hit Broadway musical. As the play ended, cast member Brandon Dixon addressed Pence from the stage, saying the cast represented \"the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious\" about the new administration.\"But we truly hope,\" he continued, \"this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" Despite the mild nature of the remarks, the video went viral. Trump reacted the next morning, tweeting that Pence had been \"harassed.\" A few minutes later, he added: \"The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\"When none was forthcoming, Trump again (in a since-deleted tweet) called Dixon's words \"insulting\" and mocked him for not memorizing the lines. 4. Names Steve Bannon, alt right hero, his top adviserTrump's first major post-election decision was to select Bannon, his campaign CEO and the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as his chief strategist and senior counselor.The chief of staff job went to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, but the headlines belonged to Bannon, who has been accused of domestic violence and making anti-Semitic comments. The decision to install him in such an influential position drew immediate and sharp opposition from groups like the Anti-Defamation League and top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who called the hire a continuation of the \"hateful and divisive vision that defined (Trump's) campaign.\"The self-described \"alt-right\" is considered by many to be a right-wing neo-Nazi-type movement. 5. Says maybe he won't seek to prosecute Hillary Clinton\"It's just not something I feel very strongly about,\" Trump said during a meeting with reporters from The New York Times. \"I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't,\" Trump added, either skirting a potential abuse of power -- the attorney general, though appointed by the President, does not take orders from the White House on specific targets for investigation or prosecution -- or oblivious to the standard. \"She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.\"The comments marked a stark reversal from the second presidential debate in October, when Trump told Clinton that, if he won, \"I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\"6. Talks to President Obama 'regularly'Trump led the racist birther movement against Obama, who before and during the campaign, was a relentless and mocking critic. But following their meeting at the White House days after the election, the men have apparently taken to speaking \"regularly\" on the phone.\"You know, beyond the sitdown they had 30 hours or so after President-elect Trump won the election, they've been talking regularly on any number of issues,\" Trump top aide Kellyanne Conway told NBC on Sunday. \"They talked just yesterday (for about 45 minutes).\"The contents of the conversations are, for now, a mystery.7. Ousts Christie and allies from his transition teamNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one of the first mainstream Republicans to back Trump, standing loyally at his side during much of the primary. For his trouble, the New Jersey governor was named head of Trump's transition team, a job he worked at quietly as the campaign seemed to be sputtering toward defeat.But after Trump's historic upset, Christie got a second -- and final, as it turned out -- look from the President-elect. Within days, he and former Congressman Mike Rogers had been ousted as Pence took over the operation.Why the quick hook? Among the most prominent theories: Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, held a grudge against the former US attorney for successfully prosecuting his father, Charles Kushner, for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions back in 2004.  8. Stands by as top aide publicly campaigns against potential appointmentPerhaps the most unlikely candidate for the new cabinet, Mitt Romney, has divided opinion among Trump loyalists. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee has run hot and cold with Trump, soliciting his endorsement four years ago then blasting him in March as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"Though Trump seems open to a reconciliation -- the two, along with Priebus, shared an intimate dinner Tuesday night -- Conway has been vocal in her opposition. And not just in conversations with the boss. Last Thursday, she tweeted about a \"deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney\" and linked to a Politico story headlined, \"Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as secretary of state.\"9. Tells supporters to stop harassing minorities\"I am so saddened to hear that,\" Trump told CBS' Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" after she brought up the mounting reports of harassment against Muslims and Latinos. \"And I say, 'Stop it.' If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'\"Trump, though, mostly pleaded ignorance to the broader issue, saying he had only heard about a handful of attacks. By November 16 -- a week out from the election and a few days after the interview -- the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded 701 incidents across the country. 10. Asks about security clearances for his kids -- or not?Initial reports from a week after the election suggested the Trump transition team had asked about top security clearances for his elder children and son-in-law, a claim denied by a campaign spokesman. Conway provided a little more information the next day, saying there had been discussion but no explicit inquiry.\"It doesn't sound like it was a formal request,\" she told Fox News.  11. Praises the 'genius' of the Electoral CollegeIn 2012, Trump called it a \"disaster for democracy.\" That was late on Election Day, when he thought Obama would lose the popular vote but win reelection over Romney. (Obama would eventually catch up and surpass the Republican.)Four years on, Trump, himself losing the popular vote but ascending to the presidency based on a strong Electoral College performance, took a different view.\"The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play,\" he tweeted. \"Campaigning is much different!\"12. Claims massive fraud as reason he is losing popular voteThe comment above came on November 15. Trump was mum on the issue over the next two weeks, but as the margin in the popular vote surpassed 2 million, he lashed out.On the Sunday afternoon of Thanksgiving weekend, he tweeted -- falsely and without evidence -- that he \"won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"There have been no reputable reports of mass fraud.In addition to the bogus claim, Trump later pinned his looming defeat in the \"so-called popular vote\" on the apparently less than \"genius\" Electoral College, which, he argued in an additional pair of tweets, altered his campaign strategy. 13. Brushes off concerns about conflicts of interest Trump's business ties -- which span 144 companies in at least 25 countries, according to recent financial disclosures -- could have untold implicit and explicit influence over foreign and domestic policy decisions. Calls for Trump to put his assets in a blind trust have mostly been dismissed. And it might not matter anyway -- given the high profile nature of his holdings, it would be impossible for Trump to remain unaware of their fortunes. One solution would involve liquidating his assets, but that's never been serious considered. The expectation now is that his children will run the businesses -- a plan that's already drawn criticism after daughter Ivanka Trump was photographed during her father's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a Trump building plan in Argentina broke through some sticky red tape not long after the election.14. Lobbied the UK to give a major diplomatic post to his political allyPerhaps bored with stocking his own cabinet, Trump in a tweet on November 21 suggested that his ideological ally and campaign pal, the right-wing former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, would make a fine diplomat.\"Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States,\" Trump wrote. \"He would do a great job!\"But a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May quickly shot down the idea. Farage is a longtime opponent of May's Conservative Party and the job is already filled. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -- like Farage, one of the leading Brexit advocates -- laughed off the tension with a droll reminder during a session of parliament.\"We have a first-rate ambassador in Washington doing a very good job of relating both with the present administration and with the administration to be, and there is no vacancy for that position,\" he said.15. Is maybe offering Ben Carson the HUD secretary jobAfter Carson, a former presidential primary rival turned Trump ally, reportedly turned down an offer to run the Department of Health and Human Services citing a lack of experience in running a government agency, Trump approached him about another gig.That job, leading the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has emerged as a more appealing option to Carson, a retired neurosurgeon with no background in housing policy.No official word yet from the transition team on the offer.16. Chooses Mike Flynn to be his national security adviserTrump tapped retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, a vocal campaign surrogate and controversial former Obama administration employee, to be his closest national security aide. A well-regarded intelligence officer for many years, Flynn was fired by the current White House from his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.Flynn has been called out recently for his social media activity -- which includes interactions with anti-Semitic accounts, a claim that \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL,\" and efforts to spread conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton. Flynn has also pushed insidious rumors that Islamic Sharia law is on the march in the US and ran a lobbying company with foreign clients while he was receiving classified intelligence briefings during the campaign. 17. Picks Sen. Jeff Sessions as his attorney general nomineeLike Flynn, the Alabama Senator is a controversial choice. Unlike the former, though, he will need to be confirmed by his colleagues in the upper chamber. Civil Rights groups have already lined up against Sessions, who has spoken out against the 1965 Voting Rights Act and accused the ACLU and NAACP of having \"forced civil rights down the throats of people.\"There's more. Sessions in 1986 was up for a federal judgeship when allegations he made racist comments to an African-American colleague caused a minor scandal, ultimately scuttling his nomination.Sessions has called the charges \"false\" and told CNN in 2009 that he \"was caricatured in a way that was not me.\" 18. Gets nasty, then nice, with the mediaIn a whirlwind 48 hours, Trump last week first met with top executives and network anchors at Trump Tower, then made a trip to hold court with The New York Times.Trump used the first gathering, with boldface names from the country's five largest TV news outlets, to rip the media, according to a source who spoke to CNN's Brian Stelter.A day later -- after canceling and un-canceling the meeting -- Trump went to the Times, where he answered a wide range of questions as reporters live-tweeted the conversation.After roughly four minutes spent criticizing its coverage, Trump eventually called the paper, which he frequently scorns in his Twitter stream, a \"great great American jewel -- world jewel.\" 19. Eventually sort of disavows right-wing extremistsDuring the Times interview -- which came days after neo-Nazis and white supremacists under the \"alt right\" banner hailed his victory -- Trump told the Times, \"I don't want to energize the group, and I disavow the group ... if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\"He also defended Bannon, who during his time at Breitbart boasted that the site had become \"the platform for the alt-right,\" saying, \"If I thought he was racist, or 'alt-right' ... I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\"  20. Announces plans for a 'thank you' tourAnd you thought the campaign was over. Team Trump on Monday revealed that a rally in downtown Cincinnati on Thursday will mark the first stop on his promised \"thank you\" tour. He is expected to hit a number other battleground states, where Trump and supporters will celebrate the election results.21. But still no press conferencesFor all the news he's made, Trump has yet to hold a news conference since being elected. Most general election winners meet the press in the days or week after the vote. But Trump, for all his blustering online and in negotiated sitdowns with single outlets, hasn't taken questions from a diverse group of reporters since July.On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that he is planning to hold a news conference on December 15.

{"_id":"The Dead Sea is drying out","articleText":" (CNN)Something's happening at the lowest point on our planet, some 1,388 feet below sea level. The Dead Sea, a salt lake nestled by Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, is shrinking at an alarming rate -- about 3.3 feet per year, according to the environmentalist group EcoPeace Middle East. And human actions are largely to blame.\"It's not just like one country is punishing the Dead Sea; it's more like the whole region,\" said photographer Moritz Küstner, who visited the area in February to work on his series \"The Dying Dead Sea.\"The Dead Sea needs water from the other natural sources surrounding it, such as the Jordan River basin. But around the 1960s, some of the water sources it relied upon were diverted. Israel, for instance, built a pipeline during that time so it could supply water throughout the country.Mineral extraction industries are another main reason the water levels are declining, experts say. The Dead Sea's minerals have been hailed for their therapeutic properties and can often be found in cosmetics and other consumer products.And then, of course, there's the Middle East's hot, dry climate, which makes it difficult for the lake to replenish itself. Last year, Israel and Jordan signed a $900 million deal in an effort to stabilize the Dead Sea's water levels. It entails building a canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea so that both countries would be able to not only supply water to Israel and Jordan but also to pump much needed water -- some 300 million cubic meters annually -- into the Dead Sea.\"This is the most important and significant agreement since the peace treaty with Jordan (in 1994),\" said Silvan Shalom, Israel's energy and water resources minister at the time. Whether the canal -- estimated to take three years to complete -- will work out positively and as planned remains to be seen. But for now, Küstner shows us that the Dead Sea remains very much a place of interest, with people from all over the world flocking there to swim in its salty waters.The Dead Sea, known as the Salt Sea in Hebrew, is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, with around 34% salinity. And because of what has been happening over the years, the salt is only getting saltier.Earlier this month, nearly 30 marathon swimmers from around the world -- wanting to bring awareness to the falling water levels -- swam the nine-mile Dead Sea stretch from Jordan to Israel. They wore face masks to protect their eyes and mouths, but one swimmer still described the experience as being \"like acid burning your eyeballs.\"\"It's an unfriendly environment for people to live there or to stay there,\" Küstner said. \"It's really salty and if you taste the Dead Sea, it's not tasting like salty water anymore. It's just tasting toxic.\"Moritz Küstner is a photographer based in Hanover, Germany. He is represented by Agentur Focus.

{"_id":"The Endless Table: How recipes can keep your memories alive","articleText":" (CNN)Chef Jody Adams' father Thomas knew his health was declining when he could no longer complete the New York Times crossword puzzle. The Brown University rare books librarian had never let physical limitations stand in his way, but when his brain stopped working the way he wanted it to -- at age 87 -- he knew that he needed to prepare for the end of his life. Adams' parents discussed his end of life wishes during a quiet, private evening before her mother, Virginia, let the rest of the family know. Thomas had decided to receive hospice care at home and in November 2008, the entire family gathered at his home in Providence, Rhode Island to care for him by his bedside. Adams did what she knew best -- she cooked for him.Food is loveAdams, a famous Boston chef, had learned how to rejoice in food as a child from her father.  . Even though her mother did most of the cooking, he was known for a few mainstays, such as delicious cornmeal pancakes and the perfect mayonnaise, made from a supposedly top secret recipe -- Adams later learned the recipe was verbatim from \"The Joy of Cooking.\" Although her father's appetite was waning, Adams kept cooking for him until the end. He particularly loved the cream of mushroom soup recipe she had created just for him. \"I've always known the importance of food through bringing people together and nurturing them, but I also learned that food can be enormously healing,\" Adams said. \"This was how I could say goodbye with love. I put all of myself into that soup.\"Her father passed away on December 1, 2008. While the family felt the deep impact of his loss, nothing had been left unsaid and her father died the way that he had wanted to, surrounded by his loved ones.  \"We were all very present with him and it allowed him to let go and know that he was forgiven and he was sent off surrounded by love and warmth,\" said Adams. \"It showed me that death can be as important as birth, and as beautiful. Through my father's death, I learned so much about life.\" Adams recently shared her story of loss and food in a digital cookbook, \"The Endless Table: Recipes from Departed Loved Ones.\" She was one of 20 top chefs to share their stories  relating to death in their families.A recipe for discussionThe stories -- and recipes -- for the cookbook were collected and edited by Ellen Goodman of The Conversation Project  and Michael Hebb of Death Over Dinner. They both reached out to chefs they knew, or were acquainted with, like Ina Garten, Jose Andres, Tom Colicchio and Christopher Kimball to ask for their contribution and were amazed by the memories the chefs were willing to share. They shared everything from treasured family recipes to vignettes of personal loss, which inspired Goodman to each share a family recipe, and story, of their own. Many of the chefs had in fact already had these kinds of conversations with their loved ones and shared how liberating it was. They also revealed that making the recipes of their deceased loved helps maintain their memories and a connection to them. This was the aim of the project. As well as maintain connections, Goodman and Hebb want their cookbook to encourage people to have end-of-life discussions with their loved ones before it's too late. Goodman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, co-founded The Conversation Project when she lost her mother to dementia, unable to know what she really wanted in the end when Goodman was faced with making choices on her behalf. Co-foundedBoth Goodman and Hebb have since given TED talks on this subject highlighting how conversations that may seem intimidating, uncomfortable or even scary over a normal and soothing occasion like dinner can break their taboo.\"For some, talking about death is like letting it in the room,\" Goodman said. \"The end of life isn't just a medical thing that happens, it's a human experience. People aren't dying the way they want to or having their wishes honored...so having a conversation like this is a gift you give your family.\" To make things easier, the cookbook also contains a guide on how to approach talking about end-of-life wishes, compiled using advice from both health experts and families who have had successful discussions.Time for a toastApril 16 is National Healthcare Decisions Day, which has inspired Goodman and Hebb to encourage families across the country to use the week as a chance to host a dinner party. They want the occasion to be used to toast one another, honor people who have been lost, and for families to talk about their own end-of-life wishes -- because it's always too soon until it's too late, Goodman said. Hebb, a former restaurateur, came up with the idea for Death Over Dinner when he struck up a conversation about mortality with two physicians on a train. This led to a class Hebb taught at the University of Washington in 2012 -- The Table of Truth: Reimagining the Dinner Table as Digital Media -- and soon grew into a social campaign. To date, over 100,000 dinner parties inspired by Death Over Dinner have taken place across the country. The diners begin by going around the room and acknowledging someone who has passed away and had a positive impact on people's lives, and raise a glass in their memory. The group can then decide how to progress in a \"choose your own adventure\" style approach, depending on who is in the group and the intention of the conversation. Based on the intention, they can work from a series of prompts provided by Hebb's website. A popular prompt asks what someone would do if they knew they had only 30 days left to live: How would they spend it, where are they, who are they with and what about the final day and hours of that day? \"Vulnerability begets vulnerability. People who have nothing in common reach a common ground almost immediately around this topic,\" said Hebb. \"It's people looking inside themselves within a group setting.\"Hebb has seen the dinners change the relationship between a parent and a child as they each reveal things they've never told anyone else. \"It's not that people are afraid, it just needs a proper place. So just honor it with the space and time that it needs,\" he said.Jasper White, a fellow Boston chef, also shared his recipes and memories in the digital cookbook and opened up during the project to stress that every death is not a tragedy. \"Love never dies,\" said White. \"Neither do recipes, and it's a wonderful way to remember someone.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/health/endless-table-death-over-dinner/index.html"}
{"_id":"The Trump pledge: No lobbying for 5 years","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Two top Republicans working with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team told reporters in a phone call Wednesday evening that they're taking steps toward one of Trump's campaign promises -- to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.Trump communications director Jason Miller and Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer announced anyone being vetted for a high post in the administration must provide a termination of lobbying form if they are a registered lobbyist.In addition, when officials leave the government, they will be banned from being a lobbyist for five years as part of the agreement to serve in Trump's administration. The ban will apply lifetime to representing foreign governments, he added Thursday.\"Not only will people not be able to (be) registered state or federal lobbyists, but when they leave government, they will be banned from being a registered lobbyist for five years,\" Spicer said Wednesday.\"Why that is crucial is that it goes back to Mr. Trump's goal of making sure that people aren't using the government to enrich themselves and using their service in government to do that,\" he added.President Barack Obama imposed a two-year lobbying ban for officials who left his administration, a policy instituted by executive order on his first day in office. Why hasn't Trump's transition team called the Pentagon?Any ban on lobbying, however, depends on how it is written and enforced. A common practice in Washington is for key power players not to register as a lobbyist, but instead work as a consultant or adviser -- allowing them to take their experience and contacts to make hundreds of thousands of dollars on K Street.The announcement comes as Trump's transition team works to remove lobbyists from its ranks after Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over the efforts from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The transition operation working before Election Day was staffed with long-time Washington experts and lobbyists from K Street, think tanks and political offices, drawing questions about Trump's commitment to reforms.On \"60 Minutes\" Sunday, Trump acknowledged the transition team was stacked with DC insiders. \"Everybody's a lobbyist down there,\" he said.\"That's the problem with the system -- the system,\" Trump said. \"We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\"Trump said relying on lobbyists now while planning to eliminate them later is no contradiction.\"I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out,\" Trump said.CNN's Tal Kopan, Eric Bradner, Noah Gray and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/lobbying-donald-trump-washington-swamp-transition/index.html"}
{"_id":"The US economy in GIFs from Steve Mnuchin's movies","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump announced Steve Mnuchin as his pick for Treasury secretary Tuesday. Mnuchin is not only a former hedge fund manager and banker -- he's also credited as the producer on more than 30 movies. So what kind of economy would Mnuchin be inheriting as the head of the Treasury? What are his plans for the US economy? We thought it'd be most appropriate to explain it in GIFs from some of his films. The back storyFirst of all, the Federal Reserve's interest rate could go up soon. That means credit card and mortgage rates would go with it. Like a punch to the gut and/or the face.The unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 4.9%. It's hovered between 4.7% and 5% the entire year.The stock market has seen some record highs since Trump's victory at the beginning of November. Just last week, the Dow closed above 19,000 for the first time ever. The US debt is estimated at more than $19 trillion. When Obama took office in January 2009, the debt was $10.6 trillion.US gross domestic product (GDP) saw 3.2% growth in the 3rd quarter and consumer spending was up by 2.8%. Both are good signs for the economy.Median household income in the US rose to about $56,000 in 2015. That's more than a 5% increase from 2014. We can all drink to that.Coming attractionsSo what is Mnuchin wanting to do at Treasury? Well, first he's going to have to face off with the Senate for his confirmation hearing.Remember that time the housing market exploded? Mnuchin's probably going to get heat for his involvement with IndyMac, the sub-prime home loan lender that he bought in 2009. If he makes it past the Senate, Mnuchin wants to implement a \"bold economic agenda.\"Mnuchin told CNBC that he wants to do the largest tax overhaul since President Ronald Reagan's administration. President-elect Trump has previously said that he wants to slash the tax brackets from seven to three. In the same interview, Mnuchin promised corporate tax rates will fall in an effort to encourage domestic job growth. Want more info?

{"_id":"The app lending eyes to the blind","articleText":" (CNN)Two years ago South African Chris Venter lost his eyesight from a virus he contracted while travelling. A former chef, he was determined to keep cooking. To do so, he's had to relearn how to navigate a kitchen and even how to chop onions. If he wants to pour milk, he has a device that beeps when the glass is nearly full.But there are still obstacles, like seeing the color of the onion, or the milk's expiration date.Enter a new app, BeSpecular, which connects Venter to volunteers around the world who want to lend their eyes to the blind.\"The first time I used it I was about to chop an onion and I was uncertain if it was a white or red onion that I'd taken, so I snapped a picture,\" the 43-year-old blogger said. Once the request is submitted, a handful of volunteers, or so-called \"sightlings\", receive a notification on their smartphones.\"It took me about 30 seconds before I had the first response,\" Venter adds.The app launched on World Sight Day on October 13, 2016, and has so far had around 10,000 subscribers, with a roughly equal split between the visually impaired and volunteers, according to the company, based in Johannesburg, South Africa.The idea for the app was conceived at Stanford University in 2014, where CEO Stephanie Cowper and CTO Giacomo Parmeggiani were classmates.\"We wanted to have a big impact on people's lives using tech,\" Cowper says. \"The disability industry was somewhere we could actually make a big difference.\" Can this smartphone app help the blind to see again?Similar to dating appsThe app uses an algorithm to connect the right people, much like a dating app.The requests go out to volunteers of similar age and physical location to the visually impaired, Cowper explains.\"Things are very culturally specific in terms of brands.\" Take Twinings Tea or the popular English spread Marmite, for example. \"Even if someone shows you the back of the pack or jar, you would probably still recognize what it was,\" she said. Sending the request to more than one person puts less pressure on the volunteers, Cowper says. \"If you're busy, you don't have to worry.\"How to use a smartphone when you can't seeLike others with visual impairment, Venter navigates his smartphone using a touch-based interface and synthetic speech.\"My screen just looks blank. As I slide my finger around the touch screen, whatever I'm hovering over will be read to me, so I can just double-tap it to open it up.\"BeSpecular isn't the only app helping the visually impaired. Another uses algorithms to identify what's in the picture, such as mobile camera application TapTapSee, which automatically identifies objects. Others, such as the Danish app Be My Eyes lets users interact directly through a live video feed.Chris Danielsen, a director at the National Federation of the Blind, in the U.S., says while these apps can be very useful, there are some caveats to consider. The privacy of the blind user is one example. \"You want to be careful when you're sharing information with a third party that you don't know. As a blind person I tend to be very careful with anything of a personal nature.\" Can an app replace human contact?Then there is the question of whether an app can replace human contact.Danielsen says the apps are likely to be an additional service to friends or already available human assistance, which is still his preference when going shopping, for example.\"It's always better to have somebody who knows you and who knows how to work with you,\" added Danielsen. From Japan to Finland to Mexico, BeSpecular has users in over 50 countries worldwide, according to the company.Next up for BeSpecular is translating the app into other languages and launching a business software -- currently being tested by a number of companies in South Africa -- that aims to raise awareness of disability in the workplace in Africa, where there is still social stigma around blindness, Cowper says.\"We are hoping to break down those barriers and get people talking.\" ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/africa/be-specular-app-helps-the-blind/index.html"}
{"_id":"The best things to do in Estonia's capital, Tallinn","articleText":" (CNN)The words \"former Soviet\" carry with them some baggage -- usually grim, gray baggage that most travelers would prefer to avoid. That's not the case in Estonia's capital Tallinn. In the 25 years since the USSR last exerted control over the city, it's undergone what can only be described as a cultural revolution.And while it's often grouped with Scandinavian and Nordic near-neighbors, the Baltic Sea coast's oldest capital has a distinct identity, very different from the rest of Europe.Some of Tallinn's appeal is rooted in its rich history.Its UNESCO-protected old town has winding alleyways, ornate doorways and medieval courtyards. Kings, queens and czars have walked the streets of the charming two-tiered city.It's now starting to attract a cool and young affluent crowd in search of foodie delights and luxury boutique hotels. And then there's the new town.The modern and thriving metropolis is home to more startup companies per capita than any other city in Europe.It's where global household names like Skype were born. Estonians are extremely proud of their entrepreneurial prowess -- particularly where digital business is concerned. Here are some of the best things to experience in Tallinn, a city of tradition, innovation, food and culture.  Take in sweeping views from a rooftop barFor a drink with a view, the Radisson Blu Sky Hotel offers one of the best vantage points in town. The vista takes in the spires and rooftops of Tallinn's medieval old town and the Baltic Sea from the rooftop bar, which stands at 90 meters tall. Lounge 24 sits in a prized location on the 24th floor. Cocktails can be enjoyed indoors or on the outdoor terrace.

The old town is not all that big and is perfect for getting lost in. With its pastel-colored buildings all pretty in a row, the Town Hall Square is reminiscent of pages from a children's fairytale book. The old medieval heart of Tallinn is ripe for exploring galleries and craft workshops. From fabric makers to ceramics stores, paintings and artwork to jewelery artisans, if there's an art that can be perfected with the hands, there's almost certainly a workshop for it in the old town.Enjoy contemporary Estonian cuisineOn many review sites and \"where to eat\" guides, Rataskaevu 16 is listed as the number one place to eat in Tallinn's old town and it doesn't disappoint. The name is literally the street address, with the owners maintaining they couldn't come up with a name for a while so thought best to keep it simple. That's what they do with their food too. Contemporary but honoring all the Estonian classics, the menu reads like a local market produce listing, from freshly salted salmon to fried Baltic herring to salad with dried elk meat and roasted duck leg. The seasons dictate the restaurant's hearty soups and the bread pudding is a modern take on the classic that Estonians would normally eat at grandma's on Sundays. Bookings are essential.

Symbolic of Estonia's oppression under the empire, in the first quarter of the 20th century it was scheduled for a demolition that never took place due to lack of funding. It was fully restored to its former glory when Estonia became independent from the Soviet Union. The interior is all copper, zinc, granite, mosaics, gilded iron crosses and stained glass.

In the December issue of Architectural Digest, the first family gives an exclusive tour of their private living quarters on the White House's second floor, from the family dining room to the master suite. \"Their private quarters remain an oasis of civility and, yes, refined taste in a political arena so often bereft of both,\" wrote journalist Mayer Rus of the largely neutral, simple interiors.

{"_id":"The homes left behind by ISIS","articleText":" (CNN)Where there is danger, where there is death, there is also responsibility.For Magnus Wennman, it is that responsibility and drive to tell a story that has catapulted him from war zone to war zone and conflict to conflict.In the past 20 years, the Swedish photographer has seen his share of blood and violence. But the plight of the Iraqi people -- and those ensconced in the middle of the battle for Mosul -- has taken the meaning of warfare to a new level.\"I would say this is probably the worst situation I've seen,\" Wennman said.\"There is no filter, no one can feel safe, and there are no safe areas. This conflict is so brutal. (ISIS militants) are not concerned if it's civilians, journalists or anyone -- they are all the enemy. It's a very, very scary situation.\"Wennman, working for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, was embedded with Kurdish Peshmerga troops on the opening day of the assault on Mosul. He was allowed to enter a number of villages that had been inhabited by ISIS troops before they were driven out by coalition forces.He was guided past hundreds of booby traps and improvised explosive devices to homes that had housed ISIS fighters and a huge collection of bomb-making equipment.\"Everything was pretty much destroyed because of the battle the day before,\" he said.\"In my opinion, the people who were living there didn't really prepare for a life there. There was bomb-making equipment everywhere. It seemed that the people who had lived there were just preparing for war.\"Wennman had visited Iraq a month earlier to chart the journey of refugees who were fleeing the violence. He returned to tell a story, which he says has become \"the most important of the year.\"His \"Where the Children Sleep\" series, in which he documented the struggles of Syrian refugees, touched hearts across the world and was universally lauded.He has witnessed a number of harrowing sights and at times wrestled with the emotional side of his work, as he did during his most recent trip to Iraq.\"I think in one way you have to protect yourself from feelings,\" he said, \"and you do that with the help of your camera and profession.

{"_id":"The man Americans loved to hate","articleText":"Louis A. Perez Jr. is the J. Carlyle Sitterson professor of history and the director of the Institute for the Study of the Americas at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Among his books are \"Cuba in the American Imagination: Metaphor and the Imperial Ethos\" and \"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Fidel Castro Ruz, the political personality, has died. Fidel Castro, the historical persona, has been born. He passes from the present into the past, to serve as an enduring historical subject of debate and dispute, about whom dispassion will be impossible for years to come. Fidel Castro was not a man about whom one is likely to be neutral.           Fidel is a metaphor. He is a Rorschach blot upon which to project fears or hopes.  A prism in which the spectrum of colors refracted out has to do with light that went in. He is a point of view, loaded with ideological purport and political meaning. A David who survived Goliath. A symbol of Third World intransigence against First World domination. But it is also possible to discuss the historical \"essences\" of Fidel Castro. He emerged out of a history shaped by a century of Cuban national frustration, heir to a legacy of unfulfilled hopes for national sovereignty and self-determination, aspirations that put Cuba on a collision course with the United States. The collision of the early 1960s served to fix the trajectory of the 50 years of ruptured relations that followed.  There was something deeply personal about the Cuba-U.S. estrangement.  Fidel Castro offended American sensibilities. The sheer effrontery of Castro's challenge to the United States was breathtaking: defiant, strident, often virulent denunciations of the United States, hours at a time, day after day, stretching into weeks and months, and years.Castro's invective was more than adequately reciprocated by American vilification. Fidel Castro was held personally responsible for almost all the challenges the United States faced in Central and South America, in the Caribbean, in Africa. Castro was transformed simultaneously into an anathema and phantasma, unscrupulous and perhaps unbalanced, possessed by demons and given to evil doings.He defied years of US efforts at regime change and his very defiance transformed him into something of an enduring national obsession. Castro occupied a place of almost singular distinction in that netherworld to which the United States banished its demons.  He was the man Americans loved to hate; political conflict personalized; decades of frustration over the US' unsuccessful attempts to force Cuba to bend its  will -- all this vented on one man. Certainly, scores of assassination plots against the life of Castro could not have made American wrath any more personal.  And, yes: the missiles of October 1962. Castro would never be forgiven. It is highly unlikely that any American administration could have embarked on a US-Cuba rapprochement with Fidel Castro in power.His death leaves something of a void in Cuba. Not in the form of a power vacuum, of course, but as the absence of a voice and the loss of a presence.  Even old, feeble and in failing health, beset with infirmities, and perhaps with traces of senility, Fidel continued to discharge the role of symbol.  He was suspicious of President Barack Obama's rapprochement initiatives. He no doubt would have been alarmed by the campaign rhetoric of President-elect Donald Trump.  The Republican Party platform inaugurated the 2016 electoral campaign prepared to welcome \"Cuba back into our hemispheric family after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to account for their crimes against humanity.\"  The President-elect vowed to roll back all \"concessions\" made to Cuba unless the \"regime meets our demands,\" demands that include \"religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.\"  At this stage of US-Cuba relations, the very proposition of American \"demands\" on Cuba bode ill for continued normalization.  A people who have endured 60 years of privation over the course of 11 presidential administrations in defense of national sovereignty and self-determination will not likely acquiesce to demands of a 12th administration.  In passing from the present to the past, Fidel will henceforth speak from the grave.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/opinions/cuba-after-castro-perez/index.html"}
{"_id":"The man behind North Korea's next generation of architects","articleText":" (CNN)Mega monuments, symmetrical Soviet-style high rises and grand boulevards. That's what normally comes to mind when picturing North Korean architecture. But the streets of Pyongyang are evolving. Curved lines, asymmetric designs and pops of color are enriching new areas such as Mirae Scientists Street -- a new residential area next to next to Pyongyang Station -- showcasing an eclectic mix of building styles that would have been inconceivable a decade ago.And with North Korea's annual infrastructure spending growing nearly 10% since 2014, there's plenty of opportunity for architects to flex their design muscles. Amid the building boom, foreign architects including Singapore-based Calvin Chua have seized the rare opportunity to help shape the next generation of North Korean architects. Chua, the founder of Spatial Anatomy design firm, runs Architectural Association School of Architecture (AA) Visiting School program, which with the non-profit Choson Exchange program provides training to North Koreans. International architecture students visit North Korea for 10 days to work with local students and architects on different design approaches in urban development.CNN spoke with the Singapore University of Technology and Design adjunct assistant professor about working with North Korean architects and students, and how they're transforming the cityscape.  When did you first visit North Korea?I went there in 2008 as a tourist. The first impression I had was the city's monumentality -- the strategically distributed public squares, monuments, and strong vistas along the boulevards in Pyongyang. From that perspective, the city was orderly and well-choreographed.What defines North Korean architecture?Most of the buildings are made of concrete, because that's the material that's readily available. To import steel from China would be too expensive. And because of all the sanctions, it's even more difficult. The entire city was flattened after the Korean War (1950-1953), so to some extent, a lot of the architectural styles and influences really came from the initial assistance provided by other communist states like East Germany and the Soviet Union. How is working in North Korea different from visiting as a tourist?As a tourist, you'll be so bombarded by the monuments and boulevards that it's hard to appreciate what's unique about North Korean architecture. After going to North Korea many times, you start to discover the small details of the city rather than the giant monuments. The way each house has a small balcony and everyone has potted plants -- that interests me much more because it reflects how people live in the city. Or the presence of mini department stores -- basically, shops where you can buy anything, from shoes to clothes to solar panels within 1,000 square feet (100 sqm). That's uniquely Pyongyang. You don't find that in other cities.What surprised your students about working in North Korea?It's a general perception that North Koreans are not very vocal. I think that when you talk about something that is more politically neutral, like urban planning or architecture, they can be critical and analytical. A lot of people never expect the North Korean participants to be so forthcoming with their ideas -- that's been a pleasant surprise. What types of projects do the students work on?Instead of designing the types of architecture that are already prevalent in Pyongyang, we focus on developing urban strategies for challenging sites in the city.For example, we look at how to adaptively reuse and change old or empty buildings -- that is conceptually new for the North Korean architects. Typically in North Korea, you would simply refurbish or demolish an existing building rather than changing its function. Despite the building boom, a number of buildings are empty in the city. It is important to consider how to adaptively reuse these existing buildings, rather than tearing them down.What's it like to work with North Korean architects?North Korean architects are very skilled with their design software. They are able to produce drawings and models, or even renderings, at a very fast speed. There is, however, a difference in how we approach design. In North Korea, architecture is a very formulaic practice, whereas the foreign students tend to spend more time thinking about the context, and the theoretical implications of design strategies.How has architecture in North Korea changed over time?If you look at the timeline of development in Pyongyang you can broadly break it down into a few phases. The 1950s was a neoclassical period where East German and Soviet architects were invited to participate in design projects in Pyongyang. Then we have the modernist era in the 60s and 70s, which was followed by the revival of vernacular Korean architectural elements, like Korean hipped roofs, built with concrete in the 80s. And more recently? What trends are you seeing?The architecture is evolving. The practice is driven by the amount of construction that's taking place in the city. Increasingly, they are moving away from standardized designs. North Korean architects are inventing more individual qualities in their buildings. So in the past, if you looked at older neighborhood, or even streets, like Kwangbok Street and Tongil Street -- all the buildings were designed, composed and replicated in a particular way that shared a similar geometrical language.And in the new developments?If you look at newer streets, like Mirae Street and Ryomyong Street, within a short span of just half a mile (1 kilometer), you get a diverse collection of buildings with different forms and façades.. For example, you get to see 30-story towers being erected in the middle of a low-rise urban block, which would have been unthinkable in the past. It seems to suggest that the planners, the architects, are slowly deviating away from a more cohesive, coherent urban design. What are some major concerns among North Korean architects?It ranges from technical issues such as improving insulation and waterproofing for buildings to developing a sustainable development framework for the city. We have led discussions and workshops on a series of issues, for example how to develop a sustainability guideline for the city. Is it hard for foreign architects to work in North Korea?It's slightly more difficult for architects to get involved in projects in North Korea -- firstly, the local architects are very capable themselves. Also, the lack of communication lines make it really difficult. You can't hold a Skype call, for example. You can email, but the best way to communicate is to be there in person.

{"_id":"The maverick designer who dresses China's first lady","articleText":"Beijing (CNN)Chinese couturier Ma Ke is a media-shy fashion-world maverick. She's built two of China's most influential designer brands and dresses the country's first lady, Peng Liyuan -- but doesn't consider herself a designer.  Preferring a reclusive life in Zhuhai, a city on China's southern coast that's a world away from the country's fashion hubs in Shanghai and Beijing, Ma never reads fashion magazines, shuns parties and rarely gives interviews.For this exclusive, CNN wasn't allowed to take photos at the opening of her new exhibition, nor did she want to supply a head shot. \"I don't belong in fashion circles,\" she says.  Chen Man: China's 'Annie Leibovitz' is changing how the world sees ChinaFirst lady of fashionMa may shun media attention, but her fashion success speaks volumes in itself.Hugely influential in China's fashion world for her brands Wuyong and Exception de Mixmind, the designer became a household name when China's first lady wore one of her designs on her first official overseas trip in 2013.The double-breasted dark navy trench coat she chose, paired with a light turquoise silk scarf, set Chinese social media alight. Peng's unfussy, structured and elegant looks also received rave reviews abroad -- Vanity Fair included her on its best-dressed list that year.To many, Peng's strong look broke the mold of the usually subdued fashion choices made by China's first ladies of the past.\"It fits her well, as she is a soldier and she has a kind of assertiveness and toughness,\" Ma tells CNN of the now-famous trench coat, the first time she's confirmed which outfits she's designed for Peng. Ma has known China's first lady since 2002, and through her designs, she says she wants to convey the inner confidence of modern Chinese women.\"You know sometimes clothing can come across aggressive when it's too revealing and eye-catching and it's the opposite of traditional Chinese aesthetics,\" she says.\"Women don't need to use clothing as a weapon if they're confident in their character and cultivation.\"Shanghai Fashion Week: Highlights from the emerging fashion capitalIt's ensured Peng, who was a famous folk singer before becoming first lady, is compared to fashion icons like Kate Middleton and Michelle Obama, both of whom have helped emerging designers become stars.  \"My philosophy for the first lady's designs is elegance, subtlety and demureness,\" Ma adds.Chinese style isn't what you thinkIt's a philosophy that Ma has drawn from her deep appreciation of traditional Chinese design.  While many regard the form-fitting cheongsam or qipao as epitomizing Chinese style, Ma, who reads Chinese classics extensively, says the opposite is true. \"In Western values, women are beautiful if they are sexy. Chinese design is more concealing.\"\"Like the traditional Chinese ink painting, the blank space between fabric and skin is where the beauty resides,\" she says. Ma also draws on tradition for her couture designs for her Wuyong brand, employing techniques such as loom weaving, hand-sewing and natural coloring. Her unusual textures, architectural shapes and earthy colors led to her becoming the first Chinese designer to be invited by one of high fashion's most respected bodies, Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, to show at Paris Haute Couture week in 2008. READ: Egypt is getting a new capital -- courtesy of ChinaIt's a theme she's also exploring further with her latest venture, an exhibition she has curated and installed in her Beijing Wuyong showroom called \"In search of the clothes with the best stories.\" Ma says she wants to highlight traditional Chinese design with her exhibition, and support the people who produce handcrafted products in China's rural areas.\"I went to the rural areas many times to study traditional clothes making techniques and I was impressed. I decided to help rejuvenate the traditional craftsmanship,\" she says.\"Clothes crafted with care and love last longer,\" she adds. \"If we don't seize the time, we'll lose lots of previous cultural heritage.\"\"In search of the clothes with the best stories\" runs from October 29, 2016 to April 15, 2017 at Wuyong Space, 77 Meishuguan Back St, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China.","articleCategory":["style"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/fashion/china-fashion-ma-ke/index.html"}
{"_id":"The more alcohol ads kids see, the more alcohol they consume","articleText":"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv. (CNN)My girls, 8 and 10, really enjoy watching football, but I have to admit I cringe every time they see yet another beer commercial during a live game.They already know the names of several beers, and we don't drink beer, and basically don't drink much at all. Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid's exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I'm thinking it's time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.\"For a long time, a lot of people said, 'Well advertising doesn't really make a difference,' \" when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said Dr. Timothy Naimi, the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University's Schools of Medicine and Public Health.Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they're more likely to drink that brand, he said. What's been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don't just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.The new study, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.What they found is those underage drinkers who didn't see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider the findings of another study, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\"I think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,\" said Naimi.Parents the greatest influence on a child's drinkingRalph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of Responsibility.org, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country's biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents -- more than advertising -- play the biggest role in determining a kid's decision to drink.Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children's decision to drink versus advertising, according to the 2016 Roper Youth Report (PDF).A recent national survey by Responsibility.org also found that nearly two-thirds of 10- to 18-year-olds cite their parents as the leading influence in their decision whether to drink. Behind parents, the young people cited friends/peers (46%) and brothers/sisters and other family members (32%). Only 14% said advertising/media affects their decision whether to drink, Blackman said.\"While alcohol expenditures have increased, the truth of the matter is that the rate of underage drinking continues to decline,\" said Blackman. \"According to the 2015 Monitoring the Future  study, alcohol consumption continues to show significant decreases among the nation's eighth, 10th and 12th graders. For the three grades combined, the proportion of students reporting annual and past month alcohol consumption reached the lowest level since the study began.\"A self-regulating industry What I didn't realize is the alcohol industry pretty much regulates itself when it comes to alcohol advertising on television. Manufacturers have their own guidelines, such as limiting ads to programs that have a mostly adult audience, but alcohol companies don't always follow their own guidelines. (Have you watched a Super Bowl lately and noticed how many beer commercials air during that program, when the audience includes many children as well as adults?)There is also apparently no penalty for violations of these guidelines, but researchers hope more attention to studies such as this one could increase the pressure for change.\"I think one of the implications for the broader society is that currently our controls on television advertising for alcohol are minimal and they're self-regulatory, so I think we should definitely tighten up that some,\" Naimi said.There is a message here for parents, too. First, realize the influence you have on your children's decision whether to drink, and have the conversation about drinking with them early on so the subject is not taboo. (Check out Responsibiilty.org's #TalkEarly campaign on how to have the talk with your kids.) Second, be mindful about how much time your kids are spending watching television and what they are watching.\"I think it's another good argument for limiting screen time, because alcohol advertising is pervasive even among shows that may be watched by a large number of underage youth,\" said Naimi.Do you think there should be more regulation of alcohol television advertising that kids see?

{"_id":"The president's diet and what it says about America","articleText":" (CNN)Thomas Jefferson may have been America's first foodie. The Founding Father developed a taste for French cuisine, grew a vast vegetable garden and cherished a farm-to-table diet.Abraham Lincoln was more of a modest eater. According to historians, the 16th president \"liked apples and hot coffee,\" and didn't demand much in a meal.On the other hand, Ronald Reagan was known for his sweet tooth. The country's 40th president munched on jelly beans to quit smoking and quickly fell in love with the candy, often keeping a stash nearby in the White House.Now, it seems that a fast food connoisseur will enter the White House. President-elect Donald Trump has been known to favor Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and the taco bowls that are whipped up in Trump Tower's kitchen.\"But he's not the first one to like McDonald's and Burger King and occasionally that wonderful Popeyes chicken,\" said William Seale, a historian and journal editor with the White House Historical Association.\"Fast food makes its way through the doors of the White House. From time to time, presidents or even guests will order a Big Mac or the like, and the Secret Service will go pick it up,\" Seale said. \"The Carter children did that and George W. Bush, too.\"Bill Clinton also was known to enjoy items on the McDonald's menu, so much so that his eating habits were parodied on Saturday Night Live. After all, the eating habits of American presidents seem to mirror the ever-evolving diets of the American people, said Suzy Evans, a Newport Beach, California-based literary agent, historian and author of the forthcoming children's book \"Abraham Lincoln's Lunch.\"\"Presidential culinary history might seem insignificant or even trivial,\" Evans said. \"But if you look closely enough, it can teach us much about American social, cultural and political history and the rich and venerable history of dining, diplomacy and the American presidency.\"The president who just wanted cornbread When it comes to America's interest in food, there was an infatuation with European cuisine in the late 1700s and early 1800s. That seemed to shift around the late 1800s -- a change that was reflected in James Polk's food preferences. He was the 11th president of the United States.\"President Polk was a very finicky eater, and he didn't like the fancy food that came up from the White House kitchen,\" Seale said. \"He wrote of a banquet repast in his diary, 'I saw the food and I couldn't tell what it was. It must have been French' ... Instead, he asked for turnip greens and cornbread.\"Before about 1950, nearly all presidents thrived on natural food from the farm, Seale said. Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman preferred such dishes as turnips, string beans, beets and other farm products, prepared in the simplest ways.\"The Roosevelts used to send things from their Hyde Park vegetable garden down to the White House,\" Seale said. \"They drank pure whole milk, meats and other products from their Hudson River farm,\" he said. \"The coming of restaurants and specialist chefs changed that in the sense that creative and even exotic dishes teased the public interest. Plain roast beef became buried in sauces. Especially during the Kennedy administration did international cooking, particularly French, take over the White House kitchens.\"In the late 1800s, large meals and increasingly sedentary lifestyles had become the norm for wealthier Americans.As a result, several presidents in the mid-19th century to early 20th century -- from William Howard Taft to Theodore Roosevelt -- had rotund body types, said Amy Bentley, a historian and professor of food studies at New York University.\"This is an era of increased food supply and the industrialization of food. For men especially, large bodies are emblematic of one's power,\" Bentley said. \"A large, rotund body is in effect saying, 'I don't have to do manual labor' and 'I have enough food.' \"By the post-World War II era, the American population began to suffer health conditions that are associated with the overindulgence of food, such as heart disease and hypertension.\"Right around the World War II period, you get more concerns about health, and that is somewhat reflected in the presidency,\" Bentley said. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, suffered a heart attack in 1955.

{"_id":"The question 7 billion people are asking: How do you deal with Donald Trump?","articleText":"Michael D'Antonio, the author of \"The Truth About Trump,\" is writing Trump Watch, a series of columns on President-elect Donald Trump for CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Before his election, the closest Donald Trump got to the presidency was on an episode of \"The Simpsons\" television show, which forecast a dystopian future when he would occupy the Oval Office. Now, he is the president-elect, due to occupy the most powerful job in the world beginning January 20.  Trump may be the most unconventional and perhaps the most controversial man ever elected to the White House. Since he's someone whose policy positions and style are completely different from the presidents of recent decades and is known for his unpredictability, his election presents the nearly seven billion people who share the planet with him with a most difficult question: How do you deal with Donald Trump?Trump has long vexed those who would work with him, compete against him or even seek to understand him.  On a personal level, his first wife Ivana, who has known him for forty years, told me that even after raising three children with Trump she doesn't \"get him\" at all. His critics in business and politics have complained that Trump changes direction so often it's hard to get a reliable fix on him.  He nevertheless made a success of his third marriage and despite bankruptcies, he's always found new partners for his ventures.   A wild card dealt to foreign leadersConfronted with a president who has the thinnest resume in history -- no record in government, the military, or any other form of public service -- world leaders are already straining to adapt to Trump's improvisational style. The president elect hasn't waited for briefings from the State Department, which typically helps incoming presidents.  And he hasn't shown much interest in diplomatic tradition.  Instead he has made a flurry of calls to other heads of state and received incoming contacts like a short order cook -- first come, first served.    Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull swerved around the usual protocol for contacts with America's closest allies -- the United Kingdom usually comes first -- and reached Trump by dialing a phone number he got from pro golfer Greg Norman.  Just as remarkable is that fact that instead of waiting to hear congratulations from abroad, it was Trump who started calling presidents and prime ministers. Ireland's Prime Minister Enda Kenny was the first European leader he spoke to, apparently because his adviser Rudolph Giuliani is well connected to the Irish Consulate in New York.Any world leader wondering about how to connect with Trump should take a hint from Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who jetted to New York from meetings in Peru in order to speak with the President-elect directly.  Abe is no doubt aware of Trump's past record of Japan-bashing -- before he attacked China's trade practices Trump made the Japanese the enemy -- but he has not made a public issue out of this history or Trump's suggestion, during the campaign, that Japan pay more for the defenses provided by the United States military and, perhaps, acquire nuclear weapons.        A lifelong salesman who values the personal touch, Trump is unafraid to negotiate on an impromptu basis and prefers to meet with people face-to-face or speak to them on the phone (He does not enjoy reading long memos or proposals). If Abe pointed out that he has already increased (modestly) Japan's defense spending and that his country can be a counterweight against China, Trump will be impressed.        The political is personalWhether he was acting on the basis of intuition, or research into Trump's modus operandi, Abe was right to use the idea that he was in the neighborhood, well, at least the hemisphere, to justify popping-in at Trump Tower. Always partial to the person who hustles ahead of others, Trump also believes that he is a great judge of human beings and that he can determine in an instant whether he's dealing with someone he can trust.  In my conversations with Trump, he criticized Barack Obama for failing to operate in the same way. He thought his predecessor should have met more frequently with members of Congress in order to cultivate productive relationships with them. Congressional leaders who would get along with Trump would do best to follow Abe's example and make the effort to spend time with the man. Representatives from states that profit by foreign trade -- Texas, New York, California, etc. -- would do well to tell Trump about it before he acts to make his campaign promises come true. The same goes for those who would like to protect as much of Obamacare as possible.  When Trump sat down with President Obama last week to discuss just what it is the president does -- he and his team have seemed unsteady on this matter -- he heard a pitch for keeping parts of it. Apparently persuaded, Trump soon said he'd like to keep certain popular provisions, like guaranteeing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.  Exasperating as it may be to learn that a man who ran for president by attacking Obamacare only now seems to understand it, Trump's change-of-heart speaks to the importance of making personal appeals in order to influence his politics. As a pragmatist who was a registered Democrat from 2001 to 2009, Trump is not a lifelong Republican, nor does he take consistently hard-right positions on issues. During the Republican Presidential Debate in Houston, he was criticized by opponents when he said government should make sure poor people get life-saving medical care. As Senator Ted Cruz sputtered, about this idea being tantamount to socialism Trump said, \"Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.\" It was hardly a hero's stand on behalf of the poor, but in a party that includes some anti-government extremists, it revealed Trump's comparative flexibility.  He can be co-opted It is the flexible, some would say equivocating, side of Trump that members of the House and Senate might seek out during the transition and when he assumes power. No one knows this better than New York Senator Charles \"Chuck\" Schumer, a Democrat who will be take the role of minority leader after Senator Harry Reid of Nevada retires.  Schumer, who has received campaign donations from Trump, has known him for decades. He has signaled that rather than oppose the new president on everything, as House Republicans determined to do when Obama was first elected, he will seek common ground on issues such as public works projects, paid maternity leave, and child tax credits.If they can make common cause with Trump on issues that matter to their own supporters, and, in their mind, to the United States as a whole, Democrats might be able to triangulate the Tea Party members of the GOP and others who are rigidly anti-spending and consider everything that Obama touched to be anathema.  For his part, Trump has always appreciated the value of leverage, in the form of the heavy debt he has sometimes placed on his companies. He won't be afraid of adding to the national debt if he believes the spending is an investment that will pay dividends in the form of eventual higher tax returns that one day can stanch the red ink. In the meantime, he would be able to goose the economy, especially if he slashes taxes, and create at least the impression that he's doing a good job for Middle America. Long a man who appreciates the appearance of success almost as much as success itself, Trump will gladly team with Democrats against hardliners in his party if the rewards are right.Fight when you must        Never inclined to leave anything on the table, Trump can be expected to push as hard as he can for his agenda. He is also willing to frighten everyone in sight if it gives him a tactical advantage. This may be why he gave one of the top positions in the White House to Steve Bannon, who was in charge of Breitbart.com, which has published anti-Semitic and misogynistic posts. Bannon is a leader of the so-called alt-right, which is regarded by large numbers of Republicans as well as Democrats as a dangerous white nationalist movement. Bannon's appointment could have been a sop to this tiny portion of the electorate or he could constitute a kind of human threat, poised to carry out the most extreme policies in the agenda Trump presented during the campaign.Perhaps the most extreme of these ideas is Trump's call for mass deportation of undocumented Mexican immigrants, many of whom have lived many years in the U.S. and have deep roots in local communities.  Others that lurk outside the realm of decency, and perhaps the law, include a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump has, himself, backed away at least in part from these ideas. However Bannon's appointment may indicate otherwise. Should Trump light a match and turn toward the most divisive policy proposals of the campaign, either because he believes they are right for the country or that they make for good politics, opponents must consider themselves to be swimmers confronted by a menacing shark. If all else fails, punch him in the nose. Although Trump says he never backs down, of course he sometimes does. Among the few publicly available records of Trump's past one can find accounts of lawsuits he has settled in order to end a conflict.  In one of the few that involved a public policy issue, Trump settled a claim the Justice department brought against the family business for racial discrimination against lease applicants by agreeing to change practices. Recently the New York Daily News reported that Trump is ready to settle the big fraud lawsuit filed against his so-called university in federal court.  (On Friday, Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits against Trump University.)Bring a celebrity, and shake his handAlthough Trump was once a renowned germophobe who avoided shaking hands, he is more or less over that little foible. In fact, he enjoys interacting with the stream of visitors who have trekked to Trump Tower over the years and has always considered himself the kind of man who keeps his word, especially when a handshake is involved. A good example is the story he tells about how he negotiated the deal for his TV show \"The Apprentice.\" As he explained to me, the entire arrangement was worked out in a single face-to-face meeting with producer Mark Burnett. The result was a lucrative arrangement for both men, which endured for more than a decade and brought Trump into millions of American living rooms.     For members of Congress, foreign diplomats and other leaders who must deal with Trump, face-to-face negotiation concluded with a look-him-in-the-eye handshake will be essential. Trump revels in duels that involve cagey lawyers and complex contracts, and always looks for escape clauses that let him do whatever he wants. However, he also fancies himself a man who keeps the promises he makes.Finally, it's noteworthy that in a frenzied week of serious challenges, Trump nevertheless took time to interact with a world-renowned boxer, a TV judge, a pro skateboarder, and television host Piers Morgan. Always inclined to bask in the glow of other famous people, Trump apparently retains his fascination with celebrities. Anyone who seeks an audience, and influence with him would do well to bring one along.

{"_id":"The rise of romance gaming: is the perfect boyfriend inside your phone?","articleText":" (CNN)When Ayumi Saito was 22 she broke up with her boyfriend.But the Tokyo resident found an easy way to fill the void left by her ex lover's departure.She downloaded a romance gaming app onto her phone, and became one of the millions of women in Japan to swap real life intimacy for a fantasy.\"I felt lonely,\" says Ito, now 31. \"Japanese men are shy and not good at flattering women. But girls want to hear 'I love you'.\"The virtual boyfriends she found in games like \"Metro PD: Close To You\" -- which sees a female detective discover a life-changing romance while fighting crime -- did all the things her former partner hadn't.\"When I was tired at the end of the day, before going to sleep, I was so relieved to hear his sweet and gentle words,\" she tells CNN.Saito is by no means unusual.In 2014, the romance gaming industry in Japan was worth $130 million.In a society where 44.2% of women -- almost half of Japan's millennial singles aged between 18 and 34 -- are virgins, this industry has seemingly tapped into a deep desire for simulated intimacy in Japan.The birth of romance gamingDating simulation apps first appeared in Japan in the 1980s. Known as \"bishoujo\" they would generally focus on a male protagonist pursuing pretty anime-style female characters.In 1994, a team of female coders at Japanese gaming company Koei broke with tradition, launching the first romance game for women, \"Angelique\". Based on the quest of a blonde teenage girl, who is a candidate to be the next \"Queen of the Universe\", to choose her perfect suitor, it was wildly successful.Japanese businesswoman Nigahi Higashi and her husband, Yuzi Tsutani, saw a niche in this lucrative sector. Japan has the third largest mobile gaming market in the world, generating $6.5 billion of sales in 2016, according to the Global Games Market Report. So, in the mid-2000s the duo pivoted their punk gaming business, Voltage, to cater to the female audience, debuting their first dating app for women \"My Lover is The No.1 Host\" in 2006.  \"Almost all women are under stress,\" says Higashi. \"We wanted to provide something for them.\"  That proved to be an excellent business strategy. Today, Voltage is a world leader in female romance simulation apps, catering to female \"otaku\" -- intense fans of popular culture, such as anime and manga -- and other curious women. It offers 88 romance titles, says its games have been played by 50 million (mostly female) users globally and, in the year leading up to June 2016, the company made ¥11.2 billion ($102 million), having also released English versions of some of its apps in the United States and Europe.\"It doesn't matter what your type of male would be, you'll find a man that you'll really like (in these games),\" says Kukhee Choo, assistant professor of comparative culture at Sophia University, in Tokyo.\"And, of course, that male is going to be perfect. \"The perfect boyfriend.\" Twelve samurai suitors\"Samurai Love Ballad\" is one of Voltage's most popular apps.More of a \"choose your own path\" manga novel than a typical mobile phone game like Candy Crush, for example, (all romance apps are presented as stories, in chapters), it immerses the user in the war-torn Sengoku Era (1467 to 1603), where the waitress protagonist has to runaway to save her brother's life, and conveniently meets 12 potential samurai suitors along the way.   \"What's unique about the female romance genre is that there are so many men in each game,\" says Choo, noting that few female  characters aside from the protagonist are introduced.Several times per chapter, the user must choose from a list of \"love tactics\" detailing how she could interact with these men, the goal being to achieve greater intimacy with the preferred samurai -- who normally sends mixed signals to keep the heroine keen.\"The strong and selfish men are the most popular,\" says Higashi. \"The most popular characters are strong on the outside and only sometimes sweet for you.\"In Japan this type of suitor is called the \"tsundere\" -- literally: \"hot-cold\" -- man. For North America audiences, Voltage tweaks the formula, as it says women there want a \"macho man, both mentally and physically\".When love makes moneyBroadly speaking, there are two business models for the romance apps.The \"personal\" genre works on a fremium model, meaning they are free to download, but after reading the \"prologue\" users must pay about $45 to download the subsequent 13 or so chapters. Paying for the epilogue often brings an extra layer of romance: simulated sex scenes are a common feature.  The \"social\" games, meanwhile, give away five or so chapters free per day, but users must pay extra to advance in the story, and to purchase add-ons such as clothes and make-up that will make them more attractive to their suitors.There are other extras, too.\"You actually can receive an email from your love in some games,\" says Higashi. \"It'll say, 'Don't forget the date tomorrow night', and if you register your with name, he'll include that, too.\"Sweet fantasy?While other countries also have a romance gaming app culture -- in the United States, for example, gaming producer Cheritz is a leader in the market -- the craze has taken off in Japan at an unprecedented pace.Choo believes the industry's success is down to underlying social issues.\"As a society as a whole, there is a sense of alienation in the urban setting,\" she tells CNN. \"A lot of people feel they're not connected to their peers.\"A  government survey released in 2015 in Japan found that nearly 40% of single people in their 20s and 30s did not want a romantic partner, in real life at least. Yuirka, 26 -- who asked CNN not to use her full name -- lives in Tokyo and began playing romance games when she turned 20. She is currently single in real life.\"These romance games make me feel I want to be in love with someone,\" she tells CNN. \"The boys in these games have something lacking in the real life boys -- they are so sweet.\"Does she worry spending her time living out romantic fantasies means the real thing won't live up to expectations?\"I know that it is a game,\" she says. \"A boyfriend in a romance game cannot be a substitute for a real boyfriend.\"Physical transformation Choo, however, believes the fantasy being sold in romance games is shaping some girls' expectations in real life, especially in \"host clubs\" -- bars and cafes where men are employed to lavish attention on female customers.\"For the host club men, it's their job to be consumed by women,\" says Choo. \"Some of these female players go to host clubs and order hosts like they're playing a game. They will choose males likes characters.\"Choo believes there is a \"physical transformation\" taking in place in these clubs, as men working there try to look \"closer to 2D characters\", who are typically drawn as boy band-esqe \"pretty boys\". For now, at least, there are no official statistics to prove a direct correlation between using such games and being single, or that romance games are steering the image of Japanese men.Higashi says that with more of Japanese society opting for life alone, and shunning intimacy, romance gaming could be a harmless substitute.\"It is true some of our users are probably scared to be in love in real life and enjoy the virtual romance,\" she says.\"I think our desire to love and be loved by someone is universal. We'll continue to provide a good service for the women who want such a feeling around the world.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/asia/romance-gaming-japan/index.html"}
{"_id":"The rising star in the world of architecture","articleText":" (CNN)It used to be that Ghanaians that wanted to study architecture picked a school in Europe or the United States. Returning, they'd bring foreign techniques, import foreign materials, and create foreign buildings, mainly in the Bauhaus style that dominated thrifty post-war Europe. \"Functional, buildable and economical,\" is how Akosua Obeng, a Ghanaian architect at Orthner, Orthner & Associates, describes the style. \"Which is not a bad thing,\" she adds. \"It's just that creativity maybe sometimes suffers.\"Concrete may still dominate as a building material, but construction trends are changing in Accra, Ghana's capital. Now, local architects are just as likely to study from within their home country.

One major change is the resurgence of wood -- mirroring a Western trend, but from distinctly Ghanaian roots.\"Wood is actually our material... we are in the forest belt,\" Obeng explains. \"Wood is in abundance (and) we are known as a timber exporter. But the weird thing is that the knowledge to build in wood has disappeared,\" she says. \"From the colonial times we started building with concrete and block work... we just don't known how to do it any more.\"By designing wooden structures, Obeng is reviving these lost skills. On one of her projects -- a block of townhouses with a wooden facade -- the architect has drafted in a retired German woodworker who Obeng says is \"helping the locals and passing on the knowledge, bringing us back our wood knowledge.\"\"Many people think building a house with wood is impossible,\" says timber construction supervisor Latif Falicu. \"This building has changed the architectural thinking of Ghana.\"Read more: Do these buildings represent freedom?Meanwhile other architects are taking \"home grown\" literally.

It's also providing insulation for the roof at the same time... it's just amazing.\"Economical and sustainable, these techniques, from urban greening to building with wood, are not without purpose.\"This is what we want our young architects to design with,\" Obeng argues. \"This is what tropical architecture is all about!\" ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/africa/ghana-young-architects/index.html"}
{"_id":"The teenage refugees selling sex on Athens streets ","articleText":" (CNN)In the heart of Athens, sidewalks teem with passersby, restaurants are packed with people and crowds flow from the metro.But take a few steps into nearby Victoria Square, and you'll find a shocking world of survival sex and exploitation.The sex trade has always existed here, but it's now exacerbated by a swelling number of refugees arriving from the Middle East.Caught in that web of desperation are unaccompanied minors -- many of them teenage boys. How it works It starts with eye contact, a seemingly benign hello, or a request for a cigarette.On one bench an older man rubs the shoulders of a young refugee. Others troll the square in small groups scoping out their options.\"It's a game,\" explains social worker Tassos Smetopoulos.\"There are older guys that just offer accommodation, food, clothes. But of course the minors want money. That's the idea: To find money to go illegally to central Europe.\"HookedOne of those seeking an escape is Ali (not his real name), a 17-year-old from Afghanistan. He came to Europe hoping to get an education and eventually bring his mother over to join him.He arrived in Greece alone, with €270 ($286) to his name, no place to stay and found himself in an environment rife with drugs and prostitution. Now, dependent on drugs and money from clients, the reality of what his life has become is overwhelming.\"I told myself, 'look at yourself, you came to Europe, what was your aim?'\" He says. \"I am not doing this because I like it. \"If I wanted to do something I like, I would date a girl. [But] because I don't have the money I don't have a choice.\"READ: Three generations of refugees on today's crisisLike many of his friends, Ali regularly heads to the sprawling park nearby, where deals are usually made with local men, ranging from €5 to €12 ($5.50 to $13). \"Some offer €3, some 100, some 80. But I don't go with anyone for less than €60,\" he explains. 'It doesn't get easier'In the clearings off the pathways, dozens of condom wrappers litter the ground.\"At the end of the day when you go inside the park, they come, some pull their pants down so you see their ass,\" Ali says.\"Some come to you, talk to you and show you their money, it works like this.\"Ali says some of the older men offer to take the boys to a local disco and back to their homes.READ: Thousands flee fire at refugee camp in GreeceHe has been prostituting himself every other day for the past three or four weeks -- the money and an opportunity of a warm bed too good to turn down.\"Some will take you home, give you clothes and anything you like,\" he says.\"They will treat you like their husband, their boyfriend, they will give you €200, €300, €400.\"It's very hard. How can a person be with another man like that? Those men are sick. No matter how often I do it, it doesn't get easier.\"Clinging to hopeMany of the refugees cling to the promises of smugglers, who also roam the park, that with enough money they can get to western Europe illegally and declare asylum there.\"It's shocking for us, for me, for you,\" said Tassos.\"But for them [sex clients and smugglers] it's like new meat. With people who are desperate, it's very easy to abuse them.\"Why now?The seeming rise in unaccompanied minors prostituting themselves comes after a \"one-for-one\" deal brokered between the EU and Turkey in March.The agreement stipulated that Turkey would accept back migrants who had crossed its borders into Greece, while the EU would resettle refugees directly from Turkey. But the deal effectively froze refugees in place, leaving tens of thousands stranded in Greece, a country still unable to adequately accommodate them.Among those still waiting for shelter are around 1,200 unaccompanied minors, according to the Greek government -- but in reality the number is likely much higher.Many refugees have not registered with authorities for fear of being sent back home after struggling to get this far as the EU has declared countries like Afghanistan \"safe.\"What is being done?Greek police said in a statement that they had not had any reports of unaccompanied minors involved in the sex trade in the two specific areas we visited, but added they were aware of the problem and working to address it.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also said in a statement that authorities should make sure minors are protected.Read more: Meet Eida -- the 115-year-old refugee with one remaining wishIn the meantime, desperate teenagers like Ali continue to \"do this job,\" despite the humiliation.He willingly answers all of our questions, but when we ask about his mother, and wonder if he will ever tell his family what he is going through, he tears up.\"I am ready to cry,\" he says. \"I don't want to speak about my mother.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/europe/refugees-prostitution-teenagers-athens-greece/index.html"}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Two weeks into his transition from President-elect to America's commander in chief, Donald Trump has signaled his priorities and demonstrated the habits of mind he will bring to the most powerful position in the world.  The clues tell us we shouldn't expect this 70-year-old showman to be transformed into a genuinely sober, predictable leader, but this is not necessarily a bad omen.There are lots of things ordinary politicians care about -- rules about what kinds of things can be said while in office or on the campaign trail, traditions that have been tested in the history of US government and politics -- that Trump may not care about. But it's clear from his career and evident from his period as President-elect so far that there are three things he does care about:   He still cares about the media -- a lot.Trump has attended two big gatherings in the days since he seized the presidency.  Neither of these sessions brought him together with the campaign staff that served him so well or a large group of men and women who might serve in his administration. Instead Trump chose to spend hours with the key leaders of the major TV news networks and the writers and editors of The New York Times.The sessions with journalists tell us that Trump remains all-but-obsessed with the power of the news media.  His stagecraft was vintage Trump.  The TV news folks were required to troop to his domain, Trump Tower, where they were photographed like supplicants coming to honor the monarch seated high in the sky above them.  Instead of the \"reset\" of a relationship described by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Trump apparently used much of the meeting as a platform of complaint against organizations such as CNN and NBC.The New York Post reported the encounter as a full-on conflict, but CNN's Brian Stelter wrote that Trump also asked for a positive relationship between his White House and the media.

{"_id":"The villain in your fridge: 5 ways to avoid food poisoning ","articleText":"Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN)Most people have experienced that unfortunate feeling in their gut making them run in search of the nearest bathroom. The cause was most likely a delicious meal the previous day -- now deeply regretted in hindsight.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48 million Americans -- 1 in 6 people -- get sick from foodborne illnesses each year, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3000 dying from consuming contaminated food. In reality, the numbers are likely to be much higher as most people don't visit their doctor due to bouts of diarrhea -- they instead prefer to suffer in silence.But if people become complacent with their eating and hygiene habits, the number of infections will go up courtesy of multiple bacteria growing wildly in foods before they're eaten. We've put together six common sense ways to avoid food poisoning and the key bacteria behind it -- a crib sheet to keep to hand in the kitchen. 1) Don't leave your food outFood left out at room temperature for hours at a time -- be it at home, a cookout (barbeque), a party, or a restaurant buffet -- is a prime source of food poisoning. The spores and toxins released by bacteria commonly found on food can flourish at this temperature.\"[The spores] thrive in the 'danger zone' of 40-140 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 60 degrees Celsius),\" says Gabrielle Judd, a registered dietician with the University of Maryland Medical Center. Judd works with transplant patients whose reduced immunity puts them at greater risk from infections -- increasing the importance of them eating wisely.The main spore-producing bacteria are Clostridium perfringens -- among the most common causes of food poisoning in the United States. Another culprit multiplying and producing toxins at room temperature is Bacillus, found commonly in rice, soups, sauces and leftovers.Judd refers to these bugs as \"cookout bugs\" as this is a typical situation where food is prepared and left out for hours at a time.  \"Food should not be out for more than two hours at a time,\" she says.On the plus side, infections with these bacteria are unlikely to hospitalize you, but instead leave you poorly for 24 hours. For this same reason, cases of illness often go unreported.So as spring approaches and brings with it potential for weekend cookouts, don't forget to use your refrigerator.2) Be wary of raw poultry\"At least half of all raw chicken carcasses carry significant levels of campylobacter,\" says bacteriologist Andrew Roe from the University of Glasgow, who states more than 500,000 cases of food poisoning in the U.K. are caused by these chicken-loving bacteria. This group of bacteria cause the majority of foodborne infections in the developed world as the bacteria are prevalent in the food chain itself. \"Four out of five cases [of food poisoning] are from contaminated poultry,\" says Roe. Poultry expands beyond chicken, with infection also common in other commonly consumed birds with which people may be less vigilant in terms of hygiene.\"Turkey and duck are often highly contaminated with Campylobacter so the advice would be to treat them exactly as you would chicken,\" says Roe.Judd adds that  \"food borne illness likely comes from improper thawing/preparation of meats.\" Luckily, infection is usually self-controlling, meaning people don't get severely ill but instead recover over time. This low harm associated with infections is why the bacteria are not prioritized for removal from the food chain -- unlike salmonella which chickens in the UK are now all vaccinated against.The solution? Wash your hands when handling poultry, avoid contaminating surfaces and thoroughly cook your meat. Basically, avoid any risk of raw meat entering your body.\"The best way to avoid infection is to make sure all chicken is cooked thoroughly [and] you have good kitchen practices,\" says Roe.3) Learn the perils of minced meatsChicken is not the only villain among the animal kingdom.Roe advises to step away from your burger if there is any suspicion about its status as cooked -- minced meat can be a potent source of infection. \"Mince products are inherently more risky,\" says Roe. The danger lies in the grinding together of meat -- and the increased likelihood of surface bacteria mixing deep into your meat -- unlike with a piece of steak.\"A steak is an intact piece of meat. Any contamination will be on the surface,\" says Roe. Cooking a steak well on the outside therefore reduces your chances of infection, even if it remains rare inside. But with minced meat the bacteria are mixed into the blend. This applies to any form of burger, be it gourmet or a simple slider handed out as a canapé. \"With ground meat the outside mixes up with all the meat and contaminates the rest,\" agrees Judd.Burgers -- a cook-out favourite -- combined with the uncontrolled heat of a barbeque through intense, uncontrolled, flames bring a high risk of being cooked on the outside, but raw in the middle.\"People can be quite flippant, but these are the times you're increasing your risk,\" says Roe.The solution? If you love your burgers, make sure you eat them well-done.\"Be prepared to reject food if not cooked thoroughly,\" says Roe4) Don't forget to wash your fruitThe first thoughts when assigning blame to a bout of food poisoning commonly go towards meat and poultry, but your fruits and vegetables aren't as safe as you think.A 2013 study by the CDC found that 46% of foodborne illnesses in the U.S are caused by fruits, vegetables and nuts. Leafy vegetables were found to cause the most illness, accounting for 22% of all cases in the study -- aided by the fact that bacteria, like E. coli, can live within the leaf tissue itself.\"There's less perceived risk [with fruits and vegetables] so people are more blasé,\" says Roe.Many forms of bacteria are found naturally on the surfaces -- or skins -- of fruits and vegetables which need washing off before consumption. If not, that slice down the middle can bring those surface bacteria deep down inside the fruit. Judd advises the same rules be applied to all foods with outer skins or rinds -- such as oranges, watermelons or cucumbers. \"Most people wash off an apple but with melons assume they don't have to,\" says Judd.When cutting or peeling such foods, bacteria on the surface can easily spread inside. \"If peeled and washed thoroughly you can reduce your risk quite significantly,\" adds Roe.5) Reheat your leftovers properlyThe risk of reheating rice is a common myth propagated as a means of food poisoning -- linked with bacillus bacteria found commonly in paddy fields and likely to be present in those rice grains.The bacteria are killed when the rice is cooked, but their spores stay alive and flourish if then left out at room temperature. \"The spores grow back into bacteria,\" says Roe.The solution? Rice should be steaming hot when reheated, to ensure any returning bacteria have died.These rules apply for reheated food in general to prevent any new bacteria from thriving -- both on your food and in your intestine. \"Illness comes from improper management of leftovers,\" says Judd who also advises not to keep leftovers for more than 3 to 4 days. \"If you're served something that's inadequately hot...be brave enough to say you're not happy with it,\" says Roe.Have you got the (healthy) guts to make a stand?","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/health/five-ways-to-avoid-food-poisoning/index.html"}

{"_id":"The year of living thankfully","articleText":"This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan. Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here. (CNN)Logically speaking, we should be in a perpetual state of gratitude. Most people who read this column, even if they aren't fully aware, have a long list of blessings to count (most of the time, anyway). Family. Friends. Love. Health. Freedom from war and natural disaster. Imagination. Community. A roof over our heads. Common decency. Hope. Opportunity. Memories. Financial stability. Favorite places. Days off work. Good weather. The golden age of television. Books. Music. Ice cream. Weekends. A friendly exchange. Something good that happened today. Something bad that didn't happen today. A good cup of coffee.You may not have everything you want or even need, but that probably leaves buckets -- nay, container ships -- full of tangible and conceptual items for which to be grateful. Things can always be better, but they can always be worse. It often depends on how you look at that proverbial glass of water.To get in better touch with gratefulness, all you have to do is find easy ways to count blessings more often than, say, over an annual turkey dinner. Keep them boiling on the front burner of your mind, and you increase your appreciation of life. What keeps us from longer and more frequent visits to a grateful (and graceful) mental place is that we think about other things. In fact, we are wired to. Our primitive brains smartly evolved the capacity to quickly sense potential threats, to keep us safe. But in a post-saber-toothed-tiger era, we get easily annoyed, worried and distracted by a lot of extraneous noise. Instead, we need more focus on the positive, And you don't have to set the bar high. Allow yourself to be thankful for the small, mundane things that give you joy and meaning, as well as the big ones. And don't try to gather heaps of blessings to count; a handful each day should do it. In his play \"Two Trains Running,\" August Wilson wrote, \"You walking around here with a ten-gallon bucket. Somebody put a little cupful in and you get mad 'cause it's empty. You can't go through life carrying a ten-gallon bucket. Get you a little cup. That's all you need. Get you a little cup and somebody put a bit in and it's half-full.\" Here are some low-threshold habits and traditions to institute that will fill that little cup right up. And a number of reasons you should bother to do so.Thanks to be healthyThe most obvious reason to boost your gratitude is that it's closely tied to increased feelings of happiness. The studies backing that up are not surprising. What's remarkable is that scientists who have located thoughts of gratitude in the brain found that not only do they produce feelings of pleasure, they stimulate areas regulating stress. This makes intuitive sense. Be more aware of what you feel is good in your life, and you will feel good. Also, if you're sufficiently grateful, you're less likely to compare yourself to others, which is often the enemy of happiness. Resilience, including the ability to cope with stress and trauma, is another trait correlated with gratitude. Studies have showed that counting blessings was a factor in managing post-traumatic stress for Vietnam War veterans and an effective coping strategy for many after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Other research shows that the more grateful you are, the more you are likely to exhibit patience and self-control. It can even be good for marriages and relationships: Couples good at exhibiting thankfulness tend to be \"more committed and more likely to remain in their relationships over time.\" Our best selves, it seems, are our most grateful selves.Studies have showed that gratitude can indirectly influence physical health, as well. Those who have \"dispositional gratitude\" -- defined by one study as \"part of a wider life orientation towards noticing and appreciating the positive in the world\" -- are more likely to report good physical health, a propensity for healthy activities and willingness to seek help for health concerns. In another study, New York teenagers who rated as the most grateful in their class -- defined by \"having a disposition and moods that enabled them to respond positively to the good people and things in their lives\" -- were less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. The benefits of having more gratitude also correlated with benefits to the heart among patients who had experienced heart failure. Being grateful can even get you a better night's sleep. According to one study involving college students who instituted various methods for increasing gratitude, such as a gratitude journal, they worried less at bedtime and slept longer and better. In another study, adults in the UK (40% of whom had sleep disorders), reported that thinking about what they are grateful for at night led to falling asleep faster and staying asleep longer. Convinced? Let's get to the fun part.How to up your GQ (gratefulness quotient)I'm currently conducting two completely unscientific thankfullness-boosting experiments. For nearly two years, I've been keeping a gratitude journal. And for the last five years or so, my family has engaged in a dinnertime ritual called \"Roses, Thorns & Buds\" that surfaces the same details.A lot has been written about these and other thankfulness experiments, and it should be noted that there are no rules or even standards that govern them. We're in very, very soft science territory here. But reliable research does show that whatever you do to increase gratitude pays off, so it's worth it to find what is easy, enjoyable and effective for you.A gratitude journal need not be any more complicated than keeping a notebook by your bed and starting a nightly habit of jotting down who and what you were grateful for that day. Journaling was the standard method for some of the studies cited above, so this is a simple but effective option.I'm coming up on two years of trying this one, and I added a layer you may want to consider. After one year, I took the time to total up all the mentions. My wife and children were, predictably, at the top, reminding me not to take them for granted. But I was surprised to see that co-workers, neighbors and a city park all ranked highly. It was useful for me to review in that way, because when I see those people, I have this added layer of positive feeling about them at the forefront of my mind. It's hard to get annoyed by someone when you think, \"I'm so often grateful for that person.\"It was fun to play with the data, too. By category, \"family\" was the clear winner (1,011 instances) for me, followed by \"places\" (269 instances, with coffee shops being the biggest sub-category), \"friends\" (259), CNN \"co-workers\" (197) and \"experiences\" (133). Also, \"Star Wars\" (11) beat both beer (10) and books (8). It will be interesting to compare second-year totals against these. All of it is getting me closer to understanding and remembering what I'm most grateful for.Roses, Thorns & Buds (or RTB, among its devotees) has been part of so many family dinners since my older daughter was 4 years old that I've forgotten where we first heard about it. It's quite simple: Everyone at the table takes turns sharing \"roses,\" which are something positive and happy-making about their day; \"thorns,\" which are the opposite of that; and \"buds\" for something we're looking forward to and we anticipate will be a rose. Sometimes, the family meal and sharing these things itself is a rose.Granted, the \"thorn\" doesn't necessarily increase gratitude -- though it's still useful from a family discussion, empathy and problem-solving perspective. And if you can fix a problem, a rose may grow in that thorn's place. Here are our unscientific findings: Each time, we find that we have many roses and buds and usually only one thorn to share.   Friends have told us about effective variations on this technique, so one size doesn't fit all. If the metaphor is too flowery for you, pick another. Home runs, strikeouts and on deck? The important thing is to connect to the thankfulness in this way, whether you do it most evenings or on the occasional weekend. It's also an easy way for kids to get into a thankfulness habit themselves.Happiness jars, a strategy popularized by \"Eat, Pray, Love\" author Elizabeth Gilbert, is something of a hybrid of gratitude journal and RTB. The idea is to write down on a slip of paper the happiest moment of the day and drop it in a jar. The advantage of doing it this way is that in moments of unhappiness, you can reach into the jar and be reminded of those moments, perhaps becoming grateful for them anew. Gilbert was struck by how many of her fans shared photos of their decorated happiness jars (see Pinterest if you need inspiration) and by how her happiest moments are \"generally really common and quiet and unremarkable.\" And there are other experiments to try. You could set alarms/reminders on your phone to pause and think of something you are grateful for at different times of the day: Mornings help set the tone of the day, and reflecting while at work can be particularly useful. You can then record them on a gratitude journaling app.Or you could just focus on the simple act of saying thank you, and meaning it, more frequently. Writing letters of thanks (or emails if you want to be faster and more frequent) to those for whom you are grateful is worth doing with some regularity. You can also express gratitude with gifts, flowers and favors. Or simply make of list of all the things we take for granted but would be so unhappy to lose, such as job security, health, seeing loved ones. Review that list every week or so.Whatever way you start infusing your life with more moments of gratitude, in the short and long term, you will be grateful that you did.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/thankfulness-wisdom-project/index.html"}
{"_id":"There are 10 times more galaxies in our universe than we'd estimated","articleText":" (CNN)Turns out we were wrong; there aren't  200 billion galaxies in the universe. It's more like 2 trillion. Yes, TRILLION!That's the latest from NASA, which announced Thursday the number of galaxies in our observable universe is 10 times higher than previously projected. This revelation was possible, thanks to that font of discovery -- the Hubble Space Telescope. Astronomers have been trying to figure out the number of galaxies for decades.In the mid-1990s, they arrived at the 200 billion figure (again, thank you Hubble.) Arriving at the numberRecently, however, a team led by Christopher Conselice at the University of Nottingham in the U.K. decided to take another crack at it.It concluded that one point long, long, long ago, many of the galaxies were packed together. Some were tiny and faint and were swallowed by larger galaxies. As this happened, the population density of galaxies in space dwindled.  The team looked at old Hubble photos and newer images. Then, it used new mathematical models and inferred how many galaxies are out there that can't been by current telescopes.Its conclusion? More than 90 percent of the galaxies can't be seen by even our most powerful telescopes because they are too faint or too far away. \"It boggles the mind that over 90 percent of the galaxies in the universe have yet to be studied,\" Conselice said. There's good news: There's a bigger, badder telescope in the works. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to peer back to the dawn of time. It should be ready by the end of the year.

{"_id":"There's not enough 'care' in Tom Price's Obamacare alternative","articleText":"Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist. He is a medical analyst for NPR station WABE-FM 90.1 in Atlanta. He writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)You might remember President-elect Donald Trump telling us that he'd like to keep some parts of Obamacare. That was two weeks ago. With his announcement Tuesday that Rep. Tom Price,  R-Georgia, will be his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, any type of preservation is highly unlikely. Price is one of the law's archenemies. Seven years ago, during the heat of committee debates over the ACA, Price delivered a blistering speech condemning Democrats for an unwillingness to negotiate with him and other Republicans amid their harried push to get the Affordable Care Act through Congress. Price didn't have a fully articulated alternative back then, but he knew what he didn't like about Obamacare. \"What you all are planning is to increase drastically the intrusion of the federal government into the practice of medicine and the care of patients,\" he said. Of course Price was right. But we needed that \"intrusion\" of the federal government due to the crisis precipitated by the failures of medical professionals, the health care industry and the insurance industry to get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who had no access to care. Individual clinicians and hospitals may not be public utilities, but the system as a whole requires oversight to make sure it serves that function.   Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are by no means elegant solutions, but they get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who didn't have coverage before, and offer important new protections for everyone else. Price didn't just sit and fester over the years. He's got a plan now But it's not written with the uninsured and the poor at the forefront. No, the driving concept behind Price's Empowering Patients First Act is protecting the choices of patients who have money. If you have the money to shop around, you'll be able to choose from a broad national market of insurance plans. There's no mandate to buy insurance at all, unlike Obamacare, and if you do buy insurance, you can pick from a threadbare plan that's cheaper because it excludes large categories of care -- like maternity care, reproductive care, or rehabilitation, for example. Obamacare required holistic health insurance covering all the major categories of events that we know can happen to anyone. Price is also looking out for any well-to-do patients on Medicare who would like to be able to use Medicare dollars to offset more expensive fees from doctors and clinics who don't participate in Medicare. This rule change alone would rock health care by encouraging an exodus of providers out of Medicare's core cost-containment bargain: to treat Medicare patients, providers have always had to agree to take whatever reimbursement Medicare offers for the privilege of serving its beneficiaries.What about coverage for pre-existing conditions? Trump told \"60 Minutes\" and the Wall Street Journal he really liked that aspect of Obamacare, but for Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority. Price's plan will allow sick patients to stay in the regular market so long as they can keep paying their premiums.If a patient gets so sick she can't work to pay her premiums, insurers can jack up her rates 150%. If she becomes too poor to afford that, then she is relegated to high risk pools that will vary in quality state by state. These are small markets that need federal subsidies to work, and those subsidies are capped. If the high risk pools fill up, using up all its funds, then new patients simply can't enroll. Suddenly, \"Empowering Patients\" begins to look a lot more like \"Empowering Insurance Companies.\" Indeed, insurers can charge what they like for the one pre-existing condition we all may be so fortunate to develop: old age. As you get into the age brackets where you're more likely to need health care, you'll pay whatever insurers think the market can bear. Price wants our health care access to depend on how much competition we can foster between insurance companies to get new customers. In other highly regulated markets, like the airline industry, that concept isn't working out too well. Your only protection against those extra costs will be a capped tax deduction. In contrast to Price's efforts to empower insurance executives, I think Obamacare erred in large part by not regulating insurance companies even more tightly (the law could have forced them to participate in the exchanges to stay in business at all, for example). Price's law even acknowledges some insurance plans will have to come with an asterisk and a warning. \"This policy may be less expensive than others because it is not subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations\" of your home state, shoppers are told, and \"this policy is not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes\" of your home state.But all the skimpy plans Price could potentially offer would still be better than the void we had before Obamacare. It's my sincere hope that we won't see a repetition of the errors Democrats made while crafting the Affordable Care Act. Having experienced the other side of a legislative fiat, I hope that an HHS Secretary Price will bring Democrats to the table as he participates in crafting legislation behind the scenes with congressional Republicans. And everyone in Congress needs to keep in mind that the health care industry, particularly clinicians and hospitals, can only endure so much radical change within a short period. It certainly does no good if Republicans implement a whole new health care reform that will only be wiped away in a few years if the other party takes charge. To that end, the ideal course of action is revising Obamacare to inject more of the freedom and choice Republicans prioritize, both for patients and providers, while preserving and strengthening the law's requirements that insurance companies offer holistic coverage to everyone. But our toxic politics won't allow for such sensible, professional legislating. The best we can hope for from Price and his cohort are policies that manage to achieve the same ends in markedly different ways. I live in Price's district of northern Atlanta suburbs. The value of these suburbs as places to live comes not from their being 70% white. The value of Atlanta's suburbs comes entirely from their proximity to a more cosmopolitan urban center. We have to think of health care the same way, it can't work just for the rich. Indeed if anyone in Price's district has a serious enough injury, they'll go to a publicly funded hospital on the south side of downtown Atlanta, where the demographics are quite different. Price knows it well. Besides founding a private orthopedic practice that is now the largest in the state, he also spent time training orthopedic residents at Grady Memorial Hospital, the region's safety net. Hospitals like Grady do the work the private hospitals up north don't want to do. Grady would be a stronger institution if Georgia had expanded Medicaid as Obamacare intended, but Price even calls for taking that option away from other states who want to continue using the expansion. I don't know what Price experienced in his 25 years of medical practice that ever convinced him the average patient knows their future health care risks so well that saving money by shopping for skimpy plans is an important social good. I don't know why Price doesn't recognize the patients he once treated at Grady have enough struggles without worrying about how they're going to pay for health care. And I will never understand a fellow physician who's ever treated a gay or lesbian patient in distress who doesn't think everyone deserves to have a spouse by their side. Price is a smart man, and he's put something on the table that's better than nothing, but we need far more. So, I hope he'll heed his own cries from seven years ago and negotiate with the other side.

The study, part of the Gallup-Healthways State of American Well-Being Series, assigned an \"Active Living\" score to cities based on factors like walkability, bike-ability, the quality of the public transit system, and availability of well-maintained parks.

{"_id":"This artist creates incredible portraits on ice caps -- and then they disappear ","articleText":" (CNN)Surfer turned street artist Sean Yoro has created hauntingly beautiful portraits on icebergs in Iceland and remote waterside walls, navigating his aquatic locations on a paddle board. But his latest balancing act proved to be his most ambitious yet, as he braved the rapidly disappearing ice floes of the Canadian Arctic in his ongoing quest to raise awareness of the impacts of climate change.\"It was tricky because you can't see and there's some clear ice that I was bumping into while I was on my paddle board,\" says Yoro of his latest project, titled \"What if you Fly\". \"And there were definite close calls where I almost fell in, but I'm lucky to have grown up on a surf board, so I'm very comfortable in all types of situations which made it easier for me. Painting on iceYoro, who grew up in Hawaii and also goes by the name Hula, describes his fleeting works as a \"balance between nature and art\" and says his Hawaiian upbringing instilled in him the belief that it's his responsibility to take care of the environment. For \"What if you Fly\", Yoro teamed up with well known extreme wilderness photographer and filmmaker, Renan Ozturk to document his work and try to take his message to the \"younger generation.\"The photographer and artist spent two weeks in Nunavut, on Baffin Island in Canada, working with the locals to get to know their culture and local environmental issues. One girl that Ozturk photographed ended up being Yoro's muse. \"The portrait I painted was of a local Inuit girl that we had met up there, and she's spoken on climate change, which is what I love to get inspired by,\" says Yoro. But while choosing a subject was easy, finding the floating canvas for his art proved much harder, as the ice floes in the area were melting fast. \"Even the locals were saying how quickly the pack ice, which is the main ice that they usually hunt on for most of the year, was melting,\" says Yoro.\"Basically the week that we were there, probably 80% of the ice was gone. So when we were scouting for the smaller ice floes, it was very tricky. When testing how thick the ice was, some of the ice was cracking just while I was standing on it.\"Yoro finally settled on a piece of suitable ice and set to work creating the girl's image with paint. Although he said it was a quick process once they started, the ice eventually proved too fragile for the artist. \"With one head I painted she's kind of embracing the ice, lying on her back.

{"_id":"This pill could make your dog (and maybe you) live longer","articleText":" (CNN)See Momo.See Momo run.See Momo run faster, farther and with far more vigor, energy and youthfulness, his owners say, now that he's taking a drug meant for humans with cancer.\"It's been remarkable,\" Paola Anderson said as she watched Momo, her 13-year-old white Pomsky, run around the backyard, keeping up with dogs a third his age.The drug is called rapamycin. After nearly a decade of research showing that it makes mice live up to 60% longer, scientists are trying it out as an anti-aging drug in dogs and humans.Rapamycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago in soil collected from Easter Island in the South Pacific and studied in a Canadian lab, and it's the most promising drug to fight aging that Arlan Richardson has ever seen.A professor at the Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging, Richardson has been doing this kind of research for 40 years.\"It's the best bet we have,\" he said.Now, scientists are moving forward and testing the drug in dogs.Researchers at the University of Washington's Dog Aging Project gave rapamycin to 16 dogs and imaged their hearts.\"It started to function better. It started to look like a more youthful heart,\" said Matt Kaeberlein, co-director of the Dog Aging Project, who has presented this research at conferences but hasn't yet published it.Those dogs took rapamycin for only 10 weeks. Here's what happened to Momo and his \"brother,\" Sherman, who took it for much longer.Sherman and Momo's storyFor many years, Momo and Sherman were regular visitors to the Laguna Pet Spa in Laguna Hills, California, getting baths and haircuts.Then, on Christmas Eve 2010, their owner dropped them off and never came back.Anderson, who runs the spa, said she called the owner, but her phone had been disconnected.Anderson was horrified but not shocked. This was during Southern California's housing loan crisis, and this owner wasn't the first to abandon a dog to her care.But this was more than a foreclosure. Sherman was sick, very sick.On Christmas Day, the tiny 8-year-old Pomeranian was vomiting and howling in pain. Anderson rushed him to the emergency room. It was an attack of acute pancreatitis.Anderson nursed him back to health and became, in her words, \"mom\" to Sherman and Momo.The dogs had another mom, too: Anderson's partner, Sarah Godfrey, who was then living in Northern California but moved a few years later to Laguna Hills to live with Anderson and \"the boys.\"All was well until one day in May 2015, when Sherman fell over. He'd had a stroke.\"They gave him two weeks to live, unless he had surgery,\" Anderson remembers. Even with an operation, he had only a 20% chance of surviving.Anderson and Godfrey were wary of surgery for a fragile dog who was already 13 years old; that's equivalent to 68 years old for a human being, according to the American Kennel Club. Over the years, the couple had sought help from an herbalist for people problems, and now they desperately turned to him for help with their pooch problem. The herbalist did some research and came up with a possible treatment: rapamycin.Excited but also skeptical, Anderson and Godfrey went online and ran across Kaeberlein and the Aging Dog Project, which was recruiting canine subjects for the rapamycin research.They begged Kaeberlein to enroll Sherman, but the answer was no. Dogs had to be healthy and over 40 pounds. Sherman was neither.The couple calculated their next step.\"We knew we could go to Mexico and get rapamycin or order it online, but we wanted to be guided by a veterinarian, by a professional,\" Anderson said.That proved to tougher than they thought.Five vets refused to prescribe the drug. Finally, a sixth vet agreed to prescribe rapamycin, but only after consulting with Kaeberlein to determine the best dose for Sherman.By this point, a month after his stroke, Sherman was so weak, he had to be fed by hand and carried everywhere.But rapamycin changed all that, Anderson and Godfrey said.\"The third day after taking rapamycin, he could eat on his own. By the seventh day, he was walking on his own,\" Anderson said.Sixteen months later, the dog who had been given two months to live is still alive, and while clearly old, he's still active and able to run around the yard.That got the moms thinking about Momo. He wasn't sick like Sherman, but at 13, he was getting old and achy and losing stamina. The couple decided to try rapamycin on him, too.\"Why not have your dog live longer if you can?\" Godfrey said.She said that within days of taking the drug, Momo was able to run for hours, whereas before, just a 30-minute walk would tire him out. On a hot summer day when CNN visited, he was able to keep up with Anderson's parents' dogs, who are 4 and 5 years old.Anderson and Godfrey couldn't be happier.\"We call Sherman and Momo our rapamycin babies,\" Godfrey said.But there's a catchTake a look at the labels for Rapamune, made by Pfizer, and Afinitor (PDF), made by Novartis, two drugs that are essentially the same as rapamycin and are used to treat cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. The list of things that can go wrong is long and horrifying: cancer, diabetes, infections and more.\"You have to be concerned about these side effects,\" Kaeberlein said. But that hasn't stopped him from doing research on the drug.First, Kaeberlein thinks the side effects seen in cancer patients and transplant recipients might not be because of rapamycin per se but because those patients were very sick to begin with, because they were taking a whole host of other drugs as well, or both.Secondly, he uses a much lower dose of the drug on his healthy dogs compared with the dose used on sick people.Richardson, the aging expert at the University of Oklahoma, agrees with Kaeberlein. He's so convinced that he gave a low dose of rapamycin to his own dog, coincidentally named MoMo.MoMo had a heart problem, and Richardson said it stabilized after he started taking rapamycin. He said the Tibetan terrier looks and acts younger than his 14 years, which would be around 80 or 90 in human years.Plus, he said, there have been no side effects.\"We've been doing blood chemistries on her the whole time, and there's nothing bad,\" Richardson said.The researcher was quick to note that one dog's experience did not constitute proven scientific data -- but he added that he's given rapamycin to tiny monkeys called marmosets and hasn't see any negative side effects for them, either. But what about humans?Rapamycin has had very limited testing in healthy humans. Novartis gave rapamycin to 218 elderly volunteers, and it enhanced their response to the flu vaccine by 20%. The results \"raise the possibility that (rapamycin) may have beneficial effects\" on the decline in immune function that occurs naturally as we get older, the study authors wrote.They reported that the side effects of rapamycin were \"relatively well-tolerated.\" Severe side effects, they wrote, occurred at a \"similar\" rate as those experienced by the patients in the study who took a placebo, or a sugar pill.Of the 53 patients on the lowest dose of rapamycin, 22 suffered some side effect, most commonly mouth sores.Dr. Monica Mita, who's done her own research with drugs like rapamycin, said she thinks the side effects can be managed. \"It's really a matter of using the right dose and keeping an eye on the patients,\" said Mita, co-director of experimental therapeutics at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.The future of rapamycinKaeberlein, the professor of pathology at the University of Washington, is nervous about this article.He wants readers to know that Momo and Sherman's story is a tale of two dogs -- that's it -- and not scientific evidence in any way, shape or form, especially considering the placebo effect, meaning Momo and Sherman's owners might subconsciously be seeing what they want to see because they believe so much in rapamycin and fought so hard for it.He doesn't want Momo and Sherman's seeming success to \"encourage dog owners to go off to their veterinarians and demand rapamycin.\"And Kaeberlein, who's also president of the American Aging Association, is nervous for another reason, too.He dislikes the term \"anti-aging,\" as it conjures up images of snake oil salesmen peddling the fountain of youth.Instead, he prefers to think in terms of treatments that will delay the onset of diseases of aging, such as dementia or heart disease. In mice, rapamycin has been shown to slow these two types of declines, as well as several others.Over the next year, Kaeberlein will be studying rapamycin in a much larger group of dogs: about 150, compared with the 16 he studied earlier.He said other groups are looking at doing more aging studies in rapamycin in humans, too.It's been a long journey for the compound discovered more than half a century ago in the dirt of a South Pacific island.\"The rapamycin story is one of the most surprising, enticing, satisfying and unique stories in the history of medicine,\" Mita wrote in a medical journal five years ago. \"And the end is not near.\" CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/health/rapamycin-dog-live-longer/index.html"}
{"_id":"Thunderstorm asthma: 8 dead in Australia from freak illness","articleText":" (CNN)A freak illness known as thunderstorm asthma has now killed at least eight people in Australia. Thousands were hospitalized in Melbourne and other parts of Victoria last Monday with breathing problems due to a rare combination of weather and pollen.Eight days later, seven people are still receiving hospital treatment, including one who is in a critical condition, according to the Victoria Department of Health and Human Services. Thunderstorm asthma occurs when a storm hits during a period of unusually high pollen and high humidity, causing the grains to break up and disperse, entering people's lungs and making it hard for them to breathe. In a survey by the University of Melbourne, 74% of respondents said they experienced an asthma attack during the storm last week. Health emergencyThough grass pollen is the most common known cause of thunderstorm asthma, attacks can also be triggered by excessive levels of tree pollen and fungal spores in the atmosphere. \"This will vary by geography,\" said Aziz Sheikh, Professor of Primary Care Research and Development at the University of Edinburgh, adding that pollen from olive trees, for example, was reported in a previous thunderstorm asthma event in Italy in 2010.Levels of fungal spores in the atmosphere typically peak during harvest, which can also be drawn up and broken down during large thunderstorms due to the rise in atmospheric pressure, according to Sheikh.An official review is currently underway into how Victoria's state emergency services and health system responded to the thunderstorm asthma emergency. An extra 60 ambulances had to be deployed as more than 1,900 calls flooded emergency lines in four hours, or one call every four to five seconds. What can be done?While thunderstorm asthma has occurred all over the world in different conditions, there are persistent factors, according to Reena Ghildyal, an expert in biomedical sciences at the University of Canberra. \"There are many common threads in all reports of thunderstorm-related asthma -- a high concentration of potentially allergenic material such as that in late spring in Melbourne (pollen grains or fungi), a thunderstorm that sweeps up the allergens, which burst when wet and release very small particles (such as starch granules or fungal spores),\" she wrote last week. People with pre-existing asthma are particularly at risk of complications from thunderstorm asthma, and should therefore take necessary precautions.\"Keep updated on local pollen counts and weather forecasts, especially in spring; keep your asthma medication up to date; enjoy the spectacle of the thunderstorm from inside your house; and call (emergency services) if your asthma worsens or you feel any breathing difficulty,\" she said.

{"_id":"Tokyo wakes up to first November snow in over 50 years","articleText":" (CNN)Winter arrived early in Tokyo this year as the Japanese capital woke up to snowfall in November for the first time in over five decades.An unusually cold air mass passing over the city pushed temperature down 10 degrees Celsius overnight -- from an average of 11°C (50°F) to 1°C (34 °F).The Japan Meteorological Agency said it was the first time snow had fallen in November in central Tokyo since 1962, according to NHK, the country's national broadcaster.Surprised city dwellers shared pictures and videos of  the rare weather on social media.Instagram user Chloe Chia filmed her Tokyo window view excited by the unseasonal snow. \"Wet, fat, snowflakes\"But the above freezing temperatures in central Tokyo made the icy flakes melt slightly upon falling on the ground, adding more moisture and creating heavy, wet snow. Robert Speta, a meteorologist from NHK's World service, described the weathers as a downpour of \"wet, fat, snowflakes\" that stuck to people's clothes. But while the snow's consistency made it harder to accumulate, it did pile up on some pavements and cars. Another first, as Tokyo never saw snow building up in November since records started to be taken in 1875.The country's weather agency issued warnings of possible icy roads and snow on electric wires.\"It's making for some slick driving conditions. That's why in some trains you're seeing a lot of delays,\" said Robert Speta. Train delays had the most impactThe Japan Times reported that some people have slipped on snowy roads and suffered fractured bones thanks to the slippery surfaces. But Kahoru Yuki, a photographer and freelance journalist in Tokyo, told CNN that issues with transportation were city dwellers' main concern. \"There were some injuries, especially with the elderly. But for most people the train delays had the biggest impact,\" Kahoru Yuki told CNN.Train and subway services were delayed in some areas during the morning rush hour.Despite the setbacks, Kahoru could not  help taking a picture of ice flakes gathering over leaves, describing the effect as \"ice flowers\" blooming in the capital. Snow will not stay for long But while Tokyo's first snowfall -- known as  \"hatsuyuki\" -- arrived earlier this year, it will not stay for long. As the cold air mass leaves Japan, the weather experts from NHK said sunnier conditions would prevail through Friday.  It may be another 50 years until Tokyo sees snow in November again.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/world/tokyo-snow-japan-november-early/index.html"}
{"_id":"Too much heat in the kitchen may increase your risk of heart disease","articleText":" (CNN)If you're a fan of a well-seared steak or a crisp fried samosa, you may need to pace yourself, as a new study has found that you could be increasing your risk of heart disease.Like the crunch of something double-fried? That's even worse.This may not seem like new insight, as we all know to steer clear of deep-fried and oily foods because the extra oil is bad for our hearts (as well as our waistlines). But this new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nutrition, shows that it may be the temperature we're cooking our food at that's the real problem, not the amount of oil we're using.\"When food is heated up to a high temperature, new compounds are created, and some of them are known to be harmful to health,\" said Raj Bhopal, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, who led the research. \"This is not to do with frying. ... it's more to do with the cooking process, with the temperature.\"When foods are cooked at high temperatures, they release chemicals known as neo-formed contaminants, or NFCs. This group includes trans-fatty acids -- or trans fats -- that are known to increase the risk of heart disease. \"When the temperature is high, (trans fats) are produced at a very high rate,\" Bhopal said.The researchers believe cuisines that typically involve cooking food in hot oils at high temperatures may explain why higher rates of heart disease are seen in certain populations, such as among people of South Asian descent.South Asians -- including residents of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka -- have a four times greater risk of heart disease than the general population. Bhopal's own research has investigated this rise in risk among people living in Scotland.\"In Scotland, the highest rates of heart attack are in the Pakistani population,\" he said, referring to one of his earlier studies. \"The next group are Indians.\"At the bottom of the list were the Chinese.\"(They) were way down at the bottom,\" Bhopal said, adding that he was surprised, as all three communities had long been settled in Scotland and lived reasonably similar lifestyles. \"The explanation had to be around food.\"To find out, Bhopal and his team reviewed all of the available evidence on NFCs and the burden of these chemicals among South Asian and Chinese populations. They also looked at any links between these chemicals and heart disease, combined with a comparison of typical South Asian foods and their preparation methods against that of their Chinese counterparts. Avoiding the byproducts\"In the Chinese snacks, there are virtually no trans-fatty acids, less than 1% (in some cases),\" Bhopal said. \"In the Indian snacks, there's a vast amount.\" The Indian treat jalebi -- fried batter soaked in sugar syrup -- was found to average 17% trans fats and samosas 3.3%.Bhopal believes the difference comes down to Chinese meals including more boiled foods, lightly fried items and stir-fries, whereas Indian cooking entails longer, deeper frying of foods and the use of pressure cookers. \"The emphasis is on the temperature,\" he stressed.Even more accurately, the emphasis is on the temperature of your oils.\"This study shows that by heating and frying, you can change what appear to be perfectly healthy oils and make them unhealthy,\" said Michael Miller, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center, who was not involved in the research. By unhealthy, he means the creation of these chemical byproducts, such as trans fats. \"Heart disease can manifest if you (then) reuse oils that have been boiled,\" Miller added.The group also looked at other byproducts of heating oils to high temperatures, called advanced glycogen end-products. These are also known to increase the likelihood of heart disease.Bhopal used the example of cooking a chicken to highlight the vast differences in how much of these byproducts are produced. When a chicken is boiled, this cooking process releases an average of 1,000 glycogen end-products, whereas roasting and frying produce 4,000 and 9,000, respectively. \"Different forms of cooking are leading to vastly different results,\" he said.\"The focus traditionally has looked at the foods themselves, but not the fact you can take relatively healthy food and then make them unhealthy,\" Miller said. But he also noted that Bhopal's research is hypothetical at this point and needs further investigation.The researchers haven't \"actually tested a population,\" he said. \"But this is a good background story that I agree with.\"How to cool downThe team now hopes to explore heart rates in comparison to cooking methods among a population. In the meantime, however, both Bhopal and Miller suggest reducing the heat in the kitchen -- and in your takeout box.\"It makes sense to avoid snacks that are cooked in high-temperature oils,\" said Bhopal, who himself has now switched to cooking olive oil. \"Olive oil does not heat up to a very high temperature,\" he said.Miller agreed. \"Try not to boil oils ... and it's best to avoid fried foods,\" he said.But both note that people can't avoid these types of food and cooking methods at all times and, as with anything, suggest the need for moderation.\"Eating one meal is not going to do it, but it's doing it day in, day out, on a daily basis,\" Miller said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/health/high-temperature-cooking-increases-heart-disease-risk/index.html"}

{"_id":"Top Dems urge Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp to turn down Trump","articleText":" (CNN)Senior Senate Democrats are putting pressure on their red-state colleagues to turn down any offer from Donald Trump to serve in his administration, warning that their party could suffer if they join forces with the incoming president.Democrats are worried that if Trump adds two Democrats to his Cabinet -- potentially North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- the balance of power in the chamber could tilt further to the GOP. So they are making the case to their colleagues to stay put.\"I certainly hope they stay with us,\" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told CNN on Monday. \"We need them. America needs them. Although they are qualified to be Cabinet officials, I would not recommend it to them.\"At a private caucus meeting last Thursday, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his colleagues that he didn't have any issues with them having private conversations with Trump. But in the wake of news that Heitkamp planned to meet with Trump the next day, he urged them to keep him and his caucus informed of any commitments they planned to make with the new president.\"Sen. Schumer has told his colleagues there is nothing wrong with an open dialogue with the incoming administration,\" said Schumer spokesman Matt House. \"We hope they'll keep the caucus informed of those discussions.\"The discussion comes at an urgent time for Democrats. After a disappointing election cycle where they failed to regain the Senate majority, the party will likely only have 48 seats in the new Congress. And in the 2018 election cycle, Democrats face a daunting map, with the battle for control of the chamber running squarely through a spate of red states that Trump won overwhelmingly.If Manchin and Heitkamp were to leave for the Trump administration, the GOP would have a clear shot to pick up the open seats in 2018. In West Virginia, the Democratic governor, Earl Ray Tomblin, would fill the open seat until the next election in the red state. And in North Dakota, a special election would occur within 95 days of the vacancy, giving the GOP an immediate chance to grow their numbers in the first year under Trump.Manchin would not rule out taking a job with Trump, telling CNN, \"We have not talked specifics at all.\"Asked if he were concerned about giving the GOP a chance to pick up his seat, Manchin pushed back.\"The people of West Virginia sent me here,\" Manchin said Monday. \"I got to do what I can to make sure I'm helping my people.\"Since her Friday meeting, Heitkamp said she has had followup conversations with Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus. But Heitkamp declined to comment further Monday.\"We've had follow-on conversations; there's really nothing to say beyond that,\" Heitkamp said.It's unclear how serious Trump is taking the possibility of naming Manchin and Heitkamp to his Cabinet, but speculation has centered around the Democrats possibly being up for energy-related Cabinet jobs in the administration. Heitkamp met with Trump last Friday in Trump Tower, while Manchin plans to meet with the President-elect later this week after speaking by the phone with him last week.\"I always believed public officials must put their state and country first and set aside partisan politics to do what's right for the people they serve,\" Manchin said in a statement.Durbin added that the move appears motivated by Senate Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell, to add to their numbers in the chamber.\"I think it's a pretty shrewd move,\" Durbin said Monday. \"I imagine Sen. McConnell has a hand in this strategy, which is to remove candidates who are odds-on favorites in red states. ... I think part of the strategy is for the Republicans to pick up a few more seats in the Senate.\"Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said that the Trump move to court his colleagues puts Democrats in an awkward position since they believe Manchin and Heitkamp would ultimately be a moderating force for the incoming administration.\"That would be very difficult for us,\" Cardin said of losing either of the two senators to the Trump administration. \"It's a mixed message for us. Clearly they are great members but (losing them) would present additional challenges, which is probably one of the reasons why the President-elect is looking at these particular members.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/joe-manchin-heidi-heitkamp-donald-trump-senate-democrats/index.html"}
{"_id":"Top contender for defense secretary faces legislative hurdle","articleText":" (CNN)Ret. Marine Corps Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis has emerged as a favorite for the position of Defense Secretary in the new Trump administration. However, a decades-old legal statute barring service members from quickly entering civilian positions prevents him from being eligible for the job -- unless he gets a waiver from Congress.Section 903(a) of the National Defense Authorization act requires a seven-year wait period between active duty and serving as Secretary of Defense -- a civilian role -- for former service members. Mattis would need a special waiver from Congress, since he retired from the military in 2013. An aide to the House Armed Services Committee told CNN that they are conducting a review to examine how a waiver might be granted. The aide said no one from the President-elect's transition team had reached out to the committee, but committee staffers have started reviewing what would be required.Mattis wouldn't be the first defense secretary to require a congressional waiver. President Harry Truman appointed Gen. George Marshall to the position in 1950, nearly five years after he retired from the Army. Congress granted the waiver (at the time, the interval between active duty and defense secretary service was 10 years).As was the case with Marshall, a new law would have to be passed by both the House and Senate to enable the appointment of a military officer who had not been out of uniform for seven years.However, the aide doesn't anticipate much resistance in Congress. \"Mattis is pretty popular among the members,\" the staffer said. In Marshall's case, he noted, the whole process took only \"a couple of days.\"As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain would play a role in issuing the waiver for Mattis. On Monday, McCain released a statement says Mattis is \"one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.\" \"I hope he has an opportunity to serve America again,\" McCain said.Why this statute existsFormer House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers explained on \"New Day\" that this statute was put in place in 2008 because \"you don't want a military attitude in the civilian position.\" \"When you get to that Defense Secretary role, it has to be a broader, strategic impact brought to any decision you make in any strategic event you make around the world -- including, by the way, acquisitions of weapons,\" Rogers said. \"I think they just want a little distance there to make sure you don't just take a general and make them secretary. And that's why, originally, the law was passed to give that seven-year window.\"Former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen told CNN's Brianna Keilar, \"There's nothing magical in the seven years. They want to have enough time to say: Are you separate enough from the military ethic and culture and part of the community as such to be the civilian boss?\"Rogers cautioned that getting that waiver from Congress could become a costly use of political capital.\"Just remember, you have to invest political capital to get your nominee a waiver, and then you have to get your nominee through the Senate. So that's two different processes. And that should be a factor when you are considering if you want this person to be your next Secretary of Defense.\" Still, Rogers praised Mattis as a \"strategic thinker\" with a \"stellar reputation.\"\"Again, this is a very tough warrior who is a strategic thinker that thinks about the second and third order effects of every decision when you use your military,\" Rogers said. \"That's why I think he's attractive to the Trump folks and why he would, if he could go through this process, would be a really good Secretary of Defense.\"Maj. General James \"Spider\" Marks, who was on \"New Day\" with Rogers, said the retired general's confirmation was \"worth the political capital.\"\"Nobody is more well prepared than Gen. Jim Mattis,\" Marks said. \"He truly is a student of the profession and has demonstrated that throughout the course of his career without a blemish ... He is absolutely no nonsense, he's a very nuanced thinker, but he is very clear in how he approaches problem solving.\"  \"Frankly,\" Marks added, \"the military needs to shore up its relationship with the administration.\" He said the Trump administration needs more leadership, and Mattis would bring that to the table \"immediately.\"Ryan Browne contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/james-mattis-defense-secretary-waiver/index.html"}

{"_id":"Toxic chemicals are hiding in your house dust","articleText":" (CNN)When was the last time you dusted your house? Your answer could reveal a lot about your home habits, but the findings of a new study might have everyone upping their game -- and potentially keeping wet wipes and hand sanitizer nearby at all times.Researchers at George Washington University say 45 toxic chemicals are found commonly in your house dust, with 10 of them lurking in 90% of homes across the country.\"We wanted to identify which chemicals were present at the highest exposure in homes,\" said Dr. Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environmental occupational health who led the study. \"Some chemicals were in virtually every dust sample.\"To reveal which potential toxins we're being exposed to in the comfort of our own homes, Zota's team analyzed all studies that have sampled indoor environments in the United States since 2000. They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants. \"Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,\" Zota said. But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we're exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.Lurking in the dustThe chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products -- such as flooring -- cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish. To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations. The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances. Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. \"We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,\" said Zota.But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the \"highest estimated intake,\" meaning they are more likely to enter the body. \"You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,\" Zota said. \"These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.\"A risk to child developmentOne of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.\"Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,\" Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children \"can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.\"Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.\"We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,\" said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the Center for Environmental Research and Child's Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.\"There's a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.\"As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals. \"By compiling information in this way, there's always the possibility of exposures that haven't been studied yet,\" Bradman said.Preventing exposureSome advice to prevent exposure, other than regularly dusting your home, is to veer away from the traditional feather duster and use a powerful vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure that all dust particles are sucked up. Regular hand-washing -- which has a multitude of benefits -- will also reduce exposure to flame retardants found on the surfaces of furniture.The Silent Spring Institute has created an app to help people understand more about their environmental exposures, aptly named Detox Me.But both Zota and Bradman stress that there needs to be more research into the range of chemicals people are exposed to at home and changes at the policy level to reduce the number of chemicals entering people's households, through bans, better regulation and improved underlying chemistry during production.\"There may be chemicals out there that we don't know about, that we should know about,\" said Bradman, whose own research looks into exposure risks, particularly among children. His studies have found phthalates to be common in child care practices in the United States.\"But we can also reformulate materials so that chemicals don't just go into our bodies,\" he added. \"There may be ways to have better adhesion [of flame retardants to furnishings] so they don't get into the environment.\"The issue is also not specific to the United States.\"These consumer product chemicals are widely used throughout the globe and have been detected in homes in the UK and other European countries,\" Zota said, adding, \"since the European Union has different chemical regulations than the US, the average levels for some of the chemicals may be different than those we found for US homes.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/toxic-chemicals-house-dust/index.html"}

{"_id":"Trump Foundation tax return shows money given improperly ","articleText":"New York (CNN)The Trump Foundation admitted violating IRS rules by improperly giving money to someone close to the organization, according to a recent federal income tax filing.The filing, which was first reported by the Washington Post, was published on the website GuideStar, and raises more questions about potential IRS violations.In one instance, the Foundation checked a \"yes\" box when asked: \"(Did the Foundation) transfer any income or assets to a disqualified person (or make any of either available for the benefit or use of a disqualified person)?\"A Senior Research Fellow at GuideStar, Chuck McLean, told CNN that \"disqualified person\" is essentially \"IRS speak\" for a person who \"has significant influence over the activities of the organization or someone related to those people.\"Trump overseas business interests subject to new scrutinyGuideStar is a nonprofit information service that specializes in reporting on American nonprofit organizations. It has offices in Washington and Williamsburg, Virginia, that collect thousands of nonprofit tax returns annually and post them on its website.The Trump Foundation also checked \"yes\" when asked if it had engaged in any acts of \"self-dealing\" in prior years.McLean told CNN in an email that by checking that box, those actions had not been corrected.There's no indication on the 990 filing about precisely who the \"disqualified person\" was or even what activities are involved. The Trump Foundation, GuideStar says, has to file a form called a 4720 and then explain what took place and possibly pay an excise tax on them.Priebus: Trump's White House counsel will ensure no conflicts of interestThere were some other interesting items of note in the recent foundation document. In its section devoted to contributions, the largest single donor was the Trump Corporation to the tune of $566,370.The largest individual donation, though, came from a Ukrainian businessman who previously had donated more than $6 million to the Clinton Foundation over the years: Victor Pinchuk, who through his own foundation based in London, gave the Trump Foundation $150,000.Pinchuk's total net worth has been valued by Forbes Magazine at just around $1.4 billion. According to emails reported by WikiLeaks, Pinchuk also hired a lobbyist to arrange meetings at the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Some Republicans had called for a special prosecutor to look into both the donations by Pinchuk to the Clinton Foundation and to the reported hiring of the lobbyist.Deep into the 2015 Trump Foundation tax filing is another item of note: The Washington Post had reported that Donald Trump had spent close to $20,000 of foundation money to purchase an oil painting of himself.

{"_id":"Trump admits 'some connectivity' between climate change and human activity","articleText":"New York (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump conceded Tuesday there is \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate change and wavered on whether he would pull the United States out of international accords aimed at combating the phenomenon, which scientists overwhelmingly agree is caused by human activity. The statements could mark a softening in Trump's position on US involvement in efforts to fight climate change, although he did not commit to specific action in any direction. During the campaign, he vowed to \"cancel\" the US's participation in the Paris climate agreement, stop all US payments to UN programs aimed at fighting climate change and continued to cast serious doubt on the role man-made carbon dioxide emissions played in the planet's warming and associated impacts.\"I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much,\" Trump said Tuesday in a meeting with New York Times reporters, columnists and editors. He has previously called climate change a \"hoax\" invented by the Chinese. Asked if he would withdraw the US from international climate change agreements, Trump said he is \"looking at it very closely,\" according to Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Mike Grynbaum, who were live-tweeting the meeting. He added that he has \"an open mind to it,\" despite explicitly promising to withdraw from at least one climate accord on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's comments do not amount to a full reversal. The President-elect on the campaign trail repeatedly vowed to slash environmental protection regulations burdening US businesses and said that beyond the consequences to the planet, he is particularly mindful of the economic impact of combating climate change.He said he is considering \"how much it will cost our companies\" and the effect on American competitiveness in the global market, according to a tweet from Grynbaum.Trump's election sparked concerns from climate change activists that the incoming Republican president will roll back the progress made under the Obama administration.President Barack Obama made inroads with other countries -- China in particular -- toward new international agreements to roll back global carbon emissions, progress activist groups have worried will be undone by a Trump presidency.\"The disaster that Donald Trump represents for the climate cannot be understated,\" Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350.org, an environmental advocacy group, told CNN last week. \"He is the only head of state in the world who is an all-out climate denier and he has the most radical, anti-environmental policies of anyone to ever assume the role of the presidency.\" While Trump's comments on Tuesday may suggest an ambivalence -- if not a softening -- on the issue of climate change, the President-elect's actions suggest his election did not cause him to immediately abandon his climate skepticism. Trump appointed a leading climate change denier Myron Ebell to lead his transition efforts on the Environmental Protection Agency and has not stepped back from his vow to slash environmental regulations he argued during the campaign are an undue burden on US businesses.\"Whether or not Trump acknowledges the connection between human pollution and climate change, the science is real. Climate change is happening, and fossil fuels are making it worse,\" Greenpeace USA spokesman Travis Nichols said. \"No matter what he says, Trump's 100 days plan and his proposed Cabinet appointees put climate denial front and center in his administration and put the planet and its people at risk.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/donald-trump-climate-change-new-york-times/index.html"}

{"_id":"Trump and China on collision course","articleText":"Washington (CNN)In speaking on the telephone with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and lashing out at China on Twitter over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump did more than bewilder leaders in Beijing and the White House.He made clear that he's serious about his vows to wring a new deal from China on trade and appears to be ready to challenge at least the atmospherics of the US relationship with Taiwan -- an issue of deep sensitivity in Beijing.His tactics also show that President Trump promises to be just as much of a disruptor in international relations as he has been in domestic politics, no matter what conventions get broken in the process.But so far, analysts say, it is not clear that Trump -- for all his bombast -- is preparing to tear up the strategic framework that has underpinned Sino-US relations since President Richard Nixon went to China to open relations between the two countries four decades ago.Trump's inexperience in foreign affairs and the fact that he is yet to name a secretary of state or senior Asia policy team means there is uncertainty in Washington and across the Pacific about his intentions.China watchers are trying to work out if the call with Tsai is a sign that Trump is ready to challenge the strategic ambiguity of the \"One China\" policy itself that has been the cornerstone of bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations.The formula, enshrined in the documents that eventually led to the establishment of US relations with China, permits Beijing to regard Taiwan as a part of China and the United States to sell the nationalist island arms to defend itself against the mainland, and has headed off a major US-China clash over the issue.Trump's call with Tsai was initially described by the presidential transition as a courtesy call. But now his supporters suggest that the first reported direct contact between a president or a president-elect with a Taiwanese leader in 40 years was more significant.\"Taiwan is our ally,\" former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore said in a radio interview Monday on the Big John and Ray Show on WLS AM890. \"That is a country that we have backed because they believe in freedom. We ought to back our ally, and if China doesn't like it, screw 'em.\"Reince Priebus, Trump's pick to be his chief of staff, said Monday that Moore is not an adviser for Trump's transition.But the diplomatic balance over Taiwan is so delicate that some analysts fear Trump could be starting a confrontation that could easily spin out of control, endanger other crucial areas of the US-China relationship and even so hike tensions that a military clash is possible in the Pacific.\"I think that until the inauguration, China is unlikely to let this escalate with the President-elect,\" said Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.\"After January 20, I think all bets are off.\"\"China would be willing to sacrifice cooperation across the board to stand firm against any move to give Taiwan diplomatic recognition and undermine the \"One China policy,\" according to Weiss.Trump takes fresh swipe at ChinaWhat is Trump's strategy?When news broke of Trump's conversation Friday with Tsai, many foreign policy experts simply chalked it up to a rookie error.But after Trump hit back on Twitter by pointing out the seemingly illogical convention that will give him power as president to sell arms to Taiwan but not talk to its leader, the consensus began to shift.When Trump returned to Twitter over the weekend to accuse China of devaluing its currency and building a \"massive military complex\" in the South China Sea, it became clear that he was making a tough initial gambit in his unfolding relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\"He wants to negotiate a new deal with China. Obviously this call does what he said he is going to do. He wants to shake up China,\" said Michael Pillsbury, an author and China expert who has advised Trump and called him a \"strategic genius.\"\"He is going to be firm and he is reminding them we need to have a talk now (between) Beijing and Washington,\" Pillsbury said on CNN Monday.Trump's attitude mirrors a recent Foreign Policy article written by two other advisers -- Peter Navarro and Alexander Gray -- that was seen widely as a blueprint for his upcoming China strategy.The authors warned that President Barack Obama's Asia pivot, partly conceived to cope with the rise of China, was a case of talking loudly but \"carrying a small stick.\"Trump, they suggested, would adopt a policy of \"peace through strength,\" vastly expanding the US Navy to respond more robustly to Chinese territorial claims in the East and South China Seas and make clear that American interests in the region would be paramount.Patrick Cronin, a senior director at the Center for A New American Security, said that Trump was intent on demonstrating to China that its rising power would not be met by an atrophying United States.\"What Trump is doing is to try to create new leverage, new maneuvering room in what is going to be a protracted complex negotiating position with China,\" said Cronin, who backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. \"This move signals early on that he is capable of coloring outside the lines on US-China relations, not just in domestic policy. \"White House weighs in China's responseSome commentators have argued that China sees Trump's presidency as an opportunity. His decision to cancel the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is seen as playing into Beijing's hopes of establishing its own economic order in the region, since the massive US-led trade deal cut out the Asian superpower.Trump's campaign trail warnings that Japan and South Korea must do more to pay for their US defense umbrella were also interpreted as presaging a US retreat from the region.But China might be taking another look at Trump after this weekend.Beijing's initial response to Trump's call with Tsai was sophisticated -- restating the importance of the \"One China policy\" but also giving Trump and his team the benefit of the doubt by blaming Taiwan for initiating the call.Such a strategy suggests that Beijing could expect that the new US president will initially have a contentious relationship with China -- as has happened in the past -- before the logic of the wider relationship eases tensions.Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a longtime China-watcher, said Beijing had made a decision not to play into Trump's hands.\"I think we are in for at least a couple of months of general uncertainty,\" Rudd told CNN's Richard Quest on Monday.\"The Chinese response still is this is a shake-down period -- perhaps President Trump is pushing us and probing us. Perhaps he is seeking to obtain some negotiating chips,\" he suggested they're saying, \"but we are not going to rise to the bait.\"However, Beijing also sent clear signs -- through a Global Times editorial, often a conduit for Communist Party thought -- that if Trump was spoiling for a fight, he could be biting off more than he can chew.\"No matter what the reasons are behind Trump's outrageous remarks, it appears inevitable that Sino-US ties will witness more troubles in his early time in the White House than any other predecessor,\" the Times said. \"We must be fully prepared, both mentally and physically, for this scenario.\"Kerry says Trump did not consult State Dept. prior to callsIf it comes to it, China could make life difficult for the Trump administration.It could refuse to help slow the nuclear program of close ally North Korea, impose tariffs on US goods or make it more difficult for American businesses to operate in China. Weiss said Beijing could also hold military maneuvers to show the US and Taipei \"that China's resolve is unshaken.\"Trump's critics are puzzled why he would open his relationship with China by initiating a clash over Taiwan and then doubling down.\"Some of the progress we have made in our relationship with China could be undermined by this issue flaring up,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest warned.Christopher Hill, a former assistant secretary of state, said that the \"One China\" policy was successful and did not need fixing.\"It's not an issue, it works, it is not among the list of the terrible problems in East Asia,\" Hill told CNN International's Hala Gorani.\"If we start going after things that are not a problem, I think that some of these problems that we have for which we need US-China cooperation, if you will, we are going to find it tougher and tougher to work with the Chinese,\" he continued.Opinion: Trump's brilliant moveNo consensus in WashingtonStill, there is no consensus in Washington that Trump really wants to throw the foundations of US-China policy out the window.Walter Lohman, a former Republican Senate policy aide who is now director of Asian Studies at the Heritage Foundation, said that both sides remain committed to the basic post-Nixon era framework of US-China relations.\"I could see tensions increasing, but all within the framework,\" he said. \"They definitely want to preserve it, and I think right now, they are calculating that we want to do the same.\"Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific once lived in Taiwan and has been to China more than 50 times, and said he saw no risk to the \"One China Policy.\"Asked on CNN whether Taiwan could cause a military clash between the US and China, he added: \"Not at all.\"\"I think that the Chinese understand how important we are to their economic success,\" Salmon said on CNN.Despite the uproar, it's too early to panic about the state of US-China relations under Trump, according to Rudd.\"Let's not proclaim cataclysm on the basis of a tweet or two, or four or six,\" he said.UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect that Moore is not an adviser on the transition.

{"_id":"Trump could bring a different kind of diversity to the Supreme Court","articleText":"Go inside the election that changed everything: Order your copy of CNN's book \"Unprecedented,\" and explore CNN's coverage of \"A race like no other.\"  (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump is making one thing clear about the Supreme Court: He wants to do more than just solidify the conservative bent on the bench.As he considers a list of nominees to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Trump is looking for a kind of diversity the current court lacks. The potential nominees all have sterling judicial conservative credentials. But the current list represents something else -- a nod to judges from \"flyover\" states, an appreciation for non-Ivy League schools and even a dash of political experience. Many on Trump's list wore different hats before donning their judicial robes. And some have personal stories that could attract the President-elect. In the coming weeks, Trump will likely sit down with candidates whose judicial paper trail will elevate them to the top tier. Here's what's different about Trump's list, who offer geographic diversity different from the current court majority who have worn out the Acela Corridor. The 'revenge' of the flyover states Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told an audience of judicial conservatives last month that the election represented the \"revenge of flyover country.\"  So might Trump's list. The current Supreme Court consists of four justices from the Northeast: Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Samuel Alito. Chief Justice John Roberts grew up in the Midwest but his professional life has centered on Washington. Justice Stephen Breyer was born on the West Coast but has spent many years in his home in Boston. Trump's list is geographically diverse, including names from Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri and Minnesota. At an appearance at the University of Arizona last August, Justice Elena Kagan noted the issue of geographic diversity and the fact that many justices come from the \"non square states.\" \"There are ways in which the court is not right now a particularly diverse institution, \" she said. \"More than gender, or race or ethnicity, it really does have to do with this kind of coastal perspective\" she said and noted that most of the Court has spent their lives in DC, New York and Boston. \"Those who haven't, chances are it's because they've lived in California,\" she quipped. She was quick to say that it didn't mean that the justices have all had the same experiences, but there \"is a lack of geographic diversity\" that she said might not impact how a case is decided, but more how the court is perceived. Personal stories countBesides geographic diversity, Trump might seek a candidate that brings a strong personal story to the court.Last month, Judge Thomas Hardiman appeared in Washington to moderate a complicated panel concerning labor and employment law for the conservative Federalist Society. He told the panel he might have to channel his prior taxi driving experience to address the subject. Indeed, before he was appointed as a judge at 37 years old, Hardiman drove a cab to earn funds. He was the first child in his family to attend college. Now 51, he could be a lasting legacy for Trump. Think about the fact that Justice Clarence Thomas just celebrated his 25th year on the bench and the man who nominated him, George H.W. Bush, has been out of the political arena for decades.Judge Rayond Gruender of the 8th Circuit has a different kind of story. Long before he took the bench, he suffered an unbelievably violent attack at the hands of his father. According to local news stories, Gruender's father shot him in the stomach during a family dispute before taking his own life in 1986. \"The ordeal led to Gruender's significant involvement with a non-profit organization that assists victims of domestic violence\" according to the Minnesota Bar Association. Different kind of diversity Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- the court's first Latina and third female -- is often asked about the importance of diversity, and her answer is about more than race or gender. \"Diversity of life experiences, I believe, are the most important part of what you want to look at with justices,\" she said at the University of Wisconsin Law School in September. \"The more diversity in its professional experience and life's experience that people have the more fulsome the conversation will be about the law.\" A candidate who would certainly bring a different type of experience to the court is Margaret Ryan. Ryan is a former active duty marine, including serving as an aide de camp to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Ryan has more conventional credentials as well, as a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and is serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. But how many nominees have served in both Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm? Nan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, has lashed out at the list saying to reflects a radical-right\" ideology. Unlike Trump who could stress diversity on the list she points to potential nominees who \"threaten fundamental rights\" and favor \"the powerful and privileged\" over every day American.\" There's also political experience.When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor left the court she took with her the experience of elected politics. Mike Lee could change that. Sure, he's been a clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, twice, but more important he's the junior senator from Utah. Judge Steve Colloton has worn many hats including a stint working as an Associate Independent Counsel for the Office of Kenneth Starr from 1994-1996. Justice Diane Sykes has never worked in politics, but she did spend some time as a journalist.Non-Ivy LeaguersSupreme Court justices tend to hire clerks from the Ivy League and they have all attended elite schools. Trump's list is largely devoid of those candidates. Judge William Pryor, for example, sits on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and attended Northeast Louisiana University and Tulane University School of Law. Judge Diane Sykes attended Marquette University Law School. Justice David Stras attended the University of Kansas. Judge Raymond Kethledge -- a former Kennedy clerk -- spent time at Wayne State University.  Amul Thapar, a district court judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, is from Michigan and went to Boston College and UC Berkeley. Thapar was the first South Asian American to be named to an Article III federal judgeship. Ivy League schools need not feel slighted. For example, Neil Gorsuch attended Columbia and Harvard, and then topped it off with a stint at Oxford. But he might have slipped in because he's considered a champion of Scalia's judicial philosophy of originalism.CNN's George T.

It's an unprecedented allegation by a president-elect.Trump won the Electoral College and thus the White House, but the Democratic nominee leads him in the popular vote by about two million ballots.\"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump tweeted.\"It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4- states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" he added.This is the first time he has alleged voter fraud in his own victory and there is no evidence of any widespread voter fraud. Trump could be referencing a series of fake stories on conspiracy websites that said he actually beat Clinton in the popular vote count. Trump's transition team did not return requests for comment Sunday afternoon. He later added: \"Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\"Recount effortsTrump has been railing over the weekend against a recount effort led by the Green Party, that he has dubbed a \"scam.\" Green Party officials filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday after reports of possible voting discrepancies in areas that used paper ballots versus those where electronic voting took place.Wisconsin Green Party co-chairman George Martin said the party is seeking a \"reconciliation of paper records\" -- a request that could go further than a simple recount, possibly spurring an investigation into the integrity of Wisconsin's voting system. \"This is a process, a first step to examine whether our electoral democracy is working,\" Martin said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/politics/donald-trump-voter-fraud-popular-vote/index.html"}

{"_id":"Trump likely to tap Cubs co-owner for deputy Commerce post","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump is likely to pick Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts to be deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, according to two sources.   Ricketts hails from a family of powerful conservative donors, led by parents Joe and Marlene Ricketts. He has been a prolific donor, too, running a conservative super PAC that aided Trump in the waning days of the race. CNN has reported that financier Wilbur Ross is a leading candidate to head the Commerce Department. But the Ricketts family has had a rocky past with Trump. Todd Ricketts had been an early supporter of former Trump opponent Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, co-chairing his campaign last year.After Walker dropped from the race, Marlene Ricketts poured millions into Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump effort aimed at defeating the billionaire businessman during the GOP primaries. In February, Trump fired back, alleging that members of the Ricketts family \"have a lot to hide.\"Trump later accused the family of doing a \"rotten job\" running the Cubs -- before they won the World Series -- when asked by The Washington Post what he meant by the February accusation.Ricketts' possible move to the Commerce Department continues Trump's recent trend of selecting top-level mainstream Republicans and mega-donors, part of a strategy of outreach to his former rivals, but one which also goes against his promise to box out powerful players.The news about Rickets was first reported by Bloomberg Politics.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/politics/todd-ricketts-trump-commerce-department/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump looks to critics for top jobs","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump is looking to some of his most bitter past opponents and critics as he assembles a Cabinet.Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney went from being \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics,\" who \"choked like a dog\" in his 2012 run against President Barack Obama, according to Trump, to now being considered for secretary of state.South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley went from being \"very weak on immigration\" and a governor who has \"embarrassed\" her state to being selected by Trump Wednesday as US ambassador to the UN.And Dr. Ben Carson went from being a GOP primary rival who is \"incapable of understanding foreign policy,\" and someone who \"has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse),\" to \"a greatly talented person,\" whom Trump is \"seriously considering\" as the next Housing and Urban Development secretary.Here's a look at some of Trump's former rivals, many of whom he engaged in fierce feuds with during the 2016 primary, who have now been selected or could be chosen to fill top positions in a Trump administration.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Mitt RomneyNews that Romney could join a Trump administration, much less to fill a top job like secretary of state, came as a surprise to many.One of the memorable moments in the 2016 campaign and one that crystallized the bitter feud between establishment and anti-establishment Republicans was Romney's brutal take-down of Trump. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee assailed Trump before an audience at the University of Utah in March, slamming the billionaire mogul as \"a phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \"His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,\" Romney said. \"He's playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\"Trump quickly returned fire.\"Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!\" Trump tweeted.\"@MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!\" Trump added.In June, Romney told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he would not back Trump and said a Trump presidency could lead to \"trickle-down racism.\"Trump tweeted, \"Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.\"Trump, who had endorsed Romney in 2012, consistently slammed the former Massachusetts governor following Romney's loss to Obama in 2012.\"If Mitt Romney were in the private sector & he suffered the horrendous loss of 2012, do you think he'd rehire himself for 2016?—I don't!\" Trump tweeted in 2014.Nikki HaleyNews that Haley accepted Trump's offer to become the next US ambassador to the UN is another unexpected twist.The South Carolina governor, who initially endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, sharply disavowed Trump and later backed his rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, after Rubio dropped out of the race.Trump said in January that Haley is \"very weak on illegal immigration\" and tweeted in March, \"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\"Haley did not back down and said in February that Trump represents \"everything a governor doesn't want in a president.\"Ben CarsonEarly on in the primary contest, Carson briefly began to lead Trump in some national polls, turning what had begun as a friendly relationship into to a rivalry defined by personal attacks and insults, largely from Trump.Trump slammed Carson for stories that the famed neurosurgeon tells in his book about his childhood, and accused his opponent of lying about his past.\"The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!\" Trump tweeted.\"With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?\" he added.Trump also told CNN's \"New Day\" that Carson -- the first surgeon to separate twins joined at the head -- is only an \"OK doctor\" and said, \"You look at his faith and I think you're not going to find so much.\"Carson attempted to avoid personal attacks and later endorsed Trump in March, a week after ending his own campaign.Bobby JindalThe Louisiana governor, who is rumored to be considered for the position of Secretary of the Health and Human Services, once called Trump an \"egomaniacal madman\" and a \"non-serious carnival act.\"Trump shot back against his then-Republican primary opponent, calling Jindal \"a little bit nasty,\" but adding that he is ultimately \"a nice guy.\"Jindal later endorsed Trump.Rick PerryFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry is said to be under consideration as Trump's Secretary of Energy pick. Perry was one of Trump's first and most outspoken opponents during the primary race and once called Trump \"a cancer on conservatism.\"Trump repeatedly hit the former Texas governor on immigration and questioned his intelligence. \"Rick Perry failed at the border. Now he is critical of me. He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants,\" Trump tweeted..@GovernorPerry failed on the border. He should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate,\" Trump followed up in June.\"Rick Perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border. He should be ashamed of himself. Gov. Abbott has since been terrific,\" he added a few days later.But Perry backed Trump in May after Cruz quit the race.Ben BernankeThe former chairman of the Federal Reserve is reportedly being eyed for the Secretary of the Treasury position, although Trump has slammed Bernanke in the past.\"With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value,\" he tweeted in 2012.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-rivals/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump national security pick once wrote Chelsea Manning should be tried for treason, executed if guilty","articleText":" (CNN)KT McFarland, Donald Trump's pick to be his deputy national security adviser, once wrote that former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning should be tried for treason and executed if found guilty.Manning was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for handing over a trove of classified documents to Wikileaks. McFarland, a national security analyst and host of an online Fox News show for years, made the comments in a weekly column on the Fox News' website.\"It's time to up the charges,\" she wrote of Manning in 2010. \"Let's charge him and try him for treason. If he's found guilty, he should be executed.\"The most recent U.S. Military execution of a service member was in 1961.McFarland was also critical of Wikileaks's founder Julian Assange in 2010, calling his group a \"terrorist organization\" and arguing that Assange was waging cyberwarfare against the United States.  She once called for him to be tried by a military tribunal in a 2010 television appearance.\"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange isn't some well-meaning, anti-war protestor leaking documents in hopes of ending an unpopular war. He's waging cyberwar on the United States and the global world order,\" McFarland wrote on Fox News. \"Mr. Assange and his fellow hackers are terrorists and should be prosecuted as such.\"In another column, she said Assange should be tried to fullest extent of the law \"as a warning to those who would follow his example.\" She added that the U.S. government should create new authority to prosecute both Manning and Assange.\"If we don't have the legal authority to prosecute him for espionage and to go after his alleged co-conspirator Pvt. Bradley Manning for treason and conspiracy, we should create it,\" she wrote.McFarland's view of the organization, however, appears to have shifted.  On her Twitter feed, she linked to stories on the Podesta emails, even using a hashtag that was started by Wikileaks for their document release. In an October on Fox News's RedEye, she mocked  Hillary Clinton's proposed campaign slogans, which were revealed by Wikileaks. In another appearance, she said Assange was trying to show and bring down corruption.\"As far as the Wikileaks, not the Russian connection, but the Julian Assange-Wikileaks connection, I think he's trying to bring down and show corruption, wherever it exists,\" she said in an October television appearance. \"They've just gotten their hands on Democrat stuff. I have no doubt that if they find their way into Republican emails that those will be released at some point to embarrass and influence as well.\"McFarland and the Trump transition team did not return requests for comment.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/politics/kfile-kt-mcfarland-manning-assange/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump now considering more than four for secretary of state, Conway says","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is now considering more than four people for secretary of state, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday. \"It is true that he's broadened the search and secretary of state is an incredibly important position for any president to fill,\" Conway told reporters Sunday morning in the Trump Tower lobby. \"He continues to talk to different people. I think you've all seen the list of four that already existed,\" Conway said. \"This week we'll have additional interviews with other candidates for secretary of state and other cabinet positions and deputy cabinet positions as well.\"Conway wouldn't reveal the names of the contenders for secretary of state, saying, \"I don't think we've released that.\" \"That list is expanding because there is not a finite list of finalists only because he will interview with additional candidates early this week,\" she said. Trump had previously tweeted that there were four finalists for the job. But asked Sunday whether there are now more in the mix, Conway said: \"More than four but I -- who knows how many finalists there will be. It's a big decision and nobody should rush through it.\"A transition source said former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican who was President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China and ran a failed campaign for the 2012 GOP nomination, is among the candidates. Vice President-elect Mike Pence wouldn't say who Trump is likely to select for secretary of state in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But he listed five men when asked about the job: 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Gen. David Petraeus, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and former UN Ambassador John Bolton. Asked whether Petraeus' conviction for mishandling classified information would disqualify him, Pence said: \"It'll be the president-elect's decision about the totality of General Petraeus's experience in background. But I first met General Petraeus when he was commanding 101st Airborne in Iraq, and then I saw him martial the plan and the resources for what became the successful surge in Iraq.

{"_id":"Trump offers Flynn job of national security advisor","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump announced he will tap Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for the role of national security advisor, the transition announced Friday.The announcement Friday said that Flynn was among three high profile national security positions -- including Mike Pompeo for CIA director and Jeff Sessions for attorney general -- that had been offered and accepted. Flynn, 57, was a top adviser and high-profile surrogate to Trump during his campaign, introducing the President-elect at rallies and serving as a top cheerleader on his hyper-active Twitter feed. \"General Flynn is one of the country's foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration,\" Trump said in a statement. His appointment won't require Senate confirmation, which is potentially helpful for Trump, as Flynn has a long history of controversial remarks and was fired as President Barack Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Flynn wrote in his 2016 book, \"The Field of Fight,\" that he was booted from Obama's administration by \"censors\" who were unhappy he'd told a congressional committee \"that we were not as safe as we had been a few years back.\" However, US officials said Flynn was pushed out because of his contentious management style. Flynn's Twitter feed -- regularly updated with pro-Trump comments -- is another source of potential scrutiny. Flynn apologized in July after retweeting a message that bashed Jewish people. The retweet came after Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on CNN that Russia was to blame for hacks of the Democratic National Committee. \"The corrupt Democratic machine will do and say anything to get #NeverHillary into power. This is a new low,\" Flynn tweeted. With it, he shared a link to a tweet by a user who had written, \">Cnn implicated. 'The USSR is to blame!' ... Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore.\" Flynn later apologized, saying he'd only meant to retweet Mook's remarks. A critical roleFirst created in the early days of the Cold War, the job of national security advisor is seen as critical to implementing a president's worldview on the various departments and agencies involved in national security. Famous national security advisers who made a major impact on American foreign policy have included Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft. Susan Rice is the current national security advisor.Flynn enjoys tremendous access and credibility with Trump, especially because he's had several tours of duty on the battlefield.\"What makes Gen. Flynn different from so many others that we've heard about on Donald Trump's transition team is he is the one with the real experience fighting on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst.\"Certainly, he would be a very plausible candidate for national security advisor, which is arguably the most important national security position in the government,\" Bergen added.But the question may be whether his management style rubs people the wrong way.Given Trump's reputation for loyalty, it is no surprise that Flynn would find himself in a key role in the Trump administration.But Flynn, having only retired from the Army in 2014, is actually limited in the positions he could fill. By law, military officers must be out of uniform for at least seven years before they are eligible to become secretary of defense, though it is possible that Congress could grant a waiver that would allow Flynn to be named to that post.Even before it was announced, the idea of Flynn becoming national security advisor was met with opposition from some Democrats.Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday, \"I'd be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive national security advisor.\"Handling of classified informationAt the Republican National Convention, amid shouts of \"lock her up\" from the audience, Flynn delivered a fiery speech condemning Clinton's handling of emails on her private server.\"I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server,\" Flynn said.But Flynn's own record with classified information has been called into question during his military career. On at least two occasions, his handling of classified information came under scrutiny by the US military.Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops. The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn't supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists.Asked by email about the allegation, Flynn told CNN, \"It is not true ... not even close.\" Flynn declined to comment further.In separate incident, the two officials with whom CNN spoke said Flynn did not follow established security procedures when he shared classified intelligence with allies.In an August interview with The Washington Post, Flynn has acknowledged the incident.\"The investigation on me was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat, and I'm proud of that one,\" he told the paper. \"That was substantiated because I actually did it.\"Flynn says he had permission to share the classified information. In both cases, sources say the retired general was informally reprimanded but never charged with wrongdoing.And in 2010, while still a serving senior officer, he published an article criticizing the state of US intelligence operations in Afghanistan. CNN has learned the CIA was so furious at Flynn for publicly disclosing shortfalls that the agency complained to the Pentagon, which had signed off on the article.CNN's Barbara Starr and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/trump-offers-flynn-job-of-national-security-adviser/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump overseas business interests subject to new scrutiny","articleText":"New York (CNN)Meetings between President-elect Donald Trump and the Japanese prime minister as well as a subsequent meeting with business partners from India are raising questions about how difficult it may be to untangle Trump's worldwide properties once he is sworn in.A CNN review of Trump's most recent financial disclosures show the President-elect has about 150 companies that have had dealings in at least 25 countries outside of the US, including Turkey, China, Saudi Arabia, and Azerbaijan. Those business interests have ranged from beverage sales in Israel to golf course developments in the UAE. Although the location of some of Trump's foreign business deals could overlap with future foreign policy decisions, many of Trump's foreign business ties involve licensing deals, in which another party owns the property and pays Trump to use his brand. The Trump Organization has created multiple companies to individually handle each of these deals.For example, the President-elect listed two separate companies in his disclosures linked to the Trump Tower in Punta del Este, Uruguay. Although a brochure promoting the property includes a photograph of Trump and quotes his praises of the hotel, his organization's website discloses that developer Aetos SA owns the property and states it is not \"developed or sold by Donald J. Trump.\"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with the President-elect last week in Trump Tower but no American reporters and media photographers were present. Instead, a photo was released, showing Ivanka Trump attending the session, and Japanese media released video of the meeting.That meeting, according to reports, also resulted in an exchange of gifts including a gift to Trump of a gold driver made by a company called Honma with an estimated value of around $4,000.  Later that week, two businessmen from India who currently own Trump-branded properties near Mumbai, India, met with him at Trump Tower. It was merely a social call according to the Trump Organization.That meeting in particular is raising questions. It is not illegal for a sitting president to run a business but it is a question of ethics and optics.KellyAnne Conway, the President-elect's adviser, told reporters that she is \"very confident\" that Trump is not breaking any laws.\" \"He has many lawyers, accountants and advisers who tell him he must do and what he can't do,\" she said.Would a blind trust work?One difficulty to be faced is that a large part of Trump's business empire is himself. His partners across the globe purchase the right to license his name and his brand because it often brings in more rent money for hotel rooms, office space and condominiums.A former Bush administration lawyer, Richard Painter, told CNN that one solution is a blind trust. But that's not perfect by any means. \"You can't just put the assets in a blind trust and pretend you don't own them,\" Painter says. \"That's not a blind trust. You have to dispose of the assets first through an initial public offering or some other plan.\"In a debate during the Republican primary season, Trump said he would pass the brand on to his children but then conceded he didn't know exactly if that would work.\"I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country,\" he said.Republican Rep. Sean Duffy said Trump's businesses need to be truly separated from the White House.\"You can't have a scenario where the Trump Organization goes to the kids but the kids are also part of the administration. You have to make sure you're truly walled off and Mr. Trump is focusing on America and there's no self-interest or self-profit in what he does as the President,\" Duffy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" Monday.\"As you saw, the concern with Hillary Clinton was that in the State Department, she was helping raise money -- or the allegation to raise money -- with the Clinton Foundation. Americans were outraged by that. You don't want to see Mr. Trump in the same scenario.\"\"He doesn't have any power yet. That's what's key,\" Duffy said. \"This has to be done by January 20, but what happens today I think the processing of putting these assets into a blind trust or at least walling them off so he doesn't have access to the process or decisions.\"CNN's Adrienne Shih contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/trump-overseas-business-interests/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump picks Sessions for attorney general","articleText":"Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions to be his next attorney general, the presidential transition announced Friday.Sessions, 69, is currently serving his fourth Senate term and was the first sitting senator to endorse Trump. During Trump's campaign, he served as a key validator from within the Republican establishment at critical times and urged Republicans to coalesce around Trump.Sessions had been in consideration for several Cabinet positions, and as one of Trump's earliest and most loyal supporters.\"Jeff has been a highly respected member of the U.S. Senate for 20 years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is a world-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and US Attorney in the state of Alabama. Jeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.\"United by their hardline stance against illegal immigration, Sessions helped Trump craft his campaign's national security policy. His top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, also joined Trump's campaign. Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismSessions was one of President Barack Obama's fiercest opponents, voting against his nominees to the Supreme Court from his post on the Judiciary Committee and opposing Obama's other major domestic initiatives.He's broken ranks with Republicans, as well, voting against the bank bailout amid the 2008 economic collapse. The former US attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general isn't without controversy. His appointment to a federal district court by then-President Ronald Reagan sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racially tinged remarks. Donald Trump's transition moves to right the shipHe had denounced the 1965 Voting Rights Act and had labeled the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP \"un-American\" and said the organizations \"forced civil rights down the throats of people.\"A black Justice Department staffer said Sessions had called him \"boy\" and claimed he had thought the Ku Klux Klan \"were OK until I found out they smoked pot.\"  Sessions was mentioned as a potential running mate for Trump and advised him on his selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who is now helming Trump's transition effort. In May, Trump called Sessions a \"fantastic person.\"The Alabama senator said during a taping of Politico's \"Off Message\" podcast that same month that \"the leaders in all parties tend to adjust to reality. They just have to or they won't remain in office ... Already, many are sensing it.\"Sessions has also defended one of Trump's most controversial policy proposals: His ban on Muslims traveling into the United States. Trump offers Flynn job of national security advisor\"He simply said, and the way I understand it is, that we should slow down. Let's have a pause and begin to analyze where the threats are coming from,\" Sessions told CNN in June, amid questions about whether Trump's position was shifting. \"We have a toxic ideology, hopefully very small within Islam; certainly most people, most Muslims don't agree with this violent, jihadist approach. And we need to figure out a better way to identify that.\"In the past, Sessions has signaled support for a no-fly zone in Syria. \"We need to consider the political ramifications. What's happening to Europe as a result of refugee flows is just incredible. Three senior European officials told me the European Union is threatened by this, the very existence of it,\" he said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in January 2016. He has also critiqued Obama's handling of Syria. \"The situation in Syria is a colossal disaster. I do not believe it had to happen. I believe a wise statesman could have foreseen some of the difficulties we're facing today. And we should have been more cautious and careful in our declarations of how we expect Syria to develop over the years. It hasn't developed like President Obama projected. And disaster has been the situation,\" Sessions said at a September hearing. \"It seems to me that the problem is that, with our support, ISIS is being damaged, but they're not utterly destroyed.\" Like Trump, Sessions has questioned whether European countries are contributing enough to NATO. \"I am wondering do they have a will to survive themselves and/or have they just gotten in the habit of expecting us to step up to the plate to fund their defense. It is an unacceptable thing,\" he said in March.

{"_id":"Trump should be the one apologizing, not Mitt Romney","articleText":"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM's radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Looks like some Donald Trump supporters are still holding a grudge against Mitt Romney for the way the 2012 GOP nominee criticized Trump during the campaign. The President-elect is considering Romney for secretary of state, and according to news reports, before these Trump insiders will support Romney, they want him to apologize for calling Trump such things as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump's top advisers, used the language of betrayal to describe how Trump supporters feel about Romney, telling CNN's Dana Bash, \"I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position.\" After being criticized for assailing Romney publicly instead of conveying her thoughts to Trump privately, Conway tweeted that the \"point is the volume & intensity of grassroots resistance to Romney is breathtaking.\" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a big-time Trump supporter, even offered detailed instructions on what Romney must do before he could be forgiven: \"There's only one way that I think Mitt Romney could even be considered for a post like that (secretary of state) and that is he goes to a microphone in a very public place and repudiates everything he said. ...\"  Huckabee is on to something. If an apology is a prerequisite for supporters to forgive Romney, then the President-elect should follow this advice and publicly apologize to those groups of Americans he cruelly attacked if he wants us to forgive him. Actually, Trump should take Huckabee's exact instructions and go \"to a microphone in a very public place\" and make it clear that he's truly sorry for the vile words he said about so many communities, which were far worse than anything Romney said regarding the businessman.So where should Trump start apologizing? Well, it would make sense for him to begin with the Latino community, given that he started demonizing members of it from the beginning of his campaign with his lie that Mexico was sending \"rapists\" and drug dealers to the United States.  Next, Trump can take a limo ride to Paterson, New Jersey, home of a sizable Muslim population, and apologize to Muslim Americans for the horrible comments he made about that community.  For starters, Trump can acknowledge he lied when he told a rally crowd he saw \"thousands\" of Muslims cheering in New Jersey on 9/11. (A \"pants on fire\" falsehood, Politifact said.)  And he should add his sincere regrets for stoking hate against Muslims with his irresponsible comments such as \"Islam hates us.\"Perhaps soon thereafter Trump can hold a press conference -- something he has not done since July -- and offer a heartfelt apology to the disabled community for mocking the physical appearance of journalist Serge Kovaleski, a man who suffers from a chronic condition that limits the movement of his arms. As a reminder, when Kovaleski refused to support Trump's lie that \"thousands\" of Muslims cheered in New Jersey on 9/11, Trump publicly mocked the reporter at a November 2015 campaign rally by mimicking his disability.And if Trump really wants to try to build goodwill, he should make a speech apologizing to the women of America. After all Trump not only bragged about sexually assaulting women in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, he mocked Carly Fiorina's face and, worse, he publicly shamed the 11 women who accused him of sexual misconduct by calling them all liars. True, some women were not troubled by these comments, but a public apology to the big chunk that were could possibly build bridges. There are, of course, others Trump might want to consider apologizing to -- to prove he has changed as a person and learned right from wrong. For example, Mercutio Southall Jr., a Black Lives Matter protester attacked by Trump's fans at a campaign rally in November 2015. The day after the event, Trump stunningly defended his white supporters beating this man up.No one can guarantee that a Trump apology will actually cause these people and communities to forgive him. For many Americans -- including myself -- it will take much more than just an \"I'm sorry\" by Trump to make up for the hate he spewed during his campaign, leaving in its wake a slimy tide of bigotry, xenophobia and misogyny in America.If Trump truly wants to be the president of all the people, as he tells us, the first step is apologizing to those he wronged. Without that, he has no chance of ever being a president for all.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/26/opinions/trump-should-apologize-not-romney-obeidallah/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump speaks with five more foreign leaders ","articleText":"Washington  (CNN)Donald Trump has spent the tail end of this holiday week continuing to have phone conversations with foreign leaders.The President-elect's transition team said Friday that Trump spent the past few days speaking with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven.He also spoke with Borut Pahor, prime minister of Slovenia, where his wife Melania was born. All leaders offered their congratulations, the team said in a statement. Trump has now spoken with at least 40 foreign leaders since his election, according to his transition team. The businessman has been criticized for not doing enough to separate his personal and commercial interests as an international real estate developer from his role as America's President-elect. In one recent example, Trump's daughter Ivanka participated in a phone call with Mauricio Macri, president of Argentina, where Trump has active real estate projects.

{"_id":"Trump supporter Sarah Palin calls Carrier deal 'crony capitalism'","articleText":" (CNN)Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- an early supporter of Donald Trump who is under consideration to serve in his Cabinet -- is criticizing the use of subsidies to keep an Indiana-based air conditioning company from sending jobs to Mexico, a move the President-elect has spotlighted as one of his first victories since being elected.\"When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,\" she wrote Friday in a \"Young Conservatives\" column. \"Meanwhile, the invisible hand that best orchestrates a free people's free enterprise system gets amputated. Then, special interests creep in and manipulate markets.\" \"Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail,\" Palin added.Trump helped broker the deal with Carrier that gave them $7 million in financial incentives over the next decade to keep 1,000 jobs at an Indianapolis plant, though some jobs are still going to Mexico. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is governor of Indiana, toured the site Thursday.  Trump didn't save as many Carrier jobs as he claimedBut Palin said when the government chooses companies to favor, the American economy is \"doomed.\"\"Politicians picking and choosing recipients of corporate welfare is railed against by fiscal conservatives, for it's a hallmark of corruption. And socialism,\" the former Republican vice presidential candidate said. \"A $20 trillion debt-ridden country can't afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we're doomed.\"Palin -- who endorsed Trump early in the campaign -- is reportedly being considered to be Trump's secretary of veterans affairs or for interior secretary.\"However well meaning, burdensome federal government imposition is never the solution. Never. Not in our homes, not in our schools, not in churches, not in businesses,\" she wrote. \"Gotta' have faith the Trump team knows all this.

{"_id":"Trump supporter on prosecuting Hillary Clinton: 'Let's set this one aside'","articleText":" (CNN)Rep. Sean Duffy said Wednesday there is no need for Donald Trump to prosecute Hillary Clinton because the American public already has already made its decision about her.\"I think that the American people, in regard to the email server -- we had a big American jury trial in this election and Mrs. Clinton lost,\" the Wisconsin Republican and Trump supporter told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\" \"She's been called out for her bad acts with the server.\"During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary of state after the FBI and Justice Department decided against prosecuting Clinton for her use of a private email server while serving in the Obama administration. Trump supporters embraced this plan often chanting \"lock her up!\" at his rallies and Trump interrupted Clinton during the second presidential debate to say if he were president, \"You'd be in jail.\"But now the President-elect said he won't push for prosecution of his former rival, telling The New York Times that she has \"suffered greatly.\"Duffy agreed that Clinton has been through enough.\"At what point, we can say is that enough. Did we get our pound of flesh on her? I think so,\" he said. \"Let's set this one aside. The investigation has already taken place. Let's move forward in making America great again.\"If the Trump administration is going to effectively accomplish the President-elect's agenda, he can't be tied up with prosecuting Clinton, Duffy argued.\"If you're going to actually get the big things done that are going to help grow our economy and put these middle (class) Americans that have been left behind back to work, you can't have a big massive big fight with Mrs. Clinton,\" he said.

{"_id":"Trump takes aim at First Amendment","articleText":" (CNN)In 51 days, Donald Trump will swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. But judging from his red hot Twitter feed, Trump is already chafing at its constraints.The President-elect called Tuesday for punishing anyone who burns the American flag by \"perhaps\" jailing them -- or even stripping them of citizenship. The Twitter broadside revived concerns that the incoming President isn't fully aware of the limits he will face in office or that he may try to eliminate as many curbs as possible.The early morning blast was classic Trump, picking at an emotive political scar that enlivens his most loyal supporters, hijacking news coverage and forcing everyone in Washington to respond to his own controversial views -- and then wonder if he really means it. It's a tactic familiar from the presidential campaign when Trump's mastery at wielding Twitter as a weapon was at the heart of his battle plan that demolished the Bush and Clinton political dynasties.Why Donald Trump won't changeBut the tweet was especially notable because it seemed to look past two Supreme Court rulings that held flag burning is form of free speech protected by the First Amendment. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, who Trump has lauded as a judicial hero and model for his future nominees, was a crucial vote supporting the majority in each case.The big question is whether Trump's comments, which would be extraordinary coming from any other incoming president, should be interpreted as a sign of intent or simply another example of the unusual way in which he blows off steam so publicly.'Remarkable'\"It is pretty remarkable that the President-elect of the United States is calling for penalties, criminal penalties for protected speech,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on Tuesday. \"Why is he doing this? That is the question. Is he trying to distract attention from something else? I don't know why he would be, his transition seems to be going pretty well. What is the purpose behind this? I don't really get it.\"David Axelrod, a CNN political analyst and former strategist for President Barack Obama, encouraged his Twitter followers Tuesday to pay less attention to what Trump says and more to how he behaves.\"Pressing issue of the day? Best to ignore, unless & until it becomes something more than an AM red meat serving from Dr. Trump & Mr. Tweet,\" Axelrod tweeted.Still, the spectacle of a President-elect calling for someone to be disowned by their nation for exercising their constitutional rights -- albeit while acting in a way many Americans find distasteful -- is a shocking one. It is extraordinarily difficult for the federal government to strip a natural born American of their citizenship. Such a move requires an act of will upon the part of the person, such as treason. And given the checks and balances of the political system, it's unlikely that Trump could enact a law corresponding with his tweet that would withstand a court challenge.What the Supreme Court has said about flag burningYet one reason Trump's salvos get so much attention is because he has frequently left the impression that as president, he will nudge right up against the Constitution.His proposal for a ban on Muslim immigration during the campaign -- since watered down -- appeared to conflict with the constitutional guarantees of religious freedom.Some legal analysts, meanwhile, have warned that that the Emoluments clause in the Constitution -- which bars gifts being paid to top officials from foreign governments -- could trip Trump up if he fails to draw a firm line between his global business interests and his administration.Trump's foreign business interests: 144 companies in 25 countriesTrump also sparked alarm when he told journalists at The New York Times this month that \"the law is totally on my side, meaning, the President can't have a conflict of interest.\"Attacks on news organizationsTrump's attacks on news organizations, including CNN and The New York Times, have also worried those who fear he has the First Amendment in his sights. He warned during the campaign that he would \"open up\" libel laws to make it easier for him to sue news organizations if he was elected president.But one of the emerging characteristics of Trump's presidential transition that is likely to linger on in his administration is the difficulty in discerning exactly how serious to take his threats and bluster.Asked by New York Times Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson in the meeting with the paper's journalists and executives whether he respected the First Amendment, Trump was conciliatory.\"I think you'll be happy,\" he said. \"I think you'll be happy ... I think you'll be O.K. I think you're going to be fine.\"Some Democrats, wary of presidential overreach, say there's no choice but to take Trump at his word.\"When do we take Donald Trump seriously? My answer to that question is February 2016, when none of us took him seriously and now he is the President-elect,\" said Mark Alderman, a Democratic strategist and former Electoral College elector. \"I am done not taking him seriously,\" said Alderman, who is chairman of Cozen O'Connor Public Strategies. \"I have at least learned that lesson. I think everything that the man does has to be taken seriously because he has demonstrated over the last 18 months that he was serious about being nominated.\"He added: \"He was serious about being elected. It would be a mistake to say he is not serious about governing and serious about what he says about governing.\"Hill GOP split on how to roll back ObamacareThe White House took Trump's remarks at face value, warning that there should be no infringements on free speech, even though most Americans oppose flag burning.\"The freedom that we all have to express ourselves in the way that we chose to do so is protected by the United States Constitution,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. \"The need to protect those rights is in place to protect speech and expression not just when we agree with it but also when we find it offensive.\"Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell parried questions about Trump's comments by framing the constitutional position on flag burning as a decided issue.\"The Supreme Court has held that activity is a protected First Amendment right, a form of unpleasant speech and in this country, we have a long tradition of respecting unpleasant speech,\" McConnell said. \"I happen to support the Supreme Court's decision on that matter.\"GOP's default postureDeflecting and ignoring a politically loaded Trump tweet could become a default Republican posture once the President-elect is sworn in. But one top Republican seems to have enough of it already.Arizona Sen. John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday that he doesn't like flag burning, which he sees as an insult to his fellow veterans. But he noted that it has been decreed an act of free speech and wouldn't talk about Trump.\"I have not been commenting on Mr. Trump and I will continue not to comment on Mr. Trump,\" McCain said. \"My time is devoted to trying to make sure this nation is secure, not to comment on every comment of Mr. Trump's.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/donald-trump-first-amendment/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump taps Ben Carson for HUD secretary","articleText":" (CNN)Ben Carson will be nominated as the next secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Trump transition team announced Monday. \"I am thrilled to nominate Dr. Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development,\" President-elect Donald Trump said in a statement. \"Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\"During their primary fight, though, Trump had derided Carson as \"super low energy\" and delivered a number of sharp attacks on Twitter, questioning Carson's temperament and qualifications for office.  \"With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?\" Trump tweeted in November of 2015, when he and Carson were still rivals. At a rally in Fort Dodge, Iowa, the same month, Trump had delivered a similarly blistering attack on Carson. \"If you're a child molester, a sick puppy, a child molester, there's no cure for that. There's only one cure, and we don't want to talk about that cure, that's the ultimate cure. No there's two, there's death and the other thing. But if you're a child molester, there's no cure, they can't stop you. Pathological, there's no cure,\" Trump said. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan praised Carson's nomination for HUD secretary.\"@RealBenCarson is a great choice for @HUDgov. A shining example of overcoming poverty, he will put focus on dignity rather than dependence,\" Ryan tweeted. But Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, slammed the pick, calling Carson \"woefully unqualified.\"\"[Trump] has no selected someone woefully unqualififed to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. During his time in Baltimore, Dr. Ben Carson was a phenomenal neurosurgeon, but he has no experience developing housing policy affecting tens of millions of households or running a complex federal agency, as his own spokesman admitted just last month,\" the Maryland representative said in a statement. Cummings was referencing reports that Carson rejected a previous offer from Trump to be the next secretary of Health and Human services because he felt he was too inexperienced to run a federal agency, according to longtime aide Armstrong Williams. Responding to those reports, Williams had said, \"He's never run an agency and it's a lot to ask. He's a neophyte and that's not his strength.\"Carson's unsuccessful primary campaign was punctuated by rookie blunders and odd claims, including that the Egyptian pyramids were used to store grain. \"The pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments,\" he said. \"You wouldn't need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulcher. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.\"He is known for offering provocative commentary on a wide range of issues, including comparing the modern American government to Nazi Germany in a March 2014 interview with Breitbart, and saying at the Voter Values Summit in 2013 that Obamacare is \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"Carson endorsed Trump shortly after he dropped out of the contest, becoming only the second former Republican candidate to do so after Gov. Chris Christie. The secretary of housing and urban development oversees federal public housing programs and helps formulate policy on homelessness and housing discrimination. As is the case with all cabinet secretaries, Carson needs to be confirmed by the Senate.Carson had signaled he would be named to the job Wednesday afternoon, posting on Facebook that an announcement about his forthcoming role in the administration.\"After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\" Carson wrote. \"We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.\"Trump praised Carson as a \"greatly talented person\" in a tweet two weeks ago when he said he was considering Carson for the HUD position.\"I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well -- he's a greatly talented person who loves people!\" Trump tweeted.Trump promised during his campaign to prioritize the restoration of America's inner cities, though he frequently courted controversy by using exaggerated rhetoric that painted a bleak portrait of minority communities. \"The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African-American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city,\" Trump said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, in October. \"We're going to bring safety back. You can't walk out the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. So we're going to work very strongly with the African American community.\"Carson was one of the large field of Republican presidential candidates. He enjoyed an early surge in the polls after he announced his campaign in May 2015 and ran mostly on his biography rather than policy. He bowed out of the race after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday.Carson admits that he had a violent temper in his youth, and says one of the defining moments of his life occurred when he was 14. Carson said he tried to stab a schoolmate, but the boy's belt buckle blocked the knife. After praying for three hours, Carson \"came to an understanding that to lash out at people is not a sign of strength, it was a sign of weakness.\" A CNN report raised questions about Carson's claims that he was violent and angry as a teenager. When Carson -- a famed neurosurgeon -- became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins at age 33, he became the youngest person to head a major division in the hospital's history. His parents separated when he was eight, after it was revealed his father was a bigamist. He and his brother were raised by their mother.The job of HUD secretary became vital after the 2008 housing crisis. President Barack Obama's first pick for the job, Shaun Donovan, oversaw the nearly $14 billion that HUD received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known as the stimulus.Donovan left the job in 2014 and was replaced by Julian Castro, then mayor of San Antonio.The housing secretary also oversees programs that administer mortgage insurance to prospective homeowners and give rental subsidies to lower-income families.CNN's Chris Isidore and Jill Disis contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/ben-carson-hud-secretary-nomination/index.html"}

{"_id":"Trump's America","articleText":"Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from CNN's book, \"Unprecedented.\" Order your copy today at cnn.com/book and explore CNN's coverage of \"A race like no other\" at cnn.com/unprecedented (CNN)Almost everyone thought he would lose. Clinton did. Her vaunted political operatives did. The pollsters did. The #NeverTrump Republicans did. For all his bluster and bold predictions of victory, Trump himself had been worrying all day. He kept pressing aides for information, but they were worried, too. Even his internal models showed him falling short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win.But as the night went on, strange and unexpected numbers flashed across the television screens of America. Early returns put Trump ahead by 3 points in Florida, 10 in Ohio and North Carolina. Virginia was not supposed to be competitive, but Trump had an early lead there, too.\"There isn't panic,\" a Clinton aide said around 8 p.m. Then it was 9, and 10, and the numbers held in Florida and Ohio, and now Trump was leading in Michigan and Wisconsin. Could he crack the Democrats' so-called Blue Wall in the industrial Midwest? Clinton's aides doubted it. They thought he'd missed his chance in Michigan by not campaigning much there until the end. Clinton was so confident about Wisconsin that she never campaigned there at all. She was not so sure about Pennsylvania, which is why she'd hit Philadelphia three times in three days and visited Pittsburgh the previous morning. But now, even in Pennsylvania, her lead narrowed as the night went on. Five points, 4, 3. Something was happening out there, a seismic disruption whose foreshocks nearly all the experts had ignored. By 10:04 p.m., Dow futures had plunged by nearly 500 points. And the wildest campaign in modern history appeared to have one more astonishing twist.As it turned out, the experts' combined wisdom was no match for that of Dave Calabro, also known as Jersey Dave, a 57-year-old South Philadelphian and Trump supporter who thought America had lost its way. He'd acquired his nickname by selling Eagles jerseys in sports bars to provide for his family. He did not always drink beer, but when he did, he usually drank Coors Light. He yelled BLUE LIVES MATTER to cops on Broad Street. He used to love Bruce Springsteen, but now he thought the Boss had disgraced himself by supporting Clinton. Jersey Dave Calabro said it that summer, and kept saying it until Election Day: Trump would carry Pennsylvania, which no Republican had done since 1988, and he would be the next American president.\"The guy never loses,\" Calabro said.There were two Americas in 2016. One had been advancing for a long time. One had been retreating. And on November 8, Trump and his army of Jersey Dave Calabros found a way to reverse the trend.The two Americas were nearly a century in the making. They resulted from women's suffrage, the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement, the gay rights movement and a Hispanic population that increased by roughly 50 million in the last fifty years. These changes had two things in common: They gave power to those who previously had little or none. And they diminished the supremacy of straight white men.Clinton's America was a coalition of these historically disadvantaged groups, along with their white male allies. Year by year, it seemed to align more closely with large corporations and the global elite. It was urban, ascendant, seemingly unstoppable.Its inhabitants saw the last hundred years as a good start, an unfinished march of societal progress. Yes, the nation had same-sex marriage, an African-American president and a number of female chief executives, but this America still felt itself chafing against systemic inequality. Did racism, sexism and homophobia still exist? Of course they did. Clinton's America wanted them eradicated.Trump's America drew in some women and minorities. But much of its energy came from white male grievance. Factories had been closing for decades. Many manufacturing jobs had moved overseas or given way to automation. As wages stagnated, more and more blue-collar men felt themselves working hard and going nowhere. They felt abandoned by the new information economy, swindled by Washington politicians, stifled by the new cultural orthodoxy. Certain men of Trump's America were thrilled when he said, \"Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.\" These men were tired of being blamed for the sins of their fathers, sick of hearing the phrase white guy thrown around like an insult. Wasn't that racism, too? Couldn't there be sexism against men? They felt as if the people of Clinton's America had overtaken them somehow, probably by cheating.Explore more: Unprecedented -- Two Angry Men and Their Disenchanted Armies\"I know I'm the projection for many of those wounded men,\" Clinton once said, as quoted in \"Hillary's Choice,\" a 1999 book by Gail Sheehy. \"I'm the boss they never wanted to have. I'm the wife they never—the wife who went back to school and got an extra degree and a job as good as theirs....It's not me, personally, they hate—it's the changes I represent.\"A year before Clinton's campaign officially began, two allies were emailing about strategy. \"In fact, I think running on her gender would be the SAME mistake as 2008, ie having a message at odds with what voters ultimately want,\" Robby Mook, her eventual campaign manager, wrote in a message later hacked and released by WikiLeaks. \"She ran on experience when voters wanted change....It's also risky because injecting gender makes her candidacy about HER and not the voters and making their lives better.\"But Clinton's America wanted to rally behind the woman who could bring societal progress to its next logical step. If she won, they would all win, at least symbolically, and so the campaign adopted the slogan I'm With Her. On the day she testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in October 2015, online appeals using this slogan helped her raise $133,000 in a single hour.\"I don't want you to vote for me because I'm a woman; I want you to vote for me on the merits,\" she said that year. \"But one of my merits is that I'm a woman.\"Early in 2016, her campaign chairman, John Podesta, received an email that was later released by WikiLeaks. \"I'm a dinosaur to the Democratic Party...white, southern, veteran, male senior,\" wrote Dana Folsom of Augusta, Georgia. \"...I would like to have my ilk shown a tiny bit of respect by the leaders of the Hillary campaign.\"\"You've earned that respect and we'll try to show it,\" Podesta replied.Was Clinton's America big enough for men like Dana Folsom? He did vote for her in the Georgia primary. She added other slogans, such as Fighting for Us and Stronger Together. Still, many blue-collar men were suspicious. Fighting for Us sounded like fighting for the people who were not them, rallying those people against them, and Stronger Together still evoked the progressive union against the way things used to be.\"I'm with you,\" Trump said, and they liked that more than I'm With Her. Her aides marveled at the reams of negative stories about Trump that had no effect. Decorated generals and establishment Republicans joined forces with Clinton to tell the men of Trump's America they were making a huge mistake. But the men ignored the message, because they distrusted the messengers, and because, like Trump, they hated being told no. These rugged individualists who felt their country being stolen were not about to \"listen to reason\" from those they suspected of committing the theft. No, you can't elect someone like Trump? Their campaign slogan might as well have been Yes I Can.You can't vote for a man who insults women and immigrants and Muslims and people with disabilities.Yes I can.You can't vote for a man who boasts about sexually assaulting women.Yes I can.You can't give the nuclear codes to a man who might blow up the world because someone looked at him sideways.Yes I — * * *  Trump's campaign had been declared dead in August, and again in October. Now, if he could somehow control himself, he had a chance to win. \"Stay on point, Donald,\" he said aloud at a rally on November 2. \"Stay on point.\"In the last week of the campaign, he was narrowing the gap. Polls showed him leading in some battleground states, drawing closer in others. Regardless of his intentions, James Comey's letter had given Trump a gift. It had helped unite Republicans against Clinton.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act barring political activity by federal employees. Three former U.S. attorneys general, including two who served under George W. Bush, lashed out at Comey for writing the letter so close to the election. Thirty-six former state attorneys general signed a statement saying Comey's letter contained \"unfair speculation and innuendo.\" His letter infuriated and terrified Clinton supporters, some of whom believed it would cost her the election. When it was over, a top Clinton aide would say it had.Two days before the election, on Sunday, November 6, Comey sent Congress another letter saying the Clinton email investigation was closed again, meaning that she was once again in the clear. * * *    The sky was clear in Florida the final weekend of the race. Inside a warehouse at the state fairgrounds in Tampa, Trump convened his first of four rallies. A sign in the crowd said DOWN WITH THE SWAMP WITCH.He went on to an airport hangar in Wilmington, North Carolina, where two small boys wore rubber Trump masks. \"As you know,\" he said, \"the FBI has reopened its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton.\" This hyperbole led to chants of LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP, and a woman near the press riser said, \"Put Obama in there with her.\" A pale crescent moon hung behind the stage. \"We're winning,\" Trump said. \"We're winning everywhere.\"Analysts thought he was wrong, and that was fine with him. (The polls had also failed to predict Brexit, the United Kingdom's surprising choice that year to leave the European Union, and Trump liked to call himself \"Mr. Brexit.\") Even some operatives in his party thought he was running a terrible campaign: no organization, no ground game, no clue.\"We made a conscious decision to let that narrative continue,\" his deputy campaign manager, Michael Glassner, said in an interview, \"because we believed that it was in our interest for them to underestimate us.\"After Mitt Romney fell short in 2012, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus vowed not to let the Republicans get out-hustled again. The RNC spent more than $175 million to improve its ground game. They had a file of 197 million voters, each scored on a hundred-point scale for their likelihood to vote Republican. And the RNC deployed all these weapons in the service of Trump. Five days before Election Day, the RNC's models showed Trump winning Michigan by two-tenths of a point.He left Wilmington and went on to Nevada. Inside the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, where a young woman wore a pink hat that said DEPLORABLE, he continued his assault on Clinton.\"We didn't bring any so-called stars along—we didn't need them,\" he said, referring to the bevy of celebrities, from Jay-Z to Lady Gaga, who campaigned for Clinton in the final days. Her dazzling cast of surrogates included both Obamas, her ex-president husband, Vice President Biden and her former opponent, Bernie Sanders. In 2016 Trump ran against the Democrats, the Republicans, two political dynasties and the last three presidents. Through the force of his personality, he would defeat them all.Trump would not win by mobilizing an unprecedented coalition of Republicans. (Indeed, at the time of publication, Clinton held a lead in the nationwide popular vote.) He would win because Clinton underperformed Obama's showing in 2008 and 2012.There were chants of U-S-A and LOCK HER UP, and it seemed like a normal Trump rally until someone yelled something about a gun.The sequence began when Trump noticed a protester in the crowd. \"Oh, we have one of those guys from—from the Hillary Clinton campaign,\" he said. \"How much are you being paid? Fifteen hundred dollars?\"He paused, shielding his eyes, looking back into the crowd. Two Secret Service agents ran onto the stage. \"Go, go,\" one of them said, hustling him behind the curtain. People ran for the exits. Officers in tactical gear ran toward the stage. The officers led a man out of the room. The crowd went wild, chanting U-S-A again. The stage was empty for almost four minutes. Then Dan Scavino, Trump's director of social media, took the microphone.\"NOBODY IS GONNA STOP THIS MOVEMENT!\" he shouted.Trump swaggered back out. He let the applause wash over him.\"Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,\" he said. \"But we will never be stopped. Never, ever be stopped.\"The authorities never found a weapon. No arrests were made. Nevertheless, both Scavino and Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a Trump supporter who said, referring to Clinton's rain-shortened rally in Florida, \"Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt.\"The violence that attended the 2016 campaign was unlike anything the nation had seen since the 1960s. There were victims and perpetrators on both sides, although markedly more on the Trump side. Left-wing protesters attacked Trump supporters, stealing their MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hats and setting them ablaze. Someone fire-bombed a Republican Party office in North Carolina. In Mississippi, someone torched an African-American church, leaving the words VOTE TRUMP on the side. And some Trump supporters hinted at further violence if Clinton was elected.\"On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,\" former Congressman Joe Walsh tweeted. \"On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?\"It was an unsettling question, contrary to all protocols of American democracy. But it would be left unanswered. * * *   In late July, Clinton visited Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a desolate city of 20,000 whose welcoming committee included the bearer of a sign that said KILLARY KILLED COAL. Inside Johnstown Wire Technologies, where fine gray dust covered the surfaces, Adam Wisniewski said Johnstown had been so poor for so long that it barely felt the effects of the 2008 recession. He was 38 years old, delivering caskets part-time, and he knew people who sold food stamps to buy sports equipment for their children.Bill Clinton's America once included Johnstown. When he ran for re-election in 1996, the Man from Hope won almost every state in Coal Country and the upper Midwest. Labor unions were stronger then, factory jobs more plentiful, blue-collar white workers more inclined to vote Democratic. Johnstown is in Cambria County, which Bill Clinton won with 51 percent of the vote that year. Twenty years later, this county would help give the presidency to Trump.Explore more: Unprecedented -- The Democrats Try To Capture the FlagHillary Clinton knew she had to reach some of these white working-class voters, but she went about it awkwardly. During a CNN town hall in Ohio on March 13, she was talking about renewable energy and said:\"...We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right? And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people....Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\"What did people remember from that statement? We're going to put a lot of coal miners out of business.\"Her point was, 'I have a plan to help coal miners transition to a new economy,' Clinton's director of speechwriting, Dan Schwerin, said in an interview. \"More than anyone else in the campaign, she has cared and thought about how we can get to working-class white voters in places like Appalachia. It's just a cruel irony that her passion for this subject led to that; it came out in the wrong way with that comment.\"Trump kept it simple. Signs at his convention said TRUMP DIGS COAL. He ran against both Clintons, blaming them for the free-trade agreements that he said were responsible for massive job losses. Their overall effect was closer to neutral, but KILLARY KILLED COAL had a nice ring. When Clinton visited Johnstown, the Trump campaign released a statement comparing it to a \"robber visiting their victim.\" Could Trump actually bring jobs back to Johnstown? Adam Wisniewski didn't think so. To him, Trump's promise was just another drug, like the opioids that killed fifty-three people in Cambria County the previous year.\"People feel so lost today,\" he said. \"They would rather just take the magic pill and go back to sleep.\"All across the industrial Midwest, Hillary Clinton lost counties that had previously voted for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. She lost Cambria County by 38 points, and she lost Pennsylvania.* * *  She had two speeches written, just in case, and as the first results came in she was reviewing them at the hotel suite in Manhattan. Her top aides were there, along with Bill and Chelsea and the grandkids. There was salmon with roasted carrots on the buffet in the hallway, vegan créme brûlée for dessert. The concession speech was a precaution from a woman who liked to be prepared. A mile and a half away at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, other staffers prepared for a victory party. The building had an actual glass ceiling. Cannons would fire green-tinted confetti that resembled shattered glass.\"Thinking about my daughter right now,\" a confident Tim Kaine tweeted at 8:30. \"No little girl will ever again have to wonder whether she, too, can be president.\"Clinton's own mother had been unwanted by her parents. Left to roam the streets of Chicago at age 4. Sent to live with her cruel grandmother at age 8. Turned out on her own at age 14. Her name was Dorothy. She got married, had children, spent her life giving them the home she never had. She took a break from hanging up the clothes to lie in the grass with her daughter and look up at the clouds. Dorothy Rodham died in 2011 at age 92, five years too early to witness this night. Her daughter was running for president a second time, and once again she would come up short.At 11:07 p.m., CNN projected the battleground of North Carolina for Trump.Around 11:20, a young Clinton staffer wiped away tears.Around midnight, with Clinton still sequestered in the hotel, people began leaving the Javits Center. At a bar nearby, a man lay on the floor and wept.The returns kept coming in. Experts had expected Trump to lose, and to drag other Republicans down with him, costing them the Senate and drastically reducing their majority in the House. Instead, his long coattails helped them keep control of both chambers. The experts had been talking all year about chaos in the Republican Party, but it was the Democrats who had fallen apart. Obama's legacy was now in jeopardy, his many executive orders subject to nullification by President Trump, his signature health-care law in danger of being scaled back if not repealed altogether. The new president might choose as many as three or four Supreme Court justices, thus shaping the high court for decades to come and putting Roe v. Wade in question.The Democrats had a candidate who connected with the angry white worker. Some of his rallies were even larger than Trump's. In the primaries he defeated Clinton in both Wisconsin and Michigan, hinting at the vulnerability of her Blue Wall. Head-to-head polls in May showed him leading Trump by as many as 15 points. But the Democrats nominated a status quo candidate when many voters desperately wanted change. And the Clinton campaign ignored the lessons of the primaries, essentially deciding to ignore Wisconsin and avoid Michigan as long as Trump did.Midnight turned to 1 and 2, with Clinton nowhere to be seen. The race had not been officially called, but it was clearly over. Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, addressed the weary faithful at the Javits Center.\"Several states are too close to call,\" he said on live television, provoking chants of LOCK HER UP at the Trump victory party about twenty blocks away. \"...You should get some sleep.\"Shortly after 2:30 a.m., Clinton called Trump to concede and offer congratulations. CNN called the race at 2:48. Trump took the microphone at 2:49 to chants of U-S-A. Despite his many previous threats, he said nothing about locking her up.\"Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,\" he said. \"I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\"For all the uproar over the racial tension he stirred, exit polls showed that Trump captured 8 percent of the black and 29 percent of the Latino vote, slightly better than Romney had in 2012. Clinton could not quite re-create the Obama coalition. She fell short among both minorities and young voters, as well as white working-class voters in the Midwest.And while she won women overall by 12 points, she lost white women by 10 points.Later, Clinton's allies would blame Comey for lower-than-expected turnout—and for her loss. They had seen encouraging trends in early voting before October 28, particularly among minorities. But on Election Day itself, Clinton did not hit her targets.\"If you were on the fence, and you were repelled by Trump and open to her, and the Comey letter happens, and you were reminded of the emails, a lot of people decided, 'Never mind,'\" a senior adviser told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"And it killed the mood among minority voters.\"Next morning she had to face the cameras. At a ballroom in the New Yorker hotel, nearly all her top aides teared up. Her husband worked the rope line, wiping away tears. This would be one of the hardest things she had ever done.A concession speech can be more important than a victory speech, and this concession speech was more important than any in recent memory. Clinton had just lost to a man she considered temperamentally unfit for the presidency. Her political career was probably over. The hopes of tens of millions of women were dashed. \"A piece of me died last night,\" her supporter Ruth Ellis wrote in an email. Clinton had come so far, gotten so close, and it might be a long time before voters gave a woman another chance. Her own mother had died waiting for the first woman president, and no one knew how many others would do the same. She said the glass ceiling would shatter one day, a reference to her concession speech from eight years earlier. She told her followers not to lose heart. And she told them to give Trump a chance.\"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country,\" Clinton said. \"I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.\"She lingered on the word all, making the emphasis unmistakable. It sounded like a challenge, and maybe a prayer.Protests broke out that night in several major cities. In Los Angeles, young Latinos kindled a piñata in the shape of Trump's head and chanted, NOT MY PRESIDENT! NOT MY PRESIDENT! But he was, or would be soon. He would not just preside over the roughly 60 million people who voted for him. He would preside over the slightly larger number who did not. He would preside over the flag-wavers on the plains of Iowa and the flag-burners on the streets of New York. He would preside over Jersey Dave Calabro, Khizr Khan, the young men and women in Los Angeles who gave his effigy a crown of fire. Now he had the power he wanted. It was time to bring together the nation he had helped to drive apart.Explore more from CNN's Unprecedented: The Surprises of October and Faith and Doubt in a Divided States of America.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/applenews-unprecedented-trump-america/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump's Romney romance could be one big setup","articleText":"S.E. Cupp is the author of \"Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \"Why You're Wrong About the Right\" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, or, in an equally Shakespearean enclave, Trump World. I have a sinking feeling that Donald Trump's courtship of Mitt Romney is a setup meant to eventually embarrass the one-time Never Trumper on a massive scale. When it was first floated that the President-elect and his transition team were considering Romney for Secretary of State, it seemed like a far-fetched idea or, at best, a trial balloon meant to gauge Romney's footing amongst Trump Republicans. After all, Romney was the guy who, voluntarily and unprompted, reemerged from private life to call Trump a fraud and a phony who was unfit to be president.  Few were more vocal -- and less effective -- in their opposition to Trump's candidacy. And in return, Trump continually mocked Romney as a choke artist. These guys weren't meant to brush it off and bro-hug after this was finished. And yet, there they were, sipping on non-alcoholic beverages, munching high-priced vittles and smiling for the cameras at Jean Georges restaurant in Trump's hotel in New York City. It was the second meeting between the former rivals, and one that Romney raved about afterward. Immediately following the meal he took to the lobby of Trump International Hotel to greet the press. \"I happen to think that America's best days are ahead of us,\" he said. \"I think you're going to continue to see America continue to lead the world in this century.\" He also said he was \"impressed\" with Trump's transition and Cabinet appointments. \"All of those things combined gives me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\" It's certainly a stunning about-face from Romney, but it's also a puzzling move by Trump. Forgetting the personality clashes between these two men, Romney's and Trump's foreign policies are very, very different. In 2012, Romney outlined plans to open US markets to Asian economies, reducing tariffs and increasing trade. While a vocal opponent of illegal immigration, his \"self-deportation\" idea was a stark contrast to Trump's talk of a \"deportation force.\" Romney also supported looser immigration laws to attract highly skilled workers from other countries. On Islamic extremism, Romney advocated for military intervention in places where Al Qaeda was operating and even suggested sending forces to places like Bali and Pakistan to train local populations to fight jihadists. Romney called Russia and Vladimir Putin, who Trump has praised, America's \"number one geopolitical foe.\"  It's hard to imagine Romney and Trump bridging any of these serious divides, which would be a pretty obvious problem if Romney were to head up the State Department under a President with whom he disagrees on nearly every position and policy. The other oddity is that Romney's competition isn't getting nearly the same treatment. When is Rudy Giuliani's photo op? When does David Petraeus get frogs' legs and diver scallops?  The non-cynical answer would be that Trump is seriously considering Romney and wants to signal publicly that he's leaning in his direction while calming the detractors who think they couldn't possibly get along. But I'm not buying it. The whole thing reeks of a Stephen King prom night setup that ends with Trump dumping a bucket of pig's blood onto Romney's head. Knowing Trump's obsession with loyalty and his penchant for revenge -- he once tweeted the Alfred Hitchcock quote \"Revenge is sweet and not fattening\" -- it's totally plausible that this is just an elaborate plan to embarrass Romney for his opposition. \"Get even with people,\" Trump once said in a speech. \"If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard.\"  I'm not alone in my suspicion. I talked to a Romney insider who also is worried this flirtation is all being staged to eventually pull the rug out from under him.  I hope I'm wrong. I hope Trump is sincere and that the seriousness of running the country has sobered and humbled him. And if he does pass on Romney, I hope he does it with dignity, respect and generosity. But something tells me the third act of this drama will end very, very badly.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/opinions/trump-romney-romance-setup-cupp/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump's challenge: Solving the Middle East's many problems ","articleText":"Editor's note: CNN International Correspondent Ben Wedeman has lived on and off in the Middle East since the 1970s and has covered the region extensively. (CNN)The next US President will have a lot of global challenges to deal with, and the Middle East is one of them. Here's what you need to know. Trump on the Middle East\"If I become President, the era of nation-building will be ended. Our new approach, which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas, and by our friends in the Middle East, must be to halt the spread of Radical Islam,\" Trump announced in a foreign policy speech in August.The non Americans' guide to US electionsOne map that sums up the Middle EastThere are four active wars in the Middle East -- Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya -- and the US is involved to varying degrees in all of them. And where there isn't full-scale war, there is profound uncertainty. In Egypt, the economy is in steep decline and the regime of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is waging a low level battle against an affiliate of ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula. Israel is never far from launching yet another war on Gaza (there have been three in the past seven years).Turkey has locked up or dismissed tens of thousands of policemen, soldiers, teachers and other government employees in the aftermath of the failed July 15 coup, is fighting Kurdish separatists, has intervened in Syria and is threatening to join the fight against ISIS in Iraq against the wishes of the government in Baghdad. Saudi Arabia is facing huge financial troubles, thanks to falling oil prices and a lack of other significant sources of income. All of the above have created an atmosphere of profound instability, which is why hundreds of thousands of people are trying to flee to Europe.To sum it up, the Middle East is a mess (partially due to Western meddling, it must be stressed) devoid of easy solutions.Opinion: The world is watching America's electionWhat is Trump's top Middle East priority in the first 100 days? Trump should conduct a thorough review of US policy on the Middle East since 1945 -- what went right (very little) and what went wrong (just about everything). What worked was the softer approach, focusing on education and trade. What has not worked is military intervention, regime change, and grand schemes to reshape the region.He will have a big job getting up to speed on the Middle East, and the State Department and Pentagon will have to brief him on international law and military strategy. No, you can't keep Iraq's oil, and no, \"bombing the s***\" out of ISIS (whatever that means) isn't going to fix anything.Can Trump fix this in the first term?No. Not in the first term, not in the foreseeable future. If the lessons of the last decades are anything to go by, the \"solution\" to one problem usually means the creation of another. Saddam Hussein was perceived as a \"problem,\" so President George W. Bush led the \"Coalition of the Willing\" to depose him, and now we have ISIS. The US, its allies, and Iraqi forces are dealing with ISIS -- but having spent copious amounts of time in Iraq in recent years, I have yet to meet a single person who labors under the delusion that peace and prosperity will follow the terror group's demise. Syria is, if anything, even more intractable.And then there is poor Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, the richest countries in the Arab world, are busy mauling it with US and Western-made weapons as they fight a proxy war with Iran. On the Israel-Palestinian question, one administration after another has exerted half-hearted efforts to resolve the conflict, to no avail.Look, US policy in the Middle East is not working. Post-1945 US involvement in the region has been a disaster, post-9/11 even worse. Something has to change. My advice to Trump is: Pull back. Stop messing around in the region. Focus on what has worked in the past, like education and trade. Stop selling obscene amounts of weaponry to regimes that use them to fuel wars. The job of President of the United States is a thankless one, and when it comes to the Middle East, a hopeless one as well. How big a priority is the Middle East for CNN readers?A big one -- Syria was the top international priority according to a very unscientific poll of CNN readers who took part in our interactive feature on the 10 biggest global challenges facing the next President. Iran was fourth and Iraq came in sixth. What's your biggest priority for the next President? Take our quiz and let us know.

{"_id":"Trump's choice for education secretary raises questions","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos and her husband are major political power brokers in their home state of Michigan. The two are major Republican donors -- they've contributed a total of $50,000 dollars to the campaigns of senators whose votes she'll need to be approved as a nominee -- and in Michigan, they've spent millions of dollars over the years to lobby for big changes to Michigan schools, among other issues.In 2010, they even opened up their own charter school on the grounds of the Gerald R. Ford Airport in Grand Rapids, which kids flock to from 40 school districts. But her legacy here is not all flattering, especially in Detroit, where educators on both sides of the aisle say her push for school choice and a free market for charter schools has not worked for Michigan kids.\"When I hear her name and I think about education, I think about choice without quality,\" said Tonya Allen, president and CEO of the Skillman Foundation, and a member of a coalition to help fix Detroit schools.Who could be in Trump's Cabinet?Detroit is the lowest performing big city in the country, but over the last 15 years, the entire state of Michigan has declined when it comes to student performance. And many say the push to deregulate charter schools -- who can open them, close them, and where they can be placed -- has played a major role in that downward turn.Nearly half of charter schools here are ranked in the bottom of American schools, according to the Education Trust Midwest. Twenty percent were given a \"D\" or \"F\" grade. And 80 percent of charter schools in the state are now operating as for-profit institutions. \"We focused on the proliferation of choice and creating as many charters as we could as quickly as we could, rather than focusing on whether the schools that we were going to open were going to be high quality,\" Allen said. Take, for example, 11-year-old Judah Shelton. He has ADHD and was struggling in overcrowded public schools. By the end of the 3rd grade, he couldn't even write his own name. By the time he was in the 5th grade, Judah had been to four different schools. His mom finally found school that worked for him but that school is 35 minutes away from their house. \"It's somebody else's neighborhood that I'm traveling to while passing three or four other schools and about six or seven closed schools to get to his school in a neighborhood that I don't live in,\" his mom, Arlyssa Heard said. In Detroit, which has been plagued by decades of bad public schools, there is bipartisan support for charter schools. But there also bipartisan agreement that school choice here is not working. \"It's not working for Detroit children, it's not working for Michigan children, and I would dare say it's not going to work for the nation's children,\" Allen said. \"I would be really concerned if Michigan was the road map for the country. I actually think that we should be looking at Michigan and say, this is what we should not do.\"Donald Trump's dramatic search for a secretary of stateA lot of the blame has fallen to Betsy DeVos. \"In Michigan she's viewed as the architect of the Detroit system for better or worse and obviously I and many others believe it's for worse,\" said Aaron Pallas, professor of sociology and education at Columbia University's Teachers College, \"I think it's very much a market mechanism argument.\"Since 2015, members of the DeVos family have given more than $2.6 million dollars in contributions to the Michigan Republican party and other candidates and political organizations in the state alone. Many here say that's had a significant influence on education reform.In 1994, the DeVos family was instrumental in passing legislation that attached funding to the student instead of the school district. The idea that money follows the student began to fail when the student population started to decline, but the number of schools kept rising. Now schools -- public and charter -- are in bidding wars to attract kids and the money they bring, leading to campaigns to attract students with iPads, bicycles, and gift cards, often times in poor neighborhoods around the holidays. In 2011, the DeVos' education advocacy group -- the Great Lakes Education Project -- successfully lobbied for legislation that removed the cap on the number of charter schools and the number of organization that could operate them. Michigan now lets more entities open charters than most other states. The result is that kids in charters in Detroit perform slightly better than kids in public school, but all are still well below the national average.\"We believe that there are certain elements of the charter schools in the city of Detroit that need more accountability,\" said John Rakolta, a businessman who also sat on the committee to improve Detroit schools. Rakolta, a vocal Trump supporter, acknowledged that he and DeVos were on opposite sides of some issues over the future of Detroit's schools but he supports her nomination and thinks that she'll do a good job for kids. He said that over the years, she's been a good advocate, even when they don't agree.Donald Trump to nominate James Mattis for secretary of defenseBut not all are so cordial about some of the ideological disagreements.\"Worst case scenario is that Michigan is representative of the future of the rest of the country as well,\" said Pallas. And deregulation is certainly on Donald Trump's agenda.Gary Naeyaert, executive director of GLEP, of which DeVos served as a board member until last week, said she isn't to blame for Michigan's failing schools. He said Detroit has long struggled with public education and charters have only helped students. \"Are we satisfied with the education product that's coming out of Michigan? I would say that we are not,\" Naeyaert said. \"What we have is a lot of people, a lot of chefs in the kitchen, but not a clear consensus on what we want to achieve as a state in terms of education.\" He also says that DeVos is the perfect person for secretary of education if Donald Trump intends to keep his campaign promise of eventually eliminating the Department of Education.\"I think it's safe to say that her reputation and experience as an outsider in terms of the traditional education infrastructure reinforces his position that we're going to be doing things differently in the future than we have been doing them in the past, and I would say to people hold onto your seats.\"CNN's Curt Devine contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/politics/betsy-devos-michigan-education-legacy/index.html"}

The Trump camp did not immediately respond to CNN's questions on the research.The findings have sparked interest as President-elect Trump vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in his election campaign.\"Trump talks against illegal immigration, so I think he should remember his own family story from time to time,\" Paul said.Trump proposed a wall be built between the US and Mexico as the centerpiece of his anti-immigration drive. He has also threatened to deport or even jail undocumented migrants. 'Trump wouldn't exist'Paul came across the document on Friedrich Trump's threatened deportation in state archives and also found several letters from him pleading with authorities to allow him to stay. Paul mused on how this one administrative decision seemed to have changed the course of history.\"I have to say this kind of letter wasn't unusual back then,\" Paul told CNN.\"But if they had accepted him back at that time in 1905, Donald Trump wouldn't be in the US -- in fact, he wouldn't exist.\"He said the eight week deadline was extended as Friedrich Trump said that his daughter was ill. But he was finally forced to leave two months later. Trump's father was born in the US, where he met Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who hailed from Scotland.Paul, now retired, carried out his research earlier this year when he was Director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore in Kaiserslautern, but his research caught public attention on Monday when the tabloid Bild published his findings.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/trump-grandfather-germany-friedrich/index.html"}

{"_id":"Trump's pick for national security adviser once bashed torture, drone strikes, night raids","articleText":" (CNN)Donald Trump's pick for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, has in past interviews strongly criticized torture, drone strikes, and night raids conducted by the U.S. Army. The more moderate views expressed by Flynn in the past run counter to the president-elect's, who has repeatedly said he will bring back waterboarding and go even further in questioning suspected terrorists. Trump has not laid out a detailed view on how he would approach drone warfare, but he has suggested he would increase airstrikes against ISIS and once said he would \"take out\" the families of terrorists. Top contender for defense secretary faces legal issueFlynn did not respond to a request for an interview on how he would advise the president-elect on these issues. Speaking at Carnegie Council in December 2014, Flynn condemned the use of torture, saying it was against American values. \"I'll tell you what, I think it's very dangerous for a time, because it exposes the United States to something that we -- I think history will look back on it and it won't be a pretty picture, regardless of all the people that you have heard in the media, what they have said,\" Flynn said. \"I think it was pretty telling -- I caught a little bit of Senator Feinstein's statement on the Hill today, and I was able to read Senator McCain's response. I would encourage all of you to read Senator McCain's response. Senator Feinstein was incredibly articulate about why the report -- I was interested to see what the other side would say. In this case, I thought Senator McCain's very thoughtful -- from an individual who really experienced enormous levels of torture himself -- what his response was going to be.\"\"If there's an American strategic advantage, it is our values. We must protect our values at all costs,\" he added.In June, Trump asked a crowd in Ohio, \"What do you think about waterboarding?\"\"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he added.Earlier this year, Flynn acknowledged he'd be okay with \"enhanced interrogation\" with \"certain limits\" if the nation was in grave danger of a terrorist attack. But, in an interview with Mehdi Hasan of al-Jazeera in August 2015, Flynn again said history would look poorly on the US for using torture.Trump: 'Mad Dog' Mattis is a 'very impressive' candidate for defense secretary\"History is not gonna look kind on the -- on those actions that you're describing right now, and we will be held, we should be held accountable for many, many years to come,\" he said. In the same interview, Flynn noted the US would need to invest more in solutions to terrorism, like fixing poor social and economic conditions. \"I think that we have invested in, in more conflict instead of actually investing in solutions. So, and when I say that, what I mean is that we invest in more drones, we invest in more bombs, we invest in more weapons, we invest in more ammunition, we invest in more guys to go out and kill more guys. That's investing in conflict, instead of really taking a serious look and say, 'What ... what are the big excuses that these guys are using?' And if it's lack of, you know, if it's poor economic conditions, if it's poor social conditions, then let's fix those. But those kinds of things aren't gonna get fixed overnight. And the leaders of the Middle East have to decide that that's what they want to do.\"Flynn later said in the interview with Hasan that night raids and drone strikes created more terrorists than they kill.\"Well, maybe another show, but the drone strikes for example, many have argued, they create more terrorists than they kill. The night raids in Afghanistan, many have argued they create more terrorists than they get,\" asked Hasan.\"Yeah, I don't disagree, I don't disagree with that. I think that that's -- that's conflict. When you invest in conflict -- when you drop a bomb from a drone, you're investing, you are gonna cause more damage than you're gonna cause good,\" he said. \"And think that there should be a different approach, absolutely. Absolutely.\"Flynn also agreed with the assessment that prison systems were creating more terrorists and worsening the problem by radicalizing more potential terrorists.\"Yeah, there's no, there's no doubt -- there's no doubt that the prison system that was, that was the Iraqi prison system, became, you know, places, training ground, the training ground for what we're facing today,\" Flynn said.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/politics/kfile-flynn-on-torture/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump's plan to deport criminals won't be easy. Just ask Obama","articleText":" (CNN)Donald Trump has vowed to kick off his presidency by swiftly kicking out one segment of the immigrant population: criminals.But that's exactly what the Obama administration says it's been doing for eight years. More than 2.4 million people have been deported under President Barack Obama, earning him the scathing nickname of \"deporter in chief\" among some immigrant advocacy groups. Nearly half of those removals were immigrants with criminal convictions, an explicit priority of the administration.Though Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, critics question whether he'll be able to accelerate deportations much. Some experts say there are bottlenecks in the system that prevented Obama from deporting more immigrants.Obama and Trump clearly don't see eye to eye on many aspects of immigration. Obama backs a pathway to citizenship. Trump plans to build a wall on the southern border. But there's one area where they agree. When it comes to the issue of deporting criminals, even their rhetoric sounds similar.Here's Obama's take on whom authorities should focus on deporting:And here's what Trump said this month: A NEW APPROACH?But Trump and his supporters accuse Obama of deliberately dragging his feet.The President-elect says his focus will be tracking down and kicking out immigrants who are criminals and should have been deported already. And he says there could be up to 3 million. \"We're getting them out of our country. They're here illegally,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"Trump's number is higher than other figures analysts have used. The nonprofit Migration Policy Institute estimates 820,000 undocumented immigrants have criminal convictions.So where does the statistic Trump's using come from? Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who's advising Trump on immigration, says the President-elect was looking at a Department of Homeland Security report from 2013, which used census figures to estimate there could be up to 1.9 million \"removable criminal aliens\" in the United States. \"That report's 3 years old, so President-elect Trump would be saying, 'It's probably gone up,' \" Kobach told CNN.DEFINING CRIMINALOfficial reports on deportations describe immigrants with convictions as criminal aliens. But exactly what that term means depends on whom you ask. Data about whom the US government has deported in recent years shows that the term can apply to immigrants who've committed a wide range of crimes. Government data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, a data research group at Syracuse University, found the two most prevalent crimes of those removed in recent years were immigration and traffic offenses. Drug crimes came in third.\"Criminal aliens\" can be undocumented immigrants or lawful permanent residents. They may have gotten caught up in the court system for a shoplifting offense -- or served lengthy prison sentences for something much more severe.As officials trumpet the priority of kicking out criminals, why would traffic offenses take up such a large share of the criminal deportations on the books?\"Going after those with 'traffic-related' offenses helped (immigration officials) at least nominally look as if they were achieving their announced goals of deporting serious criminals from our midst,\" says Susan Long, co-director of TRAC.Another possibility: Authorities are using the courts to prosecute immigration law violations more than they used to do. \"Formerly, individuals were deported administratively, and infrequently sent through the criminal justice system,\" Long says.Immigrations and Customs Enforcement told CNN that the agency changed priorities in 2014. Under current policies, traffic offenses and local immigration offenses are not a priority for deportation. As a result, ICE says it is now better targeting people who pose a national security or public safety threat.Trump and his supporters have slammed immigration officials under the Obama administration for being too lenient, alleging officials released criminals they could have deported. Immigrant rights advocates have pointed out that there's a big difference between shoplifting and a sex crime, accusing officials of painting with too broad a brush and splitting up families with rash deportation decisions. A looming question: Where will Trump draw the line?\"I think you'll see probably a Trump administration saying, 'Look, we're going to define criminal broadly and not so narrowly,' \" Kobach told CNN this month.OBSTACLES LOOMNo matter what guidelines Trump uses, it's likely deporting millions of people won't be as simple as it sounds.Local governments known as \"sanctuary cities\" across the country are already gearing up for a battle, vowing not to work with federal immigration officials who are searching for undocumented immigrants to deport.\"We're not going to tear families apart. So we will do everything we know how to do to resist that,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said after Trump's election.Trump has vowed to fight back with federal funding cuts. No matter what happens next, sparring over the matter is likely to slow any massive deportation efforts.And immigration courts are already backlogged, with more than half a million cases on the docket and fewer than 300 judges to hear them. The average wait time for a case in immigration court is 670 days -- nearly half the length of a presidential term.Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute says that deportations are expensive, and without substantially new funds from Congress, the system can't handle much more.

{"_id":"Trump's transition rollercoaster ride","articleText":" (CNN)Donald Trump's campaign was entirely unconventional, and his transition to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is proving to be just that.Trump announced Friday that he has chosen key members of his national security team, including CIA director, attorney general and national security advisor. Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas has been selected for CIA director. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has been offered the job of national security advisor and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions has been picked for attorney general. All three have accepted their offers.The news followed signs on Thursday that the weight of the presidency is beginning to sink in for Trump, and that the President-elect may be shifting from the bomb-throwing tactics he employed during the campaign to a more nuanced approach.The President-elect held his first meeting with a world leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on Thursday. It was a most unusual setup -- arranged without any formal briefing for Trump from the State or Defense departments.The chaotic nature of the Trump transition continues to give jitters to Democrats, some Republicans in Washington, as well as allies in governments around the world. For months, diplomats and world leaders have watched Trump deliver incendiary speeches on the campaign trail with wariness and trepidation. But Abe spoke positively about the meeting afterwards, calling it a candid conversation and saying he believed they could form a relationship of mutual respect.Trump also arranged meetings with Republicans who were among his fiercest critics, a display of normalcy after a week of upheaval and apparent chaos for his transition team. First, he replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been overseeing the transition, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and subsequently purged lobbyists from the ranks, in keeping with his vow to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.Then there was the lightning rod announcement of former Breitbart chief executive Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser -- which sent shockwaves through activist groups who view the Breitbart site as racist and anti-Semitic.Thursday, more conventional Republican faces began appearing at Trump Tower as the team continued vetting potential Cabinet members and advisers at a furious pace, with literally thousands of government positions to fill within a very short window of time.Trump met with foreign policy heavyweight Henry Kissinger, as well as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and one-time critic South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who are both under serious consideration for Cabinet jobs.In perhaps the most surprising news, Trump plans to meet this weekend in New Jersey with 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who was one of Trump's most vociferous critics during the campaign (calling him a phony, and a fraud, and skewering him on Twitter for the way in which he talked about women on a leaked \"Access Hollywood\" tape). Romney may be considered for a Cabinet post -- possibly secretary of state -- though sources close to the former Massachusetts governor say he has not actively sought a role in the Trump administration and merely agreed to meet with Trump as a gesture of good faith. Establishment Republicans viewed the more recent developments with relief on Thursday -- a signal that Trump may be giving more serious thought to addressing the deep fissures in his party.Trump's outreach to Haley and Romney, seemed to demonstrate a possible willingness to assemble a team of rivals in his government -- which would be a surprising pivot for a man who wrote in his 1997 book \"The Art of the Comeback\" that one of his maxims was to \"get even\" and that he believed \"in an eye for an eye. World is watchingMany world leaders were eager to make contact with him after his surprising victory last week. But with Trump's own team in transition, that was no easy feat. For example, Trump was connected with the Australian prime minister, sources told CNN, by a mutual acquaintance, golfer Greg Norman, who happened to have his phone number.Several diplomats told CNN that they reached out to Trump Tower to schedule congratulatory calls for their head of state. . Once the calls were arranged, they were connected without being asked for any verification of their identities or measures to verify the authenticity of the call.Some diplomats who had set up meetings with transition team members for the coming days discovered those officials were gone as part of this past week's purge of Christie's team and anyone registered as a lobbyist.Amidst the initial confusion about who was in charge, one diplomat wondered whether to reach out directly to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is one of his closest advisers, or his daughter Ivanka Trump.Having been elected without any prior government experience, Trump's conversations unsurprisingly are bucking traditional diplomatic protocol The Times of London reported on a leaked transcript of Trump's call with British Prime Minister Theresa May, where Trump reportedly offered her the most casual of invitations to meet with him: \"If you travel to the US, you should let me know.\"'A certain amount of chaos'After Trump's White House meeting with President Barack Obama, there also was a lapse in communication with the current agency personnel who will ensure a smooth transition of power.That problem -- delays created by Trump's team not getting paperwork and a list of names to the White House -- appeared to be corrected Thursday when a transition official reported that four teams -- from the Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and National Security Council -- have been connected with the proper agency points of contact.While Trump's team has come under a hail of criticism this week, both Democratic and Republican officials who have been involved in past transition planning cautioned that a fair amount of chaos was to be expected, particularly given that many of Trump's own advisers did not expect him to win. Presidents-elect generally don't announce major nominees like Secretary of State within nine days of the election anyway.\"Lots of reasons to be concerned about @realDonaldTrump transition,\" former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted, \"but the pace of announcements isn't one of them. That's not a fair shot.\"\"We hadn't made any major appointments at this point in 2008,\" Axelrod added. \"I don't remember being criticized for it.\"Lanhee Chen, a former Romney advisor and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said it was hard to judge at this early stage whether things were going more or less smoothly than they did under Obama or President George W. Bush, even though the teams of those two candidates were highly organized and ready to deploy as soon as they clinched victory.  \"There's a certain amount of chaos that is built into every transition,\" Chen said. \"There always is this challenge of meshing campaign staff with transition staff with campaign staff. If Governor Romney had won in 2012, I think that there would have been some issues to sort through as well.\"\"Some of this is part of a natural process,\" said Chen, a CNN contributor. \"It's important to keep in mind that the Republican Party was pretty divided throughout this election, and part of what we are seeing is an effort, not just to build a new administration, but to heal some of the wounds from that fight.\"  CNN's Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/trump-transition-rollercoaster-ride/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump-Romney meeting another wild 2016 twist","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Forget a \"Team of Rivals.\" This would be a double act of denouncers.The thought that Mitt Romney would ever join the Cabinet of Donald Trump -- given their hostility, mutual contempt and venomous rhetorical exchanges -- might be the most absurd notion yet of a crazy political year.But the possibility that Trump and the man he labeled a \"choke artist\" could find common cause in the new administration was nonetheless a hot topic ahead of their meeting Saturday at the President-elect's Bedminster, New Jersey, golf retreat.The 2012 Republican nominee, who once warned in a CNN interview that a Trump presidency would mean \"trickle-down racism\" and \"trickle-down bigotry\" instead sat down with Trump and discussed the job of secretary of state, an appointment that would make Hillary Clinton's decision to serve in the same post under her 2008 primary rival Barack Obama seem routine in comparison.After the meeting, Romney offered no hint as to whether he was offered or would accept a role in Trump's administration.\"We had a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance. We discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics,\" Romney said in brief remarks to reporters. He did not take questions.Vice President-elect Mike Pence confirmed Sunday that Romney is under \"active consideration\" for secretary of state.\"The President-elect was very grateful that Gov. Mitt Romney came in. They had a good meeting. It was a warm and substantive exchange. I know he is under active consideration to be secretary of state of the United States along with some other distinguished Americans,\" Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"But the possibility that Trump and the man he labeled a \"choke artist\" could find common cause in the new administration is a hot topic after their weekend meeting at the President-elect's Bedminster, New Jersey, golf retreat.On Sunday night, a Trump transition source said the selection of Romney as secretary of state is \"possible.\"Intrigue surrounds meetingProminent members of Romney's orbit, while not confirming that the former Massachusetts governor is interested in running US diplomacy, are not entirely dismissing the notion that he could agree to serve.\"One of the things that drives Gov. Romney is a sense of duty, and I think that sense of duty is what's driving him to help President-elect Trump in any way he can as he puts together a government,\" Kevin Madden said Friday on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"I think he recognizes that there is that type of outreach going on with President-elect's transition team.\"On the face of it, there are plenty of reasons why the 2012 nominee would refuse to serve alongside Trump, not least because of their sharply different characters and positions on some key foreign policy issues.But there are enough reasons why it might make sense for both men to lend their meeting plenty of intrigue.For the President-elect, Romney would bring an immediate burst of knowledge, global credibility, sound temperament and competence to his nascent administration.His selection would also be seen as a genuine gesture to bind the wounds in the Republican Party and the foreign policy establishment left over from a bitter primary campaign.It could also open the floodgates for the kind of credible, experienced GOP foreign policy insiders whom Trump needs to staff crucial, lower-ranking national security jobs to join the administration.And since Trump's core voters are more concerned with \"draining the swamp\" of well-known Washington insiders than foreign policy, the State Department may be one place he could put an establishment figure and not sustain much political damage.\"Mr. Romney would be a great choice in a sense that would be a signal sent to moderates as well as conservatives,\" William Cohen, a former US defense secretary, told CNN International's Hala Gorani on Friday.\"Whether that is a realistic thing remains to be seen -- I am skeptical but nonetheless remain hopeful that such an appointment, or people like Mitt Romney would be considered.\"Some of Romney's closest advisers initially expressed surprise at the news that the two men would meet. But some told CNN's Gloria Borger that the former venture capitalist prized his duty to his country above all else. Others noted that though he is known as a businessman, Romney's true interests centered on foreign policy, and that secretary of state would be the only Cabinet position he would accept. Another friend however expressed extreme skepticism Romney would join the Trump Cabinet.Romney could be relief to US alliesFor sure, a Romney appointment would come as a great relief to US allies who are deeply anxious about the direction of Trump's foreign policy, and who see alternative names floated for secretary of state such as Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton with much greater apprehension.That's because Romney is squarely within the parameters of accepted US foreign policy orthodoxy, is an internationalist, is well-known abroad and is committed to the notion of free trade, US alliances and a robust US posture in the world.Trump on the other hand has raised doubts about the bedrock pacts of the international system such as NATO and US alliances in Asia, is yet to define his \"America First\" creed and has spooked Eastern European allies with his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump's temperament and a campaign in which opponents said he was unfit to control the nuclear codes also alarmed foreign policy elites and governments abroad -- so the thought of someone as sober and self-controlled as Romney beside Trump in the Situation Room would calm some nerves.The former governor would sail through Senate confirmation, thanks to his reputation as a devoted and devout family man with no personal skeletons.No one can know what is in Romney's mind. But Saturday's meeting was not one he had to take. After all, it carried the risk that the President-elect is simply using his good name to give the impression that he is casting a wide and conciliatory net across his party as he chooses his Cabinet.Career capperBut were Trump to offer him the job of secretary of state, it's not impossible Romney would accept.It would be one last chance to serve and cap a career that once seemed headed for the pinnacle of national politics and at least would partially make up for the disappointment of his loss to Obama four years ago.Given Trump's lack of experience in foreign policy, and a leadership style that promises to be heavily reliant on his subordinates, Romney could see the chance of wide autonomy in setting US foreign policy as attractive.It might also be a good fit with the Mr. Fix-it brand of the former venture capitalist who rescued the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.Still, there's a reason why a Romney nomination as secretary of state would be seen as yet another shocking development in 2016.Trump eviscerated Romney on the campaign trail. He said he was a \"disaster as a candidate\" who \"choked like a dog\" and said he had a lot of friends -- but Romney wasn't one of them. But maybe Trump appreciates someone who can throw a punch. After all, Romney warned Trump was a \"phony,\" a \"fraud\" who was playing the American public for \"suckers\" and once said he wanted to be able to look his grandchildren in the eye and say he took a stand against the GOP nominee.Would Romney be allowed to speak for the President?Even if the two men put personal animosity aside, the starchy Romney would be an incongruous figure in a team that includes firebrands such as new White House adviser Stephen Bannon and the next national security adviser Michael Flynn.And even if Trump gave him broad latitude to dictate US foreign policy, Romney would be taking a risk that the 45th President's intemperate public comments and volatile personality would undo painstaking diplomatic work.There is nothing more debilitating for a secretary of state than the view around the world that he or she does not speak for the President or is on a different page.Similarly, Romney might also face having his own words turned against him in talks with a foreign power since he said this year that the President-elect's promises were \"as worthless as a degree from Trump University.\"Donald Trump settles Trump University lawsuitsRomney and Trump would begin any partnership estranged in some key areas of policy. The former Massachusetts governor is a committed free trader for example. He warned in 2012 that Russia represented the top geopolitical threat to the United States. Trump has meanwhile warmly praised the leadership of Putin and promised to ease rocky relations with the Kremlin.Still Trump and Romney do agree on the need to battle Islamic extremism, the magnitude of the threat from terrorism and the need to hike military spending.Lanhee Chen, a top aide to Romney in 2012, argued that though there were differences on trade, the gaps were perhaps not as wide as they might seem.\"I do think there is some similarity in a focus on American interests that both Gov. Romney and I think Donald Trump expressed on the campaign trail,\" said Chen, a CNN contributor.\"If you look at the atmospherics, the macro level, there may actually be more there than meets the eye in terms of commonality between things that Donald Trump has expressed and Gov. Romney has expressed.\"CNN's Jim Acosta, Eric Bradner, Jeremy Diamond, Mark Preston, Gloria Borger, Jamie Gangel and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/politics/donald-trump-mitt-romney-secretary-of-state/index.html"}
{"_id":"Trump: 'Mad Dog' Mattis is a 'very impressive' candidate for defense secretary","articleText":"Bedminster, New Jersey (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday he was considering retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to serve as his secretary of defense.\"General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!\" Trump tweeted.The two men met for a little over an hour Saturday afternoon in Bedminster, New Jersey. An official familiar with the transition process characterized it to CNN on Saturday as an important meeting. Mattis can be considered a leading candidate for secretary of defense, the source said.The source cautioned it's not a done deal but said Trump has been extremely impressed with Mattis' resume and what he's heard about him from others and at this stage is leaning in that direction.Asked by reporters if he would choose Mattis to lead the Defense Department, Trump said, \"All I can say is he is the real deal. He is the real deal.\"On Monday, Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, threw his support behind Mattis.\"I am pleased that the President-elect found General Jim Mattis as impressive as I have in the many years I have had the privilege of knowing him,\" McCain said in a statement. General Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops ... General Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense, the U.S. military, and our national security. I hope he has an opportunity to serve America again.\"In Mattis, Trump has a candidate who was held in high regard throughout the ranks of the Marine Corps during his 44 years of service. A seasoned combat commander, he led a task force into southern Afghanistan in 2001 and a Marine division at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003. The retired four-star general, who was known as \"Mad Dog,\" was lauded for his leadership of Marines in the 2004 Battle of Falluja in Iraq -- one of the bloodiest of the war.  But he attracted controversy in 2005 when he said \"it's fun to shoot some people\" while addressing service members in San Diego. He also served as a commander of a major NATO strategic command, Allied Command Transformation, in Norfolk, Virginia.White nationalist bloodied in protestMattis, known as a plain-spoken leader well-liked by his Marines, was later promoted to run US Central Command in 2010 -- a post that gave him command responsibility for all US forces in the Middle East. He also was an outspoken critic of the Iran nuclear deal.But should Trump decide to choose Mattis for the Pentagon, his 2013 retirement would create at least one hurdle: A retired officer is required to be out of uniform for at least seven years before taking control of the sprawling Pentagon responsibilities. Mattis would require a waiver from Congress to be eligible for the position -- something that, with Republicans in control on Capitol Hill and the general praise for the general's career, would likely be a formality to obtain.

Michael Flynn as national security adviser, US Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas for CIA chief and Sen.

It is nothing short of the same bullying tactic we rightly have criticized Trump for in the past.

{"_id":"Tsunamis Fast Facts","articleText":" (CNN)Here is some background information about tsunamis.Tsunamis are formed by a displacement of water - a landslide, volcanic eruption, or slippage of the boundary between two of the earth's tectonic plates - slabs of rock 50 to 650 feet (15 to 200 meters) thick that carry the Earth's continents and seas on an underground ocean of much hotter, semi-solid material. Tsunamis can travel up to 600 mph (965 k/ph, 521 knots) at the deepest point of the water, but slow as they near the shore, eventually hitting the shore at 30 to 40 mph (48 to 64 k/ph, 26 to 35 knots). The energy of the wave's speed is transferred to height and sheer force as it nears shore.  Major or Notable Tsunamis:November 1, 1755 - An estimated 60,000 people are killed when an earthquake strikes Lisbon, Portugal, and causes a tsunami.  August 27, 1883 - An estimated 36,000 people are killed when the Krakatau volcano erupts causing a tsunami in the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. June 15, 1896 - An estimated 28,000 people are killed when an 8.5 magnitude earthquake strikes Sanriku, Japan, causing a tsunami. December 28, 1908 - An estimated 70,000 - 100,000 people are killed when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake strikes Messina, Italy, and causes a tsunami in the Straights of Messina.

{"_id":"Turkey withdraws proposed child rape bill following outrage","articleText":" (CNN)Turkey has withdrawn a controversial bill which would have pardoned men convicted of child rape, if they married the victim.The bill, which was proposed by Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), sparked protests across the country and prompted fears from the United Nations about child sex abuse.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim has now sent the bill to a parliamentary subcommittee to be reworked, state-run news agency Anadolu said Tuesday.  The Turkish government said the bill would have applied to at least 3,000 men already in prison, Anadolu added.But the United Nations said in a statement that the bill would \"would create a perception of impunity in favor of perpetrators of such child rights violations. \"In addition, it would increase the risk for further victimization of the child if she marries the perpetrator of the sexual abuse.\"Following fierce criticism from opposition parties and the public, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan advised caution in moving forward with the bill.\"It is obvious that the debate that started during the negotiations of the draft law necessitates reconsideration of the issue, which leads to very different reactions, criticisms and proposals in the public opinion,\" he told Anadolu.The legal age of sexual consent in Turkey is 18, but the practice of child marriage is widespread, according to UNICEF. Tensions with Europe Opposition to the proposed bill comes as the European Parliament meets Tuesday to discuss whether to freeze talks on Turkey joining the European Union, with a final vote due Thursday. The outcome looks grim for Turkey. The attempted coup in July -- and subsequent crackdown led by Erdogan -- has greatly strained Turkey's relations with the EU.\"Turkey has crossed the line of what is acceptable for an EU candidate-country,\" rapporteur for Turkey at the European Parliament, Kati Piri, told CNN in a statement ahead of the debate. \"(This involves) the arrest of 10 Turkish opposition MPs, the jailing of 142 journalists critical to the ruling government and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of citizens without legal proceeding.\"\"We should maintain a dialogue, but under the current situation it is not credible to continue the talks on EU membership.\"Following the failed military coup, Erdogan also told CNN he would approve reinstating the death penalty if lawmakers backed the measure in parliament.If Turkey brought back capital punishment, it wouldn't be joining the European Union anytime soon, according to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.Added to this is increased tensions over the refugee crisis. In August, Turkish officials threatened to stop implementing the deal Turkey signed in March to take back migrants who had crossed into Greece.Turkey's foreign minister explicitly linked the viability of the deal with the EU fulfilling its pledge to grant Turks visa-free travel by October. In response, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel spoke of \"visa blackmail.\"What are Erdogan's priorities? Turkey first began EU accession negotiations in 2005 -- but is it still top of Erdogan's list in 2016? \"Erdogan is far more focused on Turkish domestic issues and securing more power for himself, than he is about EU membership and securing visa-free travel for Turks throughout the EU,\" explained CNN International Correspondent Will Ripley.Added to this, the country has also suffered an increasing number of terror attacks in recent years from ISIS and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), both of which have strongholds in neighboring Syria. On Monday, Erdogan called for an overhaul of the United Nations, saying its Security Council had failed to address the Syria conflict and other global challenges.The Turkish President gave an unabashed speech in Istanbul at the closing of a NATO meeting, where he slammed the Security Council's concentration of power, reiterating that \"the world is bigger than five.\"Thousands of security personnel dismissed For now, Turkey's post-attempted coup crackdown continues. Tuesday, the government dismissed almost 10,000 security personnel -- including some 7,586 police officers -- for alleged connections to outlawed organizations, according to Anadolu. In addition to the security dismissals, 550 non-governmental organizations, 19 private health institutions and nine media organizations have also been shut down, said Anadolu.In the first month following the attempted coup, more than 35,000 people were detained and 17,000 arrested. It is unclear how many have been held in total.CNN's Joel Williams, Will Ripley and Angela Dewan contributed to this report ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/europe/turkey-child-rape-bill/index.html"}
{"_id":"Turkey's Erdogan calls for UN shake-up over Syria war","articleText":" (CNN)Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for an overhaul of the United Nations on Monday, saying its Security Council had failed to address the Syria conflict and other global challenges.Erdogan gave an unabashed speech in Istanbul at the closing of a NATO meeting, where he slammed the Security Council's concentration of power, reiterating that \"the world is bigger than five.\"\"There are so many countries. There are five permanent members of the Security Council and one of those five permanent members can make a decision that binds the rest of the world. That is not fair, that is not just.\" \"There have been numerous positive steps taken, however, the United Nations failed to act effectively facing a number of issues, Syria included,\" Erdogan said. The Security Council, responsible for international peace and security issues, includes five permanent member states -- the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom -- which all hold the power to veto decisions or resolutions.The Council has been widely criticized as ineffective over its inaction on the war, failing to push through decisions on the conflict since it broke out with the Arab Spring in 2011.That's because Russia -- an ally to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government -- has used its veto power five times regarding the conflict, while China vetoed four of the five.It took three years before any decisive international intervention, beginning with US-led airstrikes in 2014.\"To achieve international peace and security, it's going to be very difficult, and perhaps fail if the United Nations is not restructured,\" he said.\"The United Nations was formed at the end of World War II and we cannot continue to manage this world with an organization that old.\"Unity in SyriaErdogan also took the opportunity to call on world powers to stop supporting \"terrorist organizations,\" including the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). The US calls the YPG a \"moderate rebel group\" and has given it military support and arms through the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance fighting ISIS militants.\"Some say ... we do not recognize the YPG as a terrorist organization because they fight against Daesh,\" Erdogan said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. He pointed out that Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, the militant group formerly known as Jabat Al-Nusra, was also fighting ISIS and was internationally considered a terrorist organization.\"They fight against Daesh. Just because a terrorist fights another terrorist, can you call them a good terrorist? At least that's what we are seeing in Syria and Iraq,\" he said. He also called on the world to help implement a no-fly zone in Syria, a policy that US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton suggested during the election campaign. But the idea has been met with little enthusiasm in Washington, where it has been mulled for years. \"But despite saying yes to us, (the no-fly zone) has been left just sitting there without action. And it is my wish from now on, headed by the United States, that these steps now can be taken. And we can strike a blow to terrorist organizations, and the dangers in Turkey can be eliminated,\" he said.Broken promises on refugees Erdogan also used the opportunity to criticize Europe's response to the refugee crisis, complaining that the burden had fallen heavily on Turkey's shoulders and that the Turkish people were not given enough in return. \"As you know, since the beginning of the crisis in Syria, Turkey has taken its place at the frontline. And Turkey has never turned shy from its humanitarian duties. Turkey has opened its doors to over 3 million Syrians, and unfortunately all the promises of support made to Turkey have remained just that -- promises, and only a small fraction of those premises have materialized,\" he said. In March the European Union reached a deal with Ankara, in which Turkey would essentially prevent migrants from leaving its coast for EU states, or would accept migrants sent back from EU countries for registration there. In return, Turkey was to receive significant financial aid and its push to join the union was to be expedited. Erdogan was speaking on the final day of the 62nd annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, where the Syrian conflict and Europe's refugee crisis featured heavily in talks.NATO -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- is a 28-member group that deals with security issues in the Atlantic and couples the United States with its European allies. US President-elect Donald Trump during his election campaign questioned Washington's commitment to NATO, as he expressed interest in bringing the US closer to Russia. Moscow has reiterated it is not a regional security threat and accuses NATO of provoking regional tensions.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/middleeast/turkey-un-erdogan-syria/index.html"}
{"_id":"Turning Points: Together in sickness, married in health","articleText":" (CNN)Leeanne Hester was seeing a patient when she suddenly felt like she was going to pass out and had to excuse herself from the room. The 23-year-old was working a part-time job at a primary care physician's office while close to finishing earning her master's degree in public health at George Washington University in the early summer of 2013. For months, she had dealt with an unbearable level of fatigue that shadowed her every day, until she was exhausted all of time. Then there was a sick feeling in her stomach that wouldn't go away and unexplained weight loss. But this light-headed episode was enough to finally make her see a doctor. Everything had been falling into place. Soon, she would finish school. Her boyfriend, Jimmy Mako, would be joining her in Virginia in the fall. They had met while she was an undergraduate student trainer at Wittenberg University in Ohio and he was on a physical therapy rotation in the athletic department. Now, they were talking more and more about their future together.After a colonoscopy, Hester was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. But what she wouldn't know for several months is that she had been misdiagnosed. Her situation was much more dire. A rare caseBetween the summer and fall of 2013, she followed up with her doctors and learned that her blood counts weren't recovering, which meant the illness wasn't Crohn's. She credits her education, especially in public health, for helping her to advocate for herself.\"I cannot emphasize how important it is to advocate for yourself in our health care system,\" she said. \"I didn't shy away from asking questions and pushing for answers, because I knew something wasn't right with my body. I even had to call and remind one of my specialists that I needed to schedule a followup appointment. Had I waited even a month or two, it may have been too late.\"Following her instincts, Hester scheduled a bone marrow biopsy for early December. After so many specialists, she didn't expect it to reveal anything. But on December 3, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer, and told to start chemotherapy immediately. The cancer can kill within four to six weeks without treatment, Hester said. \"It was extremely overwhelming and shocking to be told that I had cancer,\" Hester said. \"It was the last thing I expected. But I knew all along that something was going on. You know your body.\"Three days later, Hester was admitted to the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in her hometown of Columbus. For a week straight, she received a constant drip of chemotherapy. She was hospitalized for treatment for a month, and she would go back in the following months for two more rounds. Meanwhile, after finishing his physical therapy contract in the Washington, D.C., area, Mako packed up her things and moved to Columbus to be closer to her. He never missed a day visiting her in the hospital. \"You know a man really loves you when he shaves your head for you when your hair is falling out, and he still tells you you're beautiful, kisses you and holds your hands through it all,\" Hester said. At the James, Hester was finally able to receive some answers about her misdiagnosis. \"Her case was unusual but not challenging,\" said Dr. Rebecca Klisovic, her lead doctor at the James. \"She faced a few months of confusion because she was a little bit anemic when she was diagnosed with Crohn's. But when her anemia got worse, then we looked closer at that.\"Acute myeloid leukemia is an uncommon cancer, especially for people Hester's age, with three to five cases per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe per year, Klisovic said. But Hester's case was even more rare: She had two mutations associated with her leukemia. One was low-risk, but the other, FLT3, was high-risk. One-third of acute myeloid leukemia patients have this mutation, which increases the chances of a relapse.Klisovic recommended that Hester be placed on the waiting list for a bone marrow transplant. Given the fact that she was young and healthy outside of having the cancer, she would be able to handle the rigors of the procedure. Without a transplant, Hester might have lived for five more years at best. But because a bone marrow transplant is essentially like transplanting an immune system, it would help stave off a relapse.Family members are ideal bone marrow donors, but Hester's younger sister, Lindsay, wasn't a match. In March 2014, her doctors narrowed the list to four candidates through the National Marrow Donor Program. Three responded, and one, a 22-year-old man in Israel named Evgeny Galinsky, was a perfect match. In May, Hester received the transplant, which is comparable to a blood transfusion. She was placed in isolation because the pre-transplant process had involved essentially killing off the T cells of her own immune system so her body would accept the new marrow. When he came to visit, Mako had to wear a mask. She struggled with graft versus host disease, in which the new immune system attacks organs. Not unlike an allergic reaction, she had skin and joint issues in response. Hester also suffered from gastrointestinal infections, some of the worst Klisovic had seen. But she was able to overcome it all. Her doctors will continue to keep an eye on her, as the risk of a relapse is greatest in the first two years after treatment, but they don't anticipate any further problems.In December 2014, Mako took her on a long weekend trip to Chicago. That Sunday, they went out for a nice dinner before taking an evening walk past the sculpture known as the \"Bean\" and on to a fountain. There, he bent down on one knee and proposed. \"The emotional and physical rigors of cancer definitely made us a lot closer and strengthened our bond,\" Hester said. \"It forced us, as it would most people, to really address those tough issues in life at a young age; it made us more vulnerable and honest with each other. It took away all the frills of love and made us really look at our commitment to one another and especially, in my opinion, his commitment to me. It truly revealed the depth of our love for each other. I think we've got that whole 'in sickness and in health' thing down.\"A 'life-saving donation'Per the rules of the transplant center, Hester had to wait a year before learning the identity of her donor. She wrote him a letter and sent it to his address in Israel. It turned out that he was part of a helicopter squadron with the Israel Defense Forces. When Israeli soldiers are enlisted, they can provide a cheek swab to become part of the bone marrow registry partnership through the transplant center Ezer Mizion.\"I thanked him for his life-saving donation, which gave me a chance to experience all life's events, including marriage to Jimmy and the privilege of growing old,\" Hester said.Two months later, she received an email from Galinsky. He was happy to learn that she was recovering and that she had even reached out. Before her letter, he had no way of knowing whom his donation had helped, but he said he believed that all lives were worth saving.They exchanged more correspondence, and she began to develop a portrait of Galinsky: a humble and kind young man who used emojis when he was joking and liked to ride motorcycles with his friends. They talked about their hobbies and shared stories and photos of their families. In April, Galinsky came to the wedding, a small ceremony in a historical church in Ohio. Hester said it was surreal to meet him in person, after only ever exchanging emails, but she wouldn't have had it any other way. \"We were both very grateful to have Evgeny be a part of our wedding celebration, which probably wouldn't have been possible without his donation,\" Hester said. \"Having him there really felt like it gave a wholeness to the day, because the wedding not only marked a new chapter for me and Jimmy as being husband and wife, but also that we could move forward with me being healthy and hope for the future.\"She is continuing to do well more than a year after the transplant and returned to work six months ago. Now, the happy couple is enjoying married life, and Hester (now Mako) hopes she can use her experience to help others. \"Cancer is really ugly and hard,\" she said, \"but the love and resilience that people show through the suffering is really beautiful.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/health/turning-points-bone-marrow-donation-wedding/index.html"}

{"_id":"U.S. envoy to U.N. blames and shames Syria, Russia over Aleppo","articleText":" (CNN)U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power upbraided Syria's Bashar al-Assad regime and Russia for its military actions across Syria and particularly in the war-torn and devastated city of Aleppo, and she publicly named and shamed Syrian commanders for their involvement in deadly assaults and running prisons where torture has been reported..Power made reference to the recent days of bombings on eastern Aleppo and surrounding countryside, which have left more than 300 people dead, the most intense bombing since the conflict started in 2011. The devastated city is divided between government-controlled areas in the west and rebel positions in the east.\"Think of what you were doing Saturday,\" she said at a U.N. Security Council briefing on Monday about the humanitarian situation in Syria. \"Imagine being subjected to 180 airstrikes while you were doing it. Horrifying video from eastern Aleppo affirms a shocking inhuman barrage on civilian neighborhoods.\"The Syrian regime resumed heavy bombardment over eastern Aleppo on Tuesday after a three-week lull, killing at least 289 people by Saturday, according to the Syrian Civil Defense Force, also called the White Helmets.  Among the latest reported violence: a suspected chemical attack that killed four children and their parents. On Monday, Aleppo withstood another day of all-out war as bombardments in eastern Aleppo left at least 27 people dead and 120 injured on Monday, the White Helmets said.Power noted that the United States strongly condemned shelling by opposition forces, which has caused more than 60 casualties since November 1. But she focused her ire on the Assad regime and Russia for their \"starve, get bombed, or surrender\" strategy in eastern Aleppo.\"But, I ask, will Russia condemn even a single airstrike by the Assad regime here in this chamber today -- or any day? Choose any of the hospitals that the Assad regime has destroyed, or any of the schools. Will Russia ever condemn its ally Bashar Al-Assad here at the Council for a single one of these attacks? We have been attending sessions like this one for more than five years. But, despite all of the carnage inflicted by their regime partners, they have uttered not one critical word. Not even one skeptical word,\" she said.The assault on Aleppo, she said, was \"not an isolated case. It is part of a country-wide strategy. Across Syria, Russia and the Assad regime are waging a campaign that includes sieges, the blocking of humanitarian aid, the indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas, and the use of barrel bombs.\"Other representatives at the meeting slammed the Assad regime and Russia for its actions in Aleppo. Both entities pushed back. Russian envoy Vladimir K. Safronkov, said the \"country had been assisting United Nations humanitarian aid and other assistance in Syria, as well as facilitating political efforts.\" The Syrian representative, Bashar Ja'afari, said it \"allowed civilians in eastern Aleppo to flee and had opened corridors for them to do so.\"  \"The terrorists, however, had retained civilians to use as human shields,\" Ja'afari said.According to a transcript of her remarks, the U.S. ambassador named Syrian commanders involved in deadly assaults on \"cities, residential areas and civilian infrastructure: Major General Adib Salameh, Brigadier General Adnan Aboud Hilweh, Major General Jawdat Salbi Mawas, Colonel Suhail Hassan, Major General Tahir Hamid Khalil.\"She added, \"The United States will not let those who have commanded units involved in these actions hide anonymously behind the façade of the Assad regime.\"She also named commanders who work at detention facilities where torture has been reported: Major General Jamil Hassan, Brigadier General Abdul Salam Fajr Mahmoud, Brigadier General Ibrahim Ma'la, Colonel Qusai Mihoub, Brigadier General Salah Hamad, Brigadier General Sha'afiq Masa, Major General Rafiq Shihadeh, Hafiz Makhlouf.\"The United States will not forget the cases of the many Syrians who have suffered so much at the hands of individuals like these, and we will continue fighting to hold them accountable for their hateful crimes,\" she said.She called for an end to the \"merciless attacks\" from Russia and Assad's regime.\"Now, I know right now, today, with wind at their backs, these individuals feel impunity. So, though, did Slobodan Milosevic, Charles Taylor, and countless war criminals before them,\" she said, citing the former leaders of Serbia and Liberia. \"Today's atrocities are well-documented, and the civilized world's memories are long.\"","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/middleeast/syria-aleppo-violence/index.html"}

{"_id":"UK soccer child sex abuse hotline gets 50 calls in first hours","articleText":"London (CNN)A hotline set up for people who were sexually abused while playing soccer in Britain as children has received more than 50 calls in its first few hours, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children says.The service was launched Thursday morning, with the support of England's Football Association (FA), after former English footballers Andy Woodward, Steve Walters and Paul Stewart spoke to British media about being sexually abused as children. Another player, David White, has also come forward. Chief executive of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) Peter Wanless said: \"There must be no hiding place for sexual abuse in our national game and there may be many others who suffered through such horrors as young players but have never come forward.\"Coach jailed for abuseFormer Sheffield United player Woodward was the first to tell his story publicly, explaining how he was abused by coach Barry Bennell while playing for Crewe Alexandra football club, in northern England in the 1980s and 1990s.Bennell was jailed in 1998 for nine years after admitting to sexually abusing children, including Woodward. Former England and Manchester City star White and ex-Manchester United player Walters have also revealed they were among Bennell's victims, though it is unclear whether Bennell was convicted of abusing them. Stewart, who played for Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, said another coach had repeatedly sexually assaulted him and threatened to kill his family if he spoke out.Woodward's and Walters' Twitter accounts have been flooded with support in recent days. \"This momentum WILL save people,\" Woodward wrote. Walters said he was \"totally taken back\" by the support he had received since opening up about the abuse he suffered. 'Safe haven' neededIn a statement appealing for others affected by child abuse in the sport to come forward, the NSPCC said boys were less likely to speak up about sexual abuse. \"Football locker rooms and clubs are traditionally very masculine and male environments. This means it can be difficult for players to talk about issues such as sexuality or abuse. \"But it's crucial they speak out. Along with the FA, we're urging players and others involved in football, from those just starting out to Premier League, to [use] our helpline,\" the charity said.Detective Inspector Sarah Hall of Cheshire Police's public protection unit told the Press Association Wednesday that \"we have now been made aware of a number of people who have come forward wishing to speak to the police\" with similar claims. She said no arrests had been made so far.Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said it was a \"timely warning for everybody in football about our duty of care to these youngsters\" and that he wanted the union to be a \"safe haven,\" the Press Association reported.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/europe/uk-football-child-sex-abuse/index.html"}
{"_id":"UK teenager wins battle to have body cryogenically frozen ","articleText":"London (CNN)A British teenager who died of cancer has been cryogenically frozen in the United States after winning a court case before her death.  The girl -- who can't be identified and is referred to only as \"JS\" -- suffered from a rare form of cancer and expressed a hope to be brought back to life and cured in the future.She died on October 17 but details of the case at London's High Court were not allowed to be made public until now.   In his judgment, obtained by CNN, Mr. Justice Peter Jackson said the girl had expressed her desire to be cryogenically frozen.She wrote: \"I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done. I'm only 14 years old and I don't want to die, but I know I am going to. I think being cryo-preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up, even in hundreds of years' time. I don't want to be buried underground. \"I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. I want to have this chance. This is my wish.\"According to the judgment, the girl's parents are divorced and their relationship is \"very bad.\" Her mother was supportive of her wish, but her father -- who had not seen his daughter face-to-face since 2008 -- initially was not.READ MORE: What is cryopreservation?'Bright, intelligent' girlAt the start of proceedings, the teenager's father, who also has cancer, wrote: \"Even if the treatment is successful and [JS] is brought back to life in let's say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America.\"However, he subsequently changed his position, saying he \"respected the decisions\" his daughter was making.The judge said this fluctuation in his views was understandable, adding, \"No other parent has ever been put in his position.\"But he emphasized he was not ruling on the science of cryonics, but rather on the dispute between her parents over who was responsible for the arrangements after her death.The judge also said there was no doubt the girl -- described as \"a bright, intelligent young person who is able to articulate strongly held views on her current situation\" -- had the capacity to start legal action.\"Over recent months, JS has used the internet to investigate cryonics: the freezing of a dead body in the hope that resuscitation and a cure may be possible in the distant future,\" he said.  \"The scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications. \"On the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a well-known process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment.  \"Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme.\"The judge ruled in favor of her mother and said the girl had died peacefully, knowing her wishes had been met. But he cautioned that hospital officials had had \"real misgivings\" about the way the process was handled on the day she died.The girl's mother was said to have been preoccupied with the arrangements after her death, rather than being fully available to her child, he said, and the voluntary organization which helped get her body ready for preservation was disorganized.Body packed in dry iceThe case was said by the judge to be the only one of its kind to have come before the courts in England and Wales, and probably anywhere else. \"It is an example of the new questions that science poses to the law, perhaps most of all to family law,\" he added.The cost of the procedure in the United States -- which the judge said was about £37,000 ($46,000) -- is being met by her maternal grandparents, he said, although the family is not well off. They chose the most basic arrangement, he said, which \"simply involves the freezing of the body in perpetuity.\"The Cryonics Institute, which is based in Michigan, said the body of a 14-year-old girl from London arrived at its facility, packed in dry ice, on October 25, about eight days after her death. \"The patient was then placed in the computer controlled cooling chamber to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature,\" a statement posted on its website said.\"The human cooling program from dry ice was selected and the time needed to cool the patient to liquid nitrogen temperature was 24 hours. The patient was then placed in a cryostat for longterm cryonic storage.\"The Cryonics Institute said the girl was its 143rd patient.Its website explains the process as \"a technique intended to hopefully save lives and greatly extend lifespan. It involves cooling legally-dead people to liquid nitrogen temperature where physical decay essentially stops, in the hope that future scientific procedures will someday revive them and restore them to youth and good health. \"A person held in such a state is said to be a 'cryopreserved patient', because we do not regard the cryopreserved person as being inevitably 'dead'.\"Can a whole body survive freezing process?However, some skepticism remains about the science of cryogenics.Barry Fuller, professor in Surgical Science and Low Temperature Medicine at University College London, said that cryopreservation \"has many useful applications in day to day medicine, such as cryopreserving blood cells, sperm and embryos.\"But, he said, \"cryopreservation has not yet been successfully applied to large structures, such as human kidneys for transplantation, because we have not yet adequately been able to produce suitable equipment to optimize all the steps.\"This is why we have to say that at the moment we have no objective evidence that a whole human body can survive cryopreservation with cells which will function after rearming.\"CNN's Simon Cullen and Meera Senthilingam contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/uk-teenager-cryonics-body-preservation/index.html"}

The nuclear power reactor units provide the United States with about 20% of its electricity. Other Facts:The Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC maintains a threat assessment branch, which assesses security threats to nuclear facilities throughout the country. Reactors are massive structures, typically constructed with two to five feet of steel-reinforced concrete. The containments have an interior steel lining, and redundant safety equipment to add further protection.Sixty-six reactor units are \"pressurized water reactors\" and 34 are \"boiling water reactors.\" These two types of reactors the only reactors that are in commercial operation in the United States.There are 31 licensed and operating research reactors in the United States. The majority are located at universities. Since September 11, additional security measures have been put in place at nuclear facilities that includes increased patrols, augmented security forces and weapons, additional security posts, heightened coordination with law enforcement and military authorities and additional limitations on access to the site of personnel in vehicles.Timeline:May 26, 1958 - As a part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace\" program, the first commercial nuclear power plant opens as the Shippingport Atomic Power Station.March 28, 1979 - The Three Mile Island nuclear plant built near Middleton, Pennsylvania goes into meltdown due to a faulty pressure valve in the Unit 2 reactor, design-related problems, and human error.

{"_id":"US and China conduct rare military drill ","articleText":"Kunming, China (CNN)If natural disasters often prompt countries to put their differences aside and work together, so does training for them.That kind of cooperation was on display during a joint disaster relief exercise held by the United States and China in the southwest Chinese city of Kunming last week. Around 200 soldiers trained for several days on a variety of scenarios, a rare instance of cooperation that stands in stark contrast to the otherwise often contentious relationship between the world's two largest militaries.\"It's an opportunity for young soldiers from the US Army and young soldiers from the People's Liberation Army to kind of come together and understand each other and create bonds,\" US Army Lt. Col. David Downing told CNN. Uneasy ties Since 2012, China has seized territory and militarized artificial islands in the South China Sea, a strategy the US has opposed. In response, the US has sailed warships through the disputed waters and flown planes nearby. Both sides have also accused the other of conducting cyber attacks, and China has been angered by US plans to install a missile defense system in South Korea by the end of this year. It's all part of a complicated relationship that the new US commander in chief will have to manage. But what will President-elect Donald Trump's China policy look like? While Trump was keen to drive home an anti-China economic message on the campaign trail, he largely avoided military issues. Some analysts have speculated that Trump will give China more of a free pass in the South China Sea, choosing to focus on issues such as trade. But others point to potential Trump Cabinet appointees as signs that a tough-on-China policy could be in the works. Anti-China team?Trump's China team \"will be very conservative people who really embrace a very anti-China rhetoric,\" said Tong Zhao, an associate researcher at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. \"They see China as the primary American strategic rival in the future.\" Trump's pick for national security adviser, retired general Mike Flynn, has said China should \"certainly\" be viewed as an enemy of the US. James Mattis, a former general and top contender for defense secretary, last year called for a \"policy to build the counterbalance if China continues to expand its bullying role in the South China Sea.\" Building trustIn Kunming, as his troops took part in the disaster relief exercise, CNN asked another expert, Gen. Robert Brown, commander of US Army Pacific, what advice he'd give the Trump administration on China. \"The more you can build relationships, it then leads to trust,\" Brown said. \"So you can have differences, but you can discuss and talk about those differences.\"Those differences were put aside during the joint training, but it will be up to Trump and his administration to shape the relationship in years to come.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/asia/china-us-military-drill/index.html"}
{"_id":"US dementia rates drop 24%","articleText":"A new study finds that the prevalence of dementia has fallen sharply in recent years, most likely as a result of Americans' rising educational levels and better heart health, which are both closely related to brain health.Dementia rates in people over age 65 fell from 11.6 percent in 2000 to 8.8 percent in 2012, a decline of 24 percent, according to a study of more than 21,000 people across the country published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.\"It's definitely good news,\" said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan and a coauthor of the new study. \"Even without a cure for Alzheimer's disease or a new medication, there are things that we can do socially and medically and behaviorally that can significantly reduce the risk.\"The decline in dementia rates translates to about one million fewer Americans suffering from the condition, said John Haaga, director of behavioral and social research at the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the new study.Dementia is a general term for a loss of memory or other mental abilities that's severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease, which is believed to be caused by a buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain, is the most common type of dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia and occurs after a stroke.The new research confirms the results of several other studies that also have found steady declines in dementia rates in the United States and Europe. The new research provides some of the strongest evidence yet for a decline in dementia rates because of its broad scope and diverse ranges of incomes and ethnic groups, Haaga said. The average age of participants in the study, called the Health and Retirement Study, was 75.The study, which began in 1992, focuses on people over age 50, collecting data every two years. Researchers conduct detailed interviews with participants about their health, income, cognitive ability and life circumstances. The interviews also include physical tests, body measurements and blood and saliva samples.While advocates for people with dementia welcomed the news, they noted that Alzheimer's disease and other forms of memory loss remain a serious burden for the nation and the world.  Up to five million Americans today suffer from dementia, a number that is expected to triple by 2050, as people live longer and the elderly population increases.The number of Americans over age 65 is expected to nearly double by 2050, reaching 84 million, according to the U.S. Census. So even if the percentage of elderly people who develop dementia is smaller than previously estimated, the total number of Americans suffering from the condition will continue to increase, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach, medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association.\"Alzheimer's is going to remain the public health crisis of our time, even with modestly reduced rates,\" Fargo said.Although researchers can't definitively explain why dementia rates are decreasing, Langa said doctors may be doing a better job controlling high blood pressure and diabetes, which can both boost the risk of age-related memory problems. High blood pressure and diabetes both increase the risk of strokes, which kill brain cells, increasing the risk of vascular dementia.\"We've been saying now for several years that what's good for your heart is good for your head,\" Fargo said. \"There are several things you can do to reduce your risk for dementia.\"Authors of the study found that senior citizens today are better educated than even half a generation ago. The population studied in 2012 stayed in school 13 years, while the seniors studied in 2000 had about 12 years of education, according to the study.That's significant, because many studies have found a strong link between higher educational levels and lower risk of disease, including dementia, Lang said. The reasons are likely to be complex. People with more education tend to earn more money and have better access to health care. They're less likely to smoke, more likely to exercise and less likely to be overweight. People with more education also may live in safer neighborhoods and have less stress.People who are better educated may have more intellectually stimulating jobs and hobbies that help exercise their brains, Lang said.It's also possible that people with more education can better compensate for memory problems as they age, finding ways to work around their impairments, according to an accompanying editorial by Ozioma Okonkwo and Dr. Sanjay Asthana of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.Yet Americans shouldn't expect dementia rates to continue falling indefinitely, Haaga said.Although educational levels increased sharply after the World War II, those gains have leveled off, Haaga said. People in their 20s today are no more likely to have graduated from college compared to people in their 60s.\"We have widening inequality in health outcomes in the U.S.,\" Haaga said. \"For people without much education, we've had very little improvement in health. The benefits really have gone to those with better educations.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/health/dementia-rates-decline/index.html"}
{"_id":"US identifies ISIS suspect in Paris, Brussels attacks","articleText":" (CNN)The US government has identified a suspect believed to have been involved in the planning of ISIS attacks that rocked the French capital a year ago and Brussels, Belgium, in March.Abdelilah Himich, also known as Abu Sulayman al-Faransi, was named in a US State Department statement Tuesday announcing the designation of three men as terrorists.Himich is a \"senior foreign terrorist fighter and external operations figure\" for ISIS, according to the statement.He is accused of creating a \"European foreign terrorist fighter cell\" in 2015 called the Tariq Ibn Ziyad Battalion that at one time numbered as many as 300 people and has provided operatives for ISIS attacks in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.\"Himich was also reportedly involved in the planning of ISIL's November 2015 Paris attacks and March 2016 Brussels attacks,\" the statement said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.The series of coordinated gun and bomb attacks in Paris last year killed 130 people, 90 of them at a concert at the Bataclan venue and the others at a restaurant, two cafes and a sports stadium.Inside the Bataclan: Night of terror, tale of loveEvents were held this month to commemorate the victims, including a performance by musician Sting to reopen the Bataclan.A source close to the investigation into the Paris attacks told CNN last year that a surviving concertgoer from the Bataclan told investigators that a gunman asked another of the attackers whether he was going to call an individual called \"Souleymane\" as the attack was ongoing. But it's not known whether this could have been a reference to the alias used by Himrich, or to another ISIS member.Artist turns Paris attacks ordeal into graphic novelBrussels bombersThirty-two people were killed and more than 300 were injured March 22 when three suicide bombers blew themselves up at the Brussels airport and on the city's metro.Investigators have long said the Paris and Brussels attacks were planned and carried out by the same ISIS network. Two suspects in the attacks are in French custody. A French intelligence source told CNN earlier this month that investigators had identified the suspected coordinator of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks as a man named Oussama Atar, who remains at large.The other two men designated in the State Department release were Abdullah Ahmed al-Meshedani and Basil Hassan.The former is described as an ISIS leader \"who manages arriving foreign terrorist fighters, handles guesthouses for them, and transports suicide bombers\" on behalf of ISIS. He's also reportedly an adviser to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Hassan is said to be an \"external operations plotter\" who in 2013 was accused of shooting Danish author and journalist Lars Hedegaard. After his arrest in Turkey in 2014, Hassan was released as part of an alleged exchange for 49 hostages held by ISIS, the State Department said, and is believed to have traveled to Syria to join the terror group.CNN's Laura Koran contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/europe/us-isis-paris-brussels-suspect-identified/index.html"}
{"_id":"US issues Europe travel alert after France foils ISIS-linked plot ","articleText":" (CNN)The US State Department issued a travel alert Monday urging US nationals to exercise caution at holiday festivals, events and outdoor markets in Europe in the coming weeks, just a day after French security services thwarted an ISIS-linked plot. French authorities arrested seven people after anti-terror raids in Strasbourg and Marseilles on Sunday, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Monday.  The over eight-month investigation foiled a \"new terrorist attack that had been planned for a long time on our soil,\" Cazeneuve said during a news conference in Paris.Strasbourg is home to one of the most famous Christmas markets in Europe, with 2 million people expected to visit after it opens Friday. French media reported the market was a potential target of the cell.  In 2000, the Strasbourg Christmas market was the target of a thwarted plot by al Qaeda-linked terrorists.  US State Department officials told CNN the new alert was not triggered by any one specific threat, but the timing may not be a coincidence. \"Credible information indicates the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Da'esh), al Qaeda, and their affiliates continue to plan terrorist attacks in Europe, with a focus on the upcoming holiday season and associated events. US citizens should also be alert to the possibility that extremist sympathizers or self-radicalized extremists may conduct attacks during this period with little or no warning. Terrorists may employ a wide variety of tactics, using both conventional and nonconventional weapons and targeting both official and private interests,\" stated the alert, which expires on February 20, 2017.  Investigators said they believe the people behind the plot thwarted over the weekend in France were being directed by a terrorist operative inside Syria linked to ISIS, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The source told CNN authorities are investigating whether any of the individuals arrested over the weekend in Marseilles and Strasbourg traveled to Syria. They suspect some of those under arrest traveled to Syria via Cyprus, but have not yet definitively established this. A second source, a senior French counterterrorism official, told CNN that in the past few days a threat by individuals suspected of links to ISIS in Syria had been thwarted.  The suspects arrested in Marseilles and Strasbourg are between 29 and 37 years old and are of French, Moroccan and Afghan nationality. Only the Moroccan suspect was known to investigators, after they received intelligence from a \"neighboring country.\"  In June, two people linked to this case were arrested as part of the operation.  \"Never has the terrorist threat been so high in our country. The anti-terrorist services are completely mobilized,\" French Interior Minister Cazeneuve said.  The case has been handed over to the Public Prosecutor of Paris.  The arrests come at a time of continued heightened concern over the terrorist threat to France. In September, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the threat was at its maximum level and security services were foiling attacks \"every single day.\"The senior French counterterrorism official told CNN that while intensified counterterrorism operations had disrupted the plotting activity of terror networks since the Brussels attacks in March, there was still an acute danger of attacks by radicals on French soil directed, instigated, or inspired to attack, by ISIS. The official said French security services were being surprised time and again by new cases of travel to Syria.  The official said the number of Islamist extremists on the radar screen of French security services had grown to more than 15,000 and one growing concern was how quickly radicalization was taking place, with investigations establishing that Nice truck attacker Mohamed Bouhlel, who killed 84 on July 14, was radicalized in just two months. Attacks instigated by ISIS over the Internet have also become a growing concern. Rachid Kassim, a 29-year-old French ISIS recruit in Syria, is suspected of stage-managing plots by radicals who have remained in France by communicating with them through the encrypted Telegram messaging app. He was linked to a string of plots this summer, including the killing of a police couple, the killing of a priest and an attempted attack on Notre Dame cathedral, but appears to have gone offline in recent weeks, French security sources told CNN.CNN's Michael Callahan, Laura Koran and Camille Verdier contributed to this report.

{"_id":"US military prepares for the next frontier: Space war","articleText":"Watch the CNN special report \"War in Space: The Next Battlefield\" Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. Washington (CNN)Since man first explored space, it has been a largely peaceful environment. But now US adversaries are deploying weapons beyond Earth's atmosphere, leading the US military to prepare for the frightening prospect of war in space.  \"As humans go out there, there has always been conflict. Conflict in the Wild West as we move in the West ... conflict twice in Europe for its horrible world wars,\" Gen. John Hyten, head of US Strategic Command, told CNN. \"So, every time humans actually physically move into that, there's conflict, and in that case, we'll have to be prepared for that.\"Today, the US depends on space more than any other nation. Without satellites, televisions would go blank, mobile networks silent, and the Internet would slow and then stop.Dependent on time stamps from GPS satellites, everything from stock markets to bank transactions to traffic lights and railroad switches would freeze. Airline pilots would lose contact with the ground, unsure of their position and without weather data to steer around storms.World leaders couldn't communicate across continents. In the US military, pilots would lose contact with armed drones over the Middle East. Smart bombs would become dumb. Missiles would sit immobile in their silos. The US could lose early warning of nuclear attacks for parts of the Earth.\"There's incentive to take that away from us,\" said Peter Singer, who advises the Defense Department on space threats and authored \"Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,\" which runs through a scenario of space war. \"And that means if there was conflict on Planet Earth, it would almost inherently start with some kind of conflict in space.\"America's chief adversaries in space are familiar ones: Russia and China are extending above the atmosphere the competition and conflict already boiling down here on Earth -- from Syria to Ukraine to the South China Sea to cyberspace.China and Russia are taking aim at America in space with a dizzying array of weapons seemingly borrowed from science fiction. Russia has deployed what could be multiple kamikaze satellites such as \"Kosmos 2499\" -- designed to sidle up to American satellites and then, if ordered, disable or destroy them. China has launched the \"Shiyan\" -- equipped with a grappling arm that could snatch US satellites right out of orbit.\"We would absolutely be shocked if the US military were not on a war footing now based on what we see,\" said Paul Graziani, CEO of the civilian satellite tracker AGI. These are not experimental weapons of the future, but weapons of today, already operating from Near Earth Orbit, just 100 miles up and home of the International Space Station, to Medium Earth Orbit at 12,500 miles, where the GPS satellites fly, all the way up to 22,000 miles in Geostationary Orbit, home of the nation's most sensitive military communications and nuclear early-warning satellites.Hyten warned that adversaries will soon be able to threaten US satellites in every orbital regime. \"We have very good surveillance and intelligence capabilities, so we can see the threats that are being built,\" said Hyten. \"So we're developing capabilities to defend ourselves. It's really that simple.\"To respond, the US has created a massive new Space Command, with some 38,000 employees, a $25 billion annual budget, and 134 locations around the globe. Among them are units such as the 50th Space Wing, a 352-member team charged with monitoring US and foreign military satellites. For now, these space warriors are little more than spectators, watching and observing this new space battlefield with no ability to fire back.In 2015, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work expressed his grave concern that the military was not \"ready to do space operations in a conflict that extends into space.\"He was proven right when, months later, US space forces were overwhelmed in a mock attack on US military satellites.So many took notice when, in April this year, Work vowed that the US would \"strike back\" if attacked in space -- strike back, he added, and \"knock them out.\"\"From the very beginning, if someone starts going after our space constellation, we're going to go after the capabilities that would prevent them from doing that,\" Work told CNN. \"Let me just say that -- having the capability to shoot the torpedo would be a good thing to have in our quiver.\"Work suggested a space equivalent of the depth charges US Navy warships dropped into the sea during World War II, setting off enormous explosions to fight off attack submarines. \"These satellites were built 15 years ago and launched during an era when space was a benign environment. There was no threat,\" said Lt. Gen. David Buck, Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space. \"Can you imagine building a refueler aircraft, or a jet for that matter, with no inherent defensive capabilities? So our satellites are at risk, and our ground infrastructure is at risk. And we're working hard to make sure that we can protect and defend them.\"So far, such weapons remain in the conceptual category. But the US is quietly developing advanced capabilities that could, some day, have defensive or offensive missions in space.These new weapons include the US Navy's Laser Weapons System, or LAWs, the US military's first operational laser weapon now deployed in the Persian Gulf on board the USS Ponce. The X-37b, a pilotless space drone resembling the space shuttle without windows or a cockpit, has already flown multiple missions to space.Still, as Russia and China make rapid advances, some of the most senior military commanders are sounding the alarm that this is a war -- the next world war and the first to extend beyond the confines of Earth -- that America could lose.\"We'd be silly to say it's not a possibility,\" said Singer. \"What any defense (planner) will tell you is, don't look for the ideal outcome, plan for the worst day so that you can survive.\"Winning a space war means rethinking how the US wages war, and that rethinking is one our current military leaders and politicians are only just beginning to undertake.So is the US moving quickly enough to respond to the new threats in space?\"I would say the answer was no,\" said Gen. William Shelton, former head of Space Command. \"Could we provide active defense of our own satellites? The answer's no.\" The stakes couldn't be higher. How the US responds to this new threat could determine who wins the defining conflict of the 21st century.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/space-war-us-military-preparations/index.html"}
{"_id":"US military: Fatal phone tag with Russians contributed to Syrian deaths","articleText":"Washington (CNN)A US military investigation revealed Tuesday that Russian and coalition officers engaged in a 27-minute game of phone tag while American and coalition warplanes were mistakenly bombing and killing fighters allied with the Syrian regime in September.\"In this instance, we did not rise to the high standard we hold ourselves to, and we must do better than this each and every time,\" Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of US Air Forces in the Middle East, said in a statement accompanying the completion of the classified investigation into the deadly September 17 strike. A redacted executive summary of the report was released Tuesday. \"The decision to strike these targets was made in accordance with the law of armed conflict and the applicable rules of engagement,\" US Brig. Gen. Richard Coe, the officer charged with investigating the airstrike, said in a statement. \"But we concluded based upon post-strike analysis that a number of 'human factors' resulted in incorrect identification of forces on the ground.\" Military officials said the US took the unprecedented step of informing the Russian military in advance of its intent to strike the targets -- which the Americans believed were ISIS -- via a hotline that had been established to ensure mistakes were not made in the airspace used by Russian and US warplanes. Coe acknowledged that the information provided to the Russians was \"off by several kilometers.\" 'Human error'The investigation found that once the strikes began, Russian officials called the hotline and waited to speak to the designated point of contact but were told that the person was unavailable. Coe said the other officer in the operations center offered the chance to pass a message along, but the Russians \"hung up on that phone call to call back later.\" When the Russians rang up a second time and the point of contact was still not available, Coe said, \"They elected not to leave a message and went on hold\" pending the arrival of the officer in question.Coe said 27 minutes elapsed between the first Russian call and the cessation of airstrikes. \"In that 27 minutes, 15 of the 32 strikes happened,\" he said, noting that once the Russian information was received and understood, the coalition \"immediately halted strikes.\"Col. John Thomas, a spokesman for Central Command, told reporters that the coalition had asked the Russians to immediately convey critical information in the future.The US and its coalition allies had previously said they believed their warplanes were targeting ISIS fighters. Russia said at the time the strikes jeopardized a cessation of hostilities that Washington and Moscow had negotiated and that the Syrian regime resumed striking rebel areas soon after, with the accord eventually collapsing.The hotline difficulties were one of several errors highlighted by the investigation, which said \"human error\" in the targeting process was largely to blame for the deadly mistake.Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Coe said there was \"no intent to target Syrian forces\" and added that the units struck on September 17 near Deir Ezzor \"looked and acted like the forces the coalition has been targeting,\" referring to ISIS fighters.\"They were not wearing uniforms, they had no flags or insignia,\" Coe said, adding that the coalition now believes \"those forces were aligned with the Syrian regime more likely than not.\"Review of targeting proceduresOne critical error involved the incorrect identification of a vehicle that targeting analysts believed belonged to ISIS. That vehicle met up with the larger force that was eventually struck, with analysts believing those fighters were also associated with ISIS due to the vehicle's presence there.Coe said Harrigian had ordered a review of targeting procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening. The attack involved 32 strikes carried out by F-16s, A-10s, F/A-18s jets and remotely piloted aircraft. The coalition said 34 precision-category weapons were dropped and 380 30mm rounds were fired on the targets.Representatives from Australia, Denmark and the UK took part in the investigation as they had also been involved in the strikes, along with the US.The coalition said it could only substantiate 15 deaths as a result of the errant attack, but Coe said \"we certainly believe more than 15 individuals were killed,\" although the US was not able to determine the precise number of fatalities. RELATED: Beginning of the end for the Syrian uprising In the days following the attack, the Russian military put the number at 62 Syrian fighters killed.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/us-airstrikes-syria-investigation/index.html"}

Gen. Jerry Martinez.\"We share your objective of completing the transfer by December 22,\" Carter told Abe.Carter arrived in Japan on Monday on a trip to shore up US-Japan military relations amid fears that President-elect Donald Trump might pivot away from the decades-long security alliance.More than 52,000 US troops are in Japan, according to US Forces Japan. Add civilian personnel, contractors and dependents and the US presence there tops 100,000.That presence has been most contentious on Okinawa, where about half of those US troops are based and where relations between US military personnel and residents deteriorated this year following several violent incidents related to American bases on the island.At a June protest attended by more than 60,000 people in the Okinawan capital of Naha, the island's governor, Takeshi Onaga, said he would strongly ask the Japanese government to move all US military bases outside of Okinawa.\"The government should know that the anger of the people in Okinawa is almost reaching a limit and it is not [right] to sacrifice Okinawa people for military bases anymore,\" he said.CNN's Ben Westcott and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/politics/us-japan-okinawa-land-return/index.html"}

Do you think we and our nation will let him do that?\" The JCPOA is a 2015 deal between Iran and the P5+1 group of world powers, including the United States, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany. Under the deal, Iran must reduce its uranium stockpile by roughly 98%, phase out its centrifuges over the next 15 years, limit research activities, allow heightened inspections and ship spent fuel outside of the country.The Iranian President, who himself is expected to seek a second term next May, added that his country was not a threat to international peace and that the world was being misguided by Washington and Tel Aviv, according to Iranian state media IRNA.\"By capitalizing on the dispute over Iran's nuclear issue, they want to persuade others that the Islamic Republic establishes a threat against security and stability of its neighbors as well as Europe and the global peace,\" Rouhani told students. Trump's plansBut the agreement's future has been left in doubt in the wake of Trump's electoral victory. Throughout his race for the White House, the President-elect has been critical of the Iran deal, calling it one of the worst ever negotiated and pledging to renegotiate its terms. \"When I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran,\" Trump said in a USA Today op-ed in September last year.   While Trump made no mention of the deal in his video outlining his first 100 days in office, one of his foreign policy advisers confirmed the President-elect's desire to amend the nuclear agreement a recent radio interview. \"'Ripping up' is maybe a too strong of word, he's going to take that agreement, it's been done before in international context, and then review it,\" Walid Phares said on BBC radio in November. Sanctions to be extended?Meanwhile, Iran has threatened the Obama administration against signing a 10-year extension of tough economic sanctions, which was approved by the US Senate last week. \"The US, as a part of the five plus one, is one of our enemies and wants to pressure us. There is no doubt about that. We have to resist, be steadfast and find a way to counter it,\" Rouhani said, according to IRNA. \"They may break the nuclear agreement. They have already done so by extending the d'Amato Law (the Iran Sanctions Act). If this measure is actually implemented, then it would be a clear breach of the nuclear agreement and will cause us to react very harshly and severely.\"Rouhani said a committee tasked with \"monitoring the implementation of a nuclear agreement with six world powers\" will \"decide on how to respond to the US Congress' recent extension of a piece of anti-Iran legislation\" on Wednesday, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. \"Even if the US President declares invalid part of the bill ratified at the US Congress, we will react to the level of JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) violation that has already been committed,\" Rouhani said.US senators voted overwhelmingly in favor of a continuance of the Iran Sanctions Act, which they believe is needed to ensure Iran doesn't violate the terms of the recent international accord to curb its nuclear program.President Obama has already faced calls from the Republican leadership asking his administration to halt efforts to facilitate companies doing business with Iran throughout the transition months. \"President-elect Trump deserves the opportunity to assess United States policy toward Iran without your administration imposing or implementing additional measures that could complicate the incoming administration's ability to develop its policy,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce wrote in a letter to Obama.

Look at me!\" architecture we have learned to expect from the most celebrated 21st-century architects. But as Richard Rogers, chairman of the RIBA International Prize jury, is at pains to stress, \"this is a prize for a building, not an architect.\"What a building must do is to work well for those who use it and for the city it belongs to. Flanked by roaring urban motorways, this concrete megastructure, designed by Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara and their team in Dublin -- in collaboration with local partners Shell Arquitectos -- is truly a part of the Lima landscape. How so? The city is framed and shaped by a wall of towering vertical cliffs dropping down to the Pacific Ocean, and by a plethora of \"huacas,\" those monumental stepped shelves ancient and Inca civilizations built here for religious and civic ceremonies. Not only is the new university building cliff-like, but it also hosts any number of 21st-century huacas of its own: outdoor spaces between teaching blocks and on several levels where students can congregate, or simply stare across to the ocean and to the mountainous landscape beyond the city.Because Lima's climate is mild all year round despite its tropical setting  -- thanks to the cooling influence of the Humboldt Current that laps against its vertiginous shores -- the UTEC building boasts as many outdoor as indoor spaces. There is little need for air-conditioning.If the north face of the building -- curving in a boomerang shaped arc along the motorway -- is monumental, to baffle noise and shade the interior, its counterpart, the south face, is a thing of cascading terraces that, soon enough, will overflow with brightly colored bougainvillea. Civic duty\"It'll be rather like Machu Picchu,\" says Philip Gumuchdjian, one of the five architect judges of the RIBA International Prize. \"Choosing a winner from six impressive yet very different finalists was always going to be difficult, but we were looking for a design that somehow came from the culture of the site while promising those who use it a fresh way forward in their own lives.\"\"It's had a real impact on the students and faculty,\" says Carlos Heeren, UTEC's CEO. \"Its open spaces push their ideas to the limits, its solid structure makes them feel safe to explore and take risks, and its elegant lines remind us that beauty can be found even in concrete.\" The building has attracted government departments, hospitals and other Lima institutions to study and learn from its solid, yet open plan; its powerful yet cosseting form.  This is an inclusive and empowering building. These virtues are evident at every turn through its complex section -- the view, that is, through its structure. Here, there are few corridors. Instead, rooms seem perched along walkways, one cantilevered above another. What seems like such an impenetrable architectural outcrop from the motorway proves to be remarkably permeable, almost as if the ocean had carved caves and grottoes through fissures in its apparently invincible facade, and the city itself had seeped inside. Constructed from a single material -- white concrete -- the building is far more colorful than might be supposed. Eventually, this will be due in no small part to tropical plants reaching down its south face. Yet even now, spectacular sunsets bring varying color to this concrete cliff of a building. The stuff of meteorological sorcery, summer sunsets here are known as \"cielos de brujas\" or \"witch skies.\" Inside the interlocking internal spaces of the building, sunlight and shadows dance the day away.This is very much a building that needs to be experienced if it is to be understood. UTEC is not just architecture for the eyes, but, as Yvonne Farrell says, \"for all the senses.\" Through much of the building you can feel the ocean breeze, hear the sound of voices echoing through its spaces and experience innumerable shades of daylight. Grafton Architects see UTEC as a building concerned with the totality of architecture.As Billie Tsien, a distinguished American architect and RIBA  juror, puts it: \"UTEC is an exploration both in terms of material and, socially, as a work in progress. You have the feeling that it will only improve over time.\"Take a virtual tour of the RIBA International Prize shortlist here.

{"_id":"Uganda is shutting down schools funded by Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates","articleText":" (CNN)A legal tug-of-war between Ugandan authorities and a for-profit international chain of schools has led to the education provider being ordered to shut down in a matter of weeks, leaving the lives of thousands of pupils in limbo.Uganda's High Court has described the Bridge International Academies (BIA) -- which is funded by the likes of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg -- as unsanitary and unqualified, and has ordered it to close its doors in December because it ignored Uganda's national standards and put the \"life and safety\" of its 12,000 young students on the line. The Director of Education Standards for the Ministry, Huzaifa Mutazindwa, told CNN that the nursery and primary schools were not licensed, the teachers weren't qualified and that there was no record of its curriculum being approved.\"The Ministry does not know what is being taught in these schools which is a point of concern to (the) government,\" Mutazindwa said.The low-cost education provider, which has 63 campuses across Uganda, is allowed to remain open until December 8 to allow students to sit for exams and finish third term. This was after BIA secured an interim court order that restrained the government from closing its schools until its main case for stay could be heard in court.For its part, BIA — which runs more than 400 nursery and primary schools across Africa — has continuously denied the allegations that have been made by the government.\"There's a lot of miscommunication and a lot of very serious, unfounded allegations. We would like to be given the opportunity to explain ourselves ... The Ministry has been unwilling to give us an audience to set the record straight,\" Uganda's BIA director, Andrew White, told CNN.In a statement, BIA addressed eight allegations that have been made about its operations. It said it teaches the Ugandan curriculum, all schools have good sanitation facilities and that the majority of their teachers are certified and registered. Those who aren't certified and registered, it said, are attending in-service training.When asked why the allegations were made if they weren't true, White said: \"We definitely feel like a lot of pressure has been applied to have a particular view of Bridge that is a negative one.\"He suggested that the opposition against BIA was because the campuses competed against local state-run and private schools.\"I don't think the government is threatened by Bridge, but I think lobby groups are trying to make the government and ministry feel like they should be,\" White said.A private institution 'profiting from the poor'One educational advocacy group agrees with the Ugandan authorities' decision to close BIA.President of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Camilla Croso, told CNN that the quality of their schools is \"totally inadequate and unacceptable.\"\"They are profit making enormously,\" she said. \"It's very indecent because they are looking at poor people as a profitable market.\"\"It really is incompatible to have human rights and profit making because you are motivated and act in completely different ways.\"Salima Namusobya, the Executive Director for the Initiative for Society and Economic Rights (ISER), also agreed with the closure and told CNN that BIA's intentions were insincere.\"(BIA) has come into the country and not discussed with the regulators and set up a massive project,\" she said, adding that privatization of education goes against human rights principles -- particularly if it targets the poor.\"I think there's some level of arrogance that comes with this and I really think they're for the profit and not to assist the children.\"'Standardized' and 'scripted' educationCritics allege that BIA's education methods are not transparent, and that their approach is standardized and scripted.\"You can't call it an education that Bridge is offering,\" Croso said.\"You have technology -- like tablets -- often standing in place of teachers and you have very scripted classes that tell the teachers exactly what to do and when -- so you don't have any sort of autonomy and you can't improvise.\"She said teachers needed to understand the topics so they could panel it. \"Education has nothing to do with that (standardization) -- it's about debating, thinking and discussions.\"Croso said that instead, society should demand that governments \"step into their responsibility\" to ensure it is putting resources into quality education.Namusobya from ISER said she believes BIA causes segregation between the poor and rich.

Parents for the first time see their kids wanting to go to school and they have children who are actively doing their homework every day.\"While BIA has not yet evaluated the performance of their children in Uganda, in Kenya BIA found that is students \"outperform their peers in public schools in basic literacy and reading.\"\"We have a track record for academic success ... The model is very similar in Uganda and we expect in 2017 they will also excel.\" White said. He said BIA uses technology to help its teachers provide a \"holistic\" education.\"Bridge does not believe technology can replace a teacher ... We've spent millions of dollars to ensure our teachers have the resources and skills to make sure they can provide our pupils with the highest possible education.\"He said if those lobbying against the organization \"came and engaged\" with their teaching and learning they \"would see that it is extremely interactive\" where teachers engaged with their pupils and worked equally as hard on the strong and weak performers.

{"_id":"Uncommon poise: Officer's quick action saves young hostage","articleText":"Watch \"New Day\" and \"CNN Newsroom\" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty.Midwest City, Oklahoma (CNN)It was such a quiet Monday afternoon on the streets of this Oklahoma City suburb that David Huff was thinking of sneaking in some sunset fishing before heading home.But just after 3 p.m. on June 17, 2013, the call shot across Midwest City Police Department radios. Across the street from the police station, in a Walmart grocery store, a man had snatched a young girl and was holding her at knifepoint in front of her mother and stunned shoppers.\"All the people that are first responders, we all know that in our mind. We know that the next call could be the one that changes your life. It could be the next thing that ends your life,\" police Maj. David Huff said.Huff and Detective Darrell Miller, trained hostage negotiators, raced out of the station and within minutes came face to face with Sammie Wallace, who was holding a knife to 2-year-old Zoey Keating's stomach.Huff, 50, has rarely spoken publicly about the dramatic events that unfolded during a volatile 30-minute hostage standoff. During an emotional interview with CNN, his eyes often welled with tears.He talked about dealing with the \"tough stuff,\" admitting that he still beats himself up, struggling with the horror of what he was forced to do. \"There is a lot of tough stuff to deal with. Taking someone else's life. Cop for 26 years, and I never fired a shot at another human being. Ever,\" said Huff.Huff hopes his story and his journey over the past three years will help other police officers learn to cope with the stress of what they confront on any day in the line of duty.Huff was one of 13 police officers awarded the Medal of Valor by President Obama on May 16 for his \"uncommon poise to end the result of a dangerous hostage situation.\"   June 17, 2013After shoppers' 911 calls poured in, Huff and Miller calmly walked into a terrifying scene.\"We wanted to keep him calm,\" Huff said. \"He was in this manic state where he was basically blurting out statements.\"Huff and Miller suspect that Wallace was mentally ill, which made persuading him to let Zoey go difficult. They say Wallace was highly agitated. Surveillance video captured Wallace wandering the store for several minutes, pushing an empty grocery cart, before grabbing Zoey from her mother's cart. Alicia Keating, Zoey's mother, said it was \"unreal.\" She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Wallace holding a knife.    \"I just stared at him like he was crazy,\" Keating said. \"When he started to walk away with Zoey, that's when I started screaming, 'Somebody help! This man has my baby!' \"Just two minutes after the initial 911 calls, the first police officer arrived on the scene, walking back to the frozen meat section to assess the situation and help keep Wallace cornered.    Shortly after, Huff and Miller arrived and immediately went to work.The store was cleared of shoppers, and Zoey's mother was moved away. It was now Wallace holding Zoey, talking to Huff and Miller alone.They tried various techniques to get Wallace to calm down and release the girl. They brought him a chair and tried to reason with him, but he was frequently incoherent. Tension was escalating. Miller described him as getting more and more \"amped up\" as the conversation deteriorated.  \"When he started to speak, and he started making statements about the cameras are all watching us, it's the Illuminati. And George Bush is watching us. And he made reference to the CIA and that type of thing,\" Huff said.    \"We got the feeling right off the bat it was probably somebody who was mentally ill.  And to go even further, those types of statements we knew usually come from someone who has paranoid schizophrenia.\"   About 34 minutes after Huff and Miller arrived, the situation unraveled. Wallace threatened to end Zoey's life, demanding that the officers bring in a Dallas police officer with whom he went to school. As his demands weren't met, he started a 60-second countdown, moving Zoey closer to his chest and the knife closer to her throat.   \"Looking at the way he was acting and the things he was doing, I absolutely took him at his word that when he got down to zero, he would hurt Zoey,\" Huff said. \"I had it in my head that when he gets close to five, I'm going to take action.  I said it in my head, the only way Zoey doesn't get hurt is if the barrel of my gun is touching his head.\"When Wallace counted down to five, Huff said, he wouldn't wait any longer. \"I had to take one large step and had to do it,\" Huff recalled.   On the surveillance video, just as he had planned, Huff swiftly moves the gun right behind Zoey's body and fires one shot directly into Wallace's head.  Wallace collapses in the chair. In an instant, a team of officers converges and scoops Zoey from Wallace's arms. He was bleeding from the head and was still holding the knife in his left hand, according to the police report.     The video then shows Huff spinning away in a rush of emotion. He leans over the shelves of the meat aisle, punching the wall. The reality that his horrific moment is finally over sinks in.\"I didn't know if he had already stabbed her,\" an emotional Huff said of Zoey. \"When I picked her up, my intention was that I was going to run her back to the ambulances. Darrell grabbed her from me without missing a beat and ran her back.\"'He's my superhero'For the first year after the incident, Huff said, he did the \"cop thing\" and pretended that \"nothing bothered him.\"\"The things you see and are exposed to, you kind of put that in a box in the back of your mind and you say, 'OK, that's the bad stuff. We're not going to think about that.' \"Huff said that being honest and going through the emotions was key to him moving past his frequent feelings of darkness. He said other officers told him he handled the situation perfectly, but in Huff's mind, a perfect situation would have been everyone walking out of the store alive, even Wallace.\"There's a feeling of failure. I know in my logical mind that taking his life most likely saved Zoey's life.  And in my logical mind, I know that is the choice that had to be made.   But you still have this feeling that you failed, because if you had succeeded, you would have thought of some way to do this without taking a life.\"  It took him about a year to want to watch the surveillance video. He credits openly discussing the day with Miller and others with helping end his internal struggle. \"I was angry.  I wasn't angry at Sammie Wallace. I was angry that he made me do it.  And at that point, I thought that Zoey had already been cut or stabbed and that I waited too long,\" Huff said, wiping away tears.  \"They finally came around and said, 'She doesn't have a scratch on her.'  That was the best part.\"       Alicia Keating, Zoey's mother, heard the gunshot inside the store and feared the worst. She then saw Miller racing toward her with Zoey covered in blood.  Zoey was not injured, and Keating felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Three years later, she's grateful for officers like Huff.\"I saw for myself, firsthand, how scary their job must be,\" Keating said. \"And how brave they are.\"Zoey, now 5, calls Huff her superhero who \"saved the day.\"\"Don't tell Zoey this, but I'm not a superhero.  But hearing it from that beautiful child, I'm telling you, that right there will make your chest stick out for sure, \" Huff said with a huge smile.  \"It wasn't really any type of hero deal. It was a chain of a bunch of people being involved in a divine intervention.  Because there were a bunch of heroes in the room that day.\" Watch \"New Day\" and \"CNN Newsroom\" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/06/03/health/beyond-the-call-huff/index.html"}
{"_id":"Undocumented immigrant mom wants Trump to walk in her shoes","articleText":"Oklahoma City (CNN)With tears in her eyes Lili explains her deportation contingency plan.   She plans to sell her house and take her three youngest children to Mexico. Her eldest children, who are 17 and 15, want to stay in Oklahoma to work and help her make a living, she says. \"It's heartbreaking to think about that,\" Lili says, her voice cracking.  \"We've always been together.\" That's why Lili, who is only sharing her first name, says she challenges President-elect Donald Trump to live the life of an undocumented immigrant for one day.  If he did, she says, \"it would open up his heart\"  because of the pain and struggles that immigrant mothers like her live everyday. \"I want him to share one day of having to live in the shadows,\" Lili says. \"I want him to put himself in my shoes.\" Lili has lived in Oklahoma City for 20 years.  She was brought to the United States from Mexico as a child and now has five children of her own.  They are all US citizens, ages 2 to 17. She says she feels threatened in a Trump America because of the President-elect's promise to undo President Obama's 2012 executive action on immigration. She qualified for DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program created through  that executive action. It gave people who came to the United States as children a temporary stay in the United States in 2012.  But her temporary work permit expires in January, when President-elect Trump takes office. \"I would become illegal again,\" Lili says.  \"I would have to leave the country.\" \"I wish Donald [Trump] would see what we have to go through,\" she adds.  \"He has kids.  Would he like for his kids to be taken away from him?\" Widespread fearHundreds, perhaps thousands, of immigrants in Oklahoma share Lili's anguish.  Of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants across the United States, about 95,000 of them are in Oklahoma, according to the Pew Research Center.  Melissa Lujan, an immigration lawyer in Oklahoma City, says her phone has not stopped ringing since the election.  Her clients, she says, want to know how to survive a Trump presidency. \"[For] most people, the biggest fear that they have is that immigration is going to come to their door tomorrow, pick up their family members and take them away,\" Lujan says. Lujan says children also fear their parents will get deported while they're at school. To prepare for what some immigrants see as an Armageddon, Lujan says, they are spending as little money as possible, putting their homes up for sale and checking with immigration attorneys about their options.  And while she wishes she could have words of hope for them, Lujan says their fears are justified.  If President-elect Trump keeps his word, she says, they could all end up deported. \"We have no idea what is going to come from the next administration,\" Lujan says.  \"And the President completely has the control to take some pretty significant action.\"Mass exodus of immigrants Oklahoma City has seen this widespread fear in the immigrant community before.   It happened in 2007, when HB 1804, an immigration bill passed by the Oklahoma Legislature, became law.  At the time, it was one of the strictest state immigration laws in the country.  Among other things, it made it illegal to transport or house an undocumented immigrant. For Lili, it was a nightmare.  The terror was unleashed, she says, when immigration agents knocked on her door on her son's birthday. She was fingerprinted and then let go, she says.  But the word on the street about \"redadas,\" or immigration raids, spread quickly, she remembers.  And so did the fear. In a panic, Lili says she fled to another state, leaving her US-born children behind with family. \"I would hate to go through that again,\" Lili says.  \"I slept in my car for like two weeks.\" She remembers seeing vacant homes in the immigrant community as she drove out of town. The people who stayed behind, she says, avoided going to the store; some stopped sending their children to school. Lili returned to Oklahoma City three months later, when she thought it was safe to return, and because she couldn't live without her children. \"I have no kids, I have no life,\" Lili says. Crime went unreported According to Oklahoma City police spokesperson Capt. Paco Balderrama, one of the unintended consequences of the 2007 state immigration law was the under-reporting of crime in the immigrant community. The immigration law required law enforcement to make an effort to determine citizenship in some arrest cases.  And even though police were not raiding people's homes, says Balderrama, the perception that they were became reality for many immigrants. \"The root fear is that the police are going to become, basically, that door-to-door extension of immigration laws,\" Balderrama says. \"And historically, it's never been our role. Never. That would be a new role for law enforcement, despite what people say.\" When asked if the fear of deportation led to unreported crime, Balderrama says, \"Absolutely.\" The police department responded to the widespread fear by reaching out to the Hispanic community through appearances on Spanish language radio and television, expanding the bilingual police unit and translating police report forms to Spanish. \"A lot of people criticized us for that [and say] 'Why do you do that? They should learn how to speak English.' Well it doesn't help us to not have those documents. To have them not fill out a police report,\" Balderrama says. Paralyzing fear post-election Lili remembers feeling paralyzed with fear in 2007 after the state immigration law passed in Oklahoma.  But the fear of a Trump America is much worse for her, she says, because this time, the threat of deportation is not isolated to her state, it's nationwide.  It's a looming worry, she says, that would ultimately separate her from her children.  For now, she kisses them goodbye every morning when she drops them off at school, cherishing every moment she shares with them.

But before putting his slightly ailing body through a final onslaught of winter training, a movie documentary plotting his path to a third and final Olympic sprint treble at Rio in August will be released globally in cinemas next week.\"I Am Bolt\" is the brainchild of British brothers Ben and Gabe Turner, whose directing show reel includes \"The Class of '92\" -- the story of Manchester United's fabled footballers -- and \"In The Hands of the Gods,\" which follows a group of young men seeking to meet Diego Maradona.They were given unprecedented access to the Jamaican sprint legend -- the film opens with Bolt ironing his clothes.It highlights the occasional boredom of being locked away in a hotel room for much of a season, as he flits from driving a speedboat and quad-bike racing to singing on a Segway when unable to sleep in the middle of the night.'Everyone knows Bolt'Among those to feature are Justin Gatlin, arguably Bolt's greatest rival and the man who has come closest to toppling him from his sprint hegemony.\"Bolt's the ultimate showman,\" Gatlin tells CNN. \"We've never seen anyone like him. He's done so much for the sport.\"When you think of football, you think of Messi and Ronaldo. With basketball it was always Michael Jordan. You mention track and field, and most people's first thought is Usain Bolt. Everyone knows Bolt.\"Gatlin has lost count of the post-race press conferences at major championships where, vanquished again, he has sat alongside Bolt under the media spotlight.What pervades first and foremost is a genuine mutual respect between them. A telling moment of the film is Gatlin's insistence he would win Rio gold -- and Bolt admitting it was the catalyst to motivate himself when struggling in pre-Games training.\"I remember watching the Beijing Olympics in 2008 when I was out,\" says Gatlin, who was serving a drugs ban at the time. \"I watched him and remembered thinking I wanted an Ali-Frazier rivalry, and I wanted to push him to get to the top of the podium.\"Read: Is Bolt the greatest athlete of all time?'Sprinting's about the alpha male'If Bolt's career had not coincided with Gatlin's, the American could have won many more global titles. So does he regret that his career timed with that of Bolt at his peak?\"No way man,\" he says. \"I've had rivalries before that push you, like Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell, and then there was Bolt. But if he wasn't there I wouldn't have been consistently running 9.7 or 9.8 seconds. \"He brought that out in me. He's such a great competitor, he always brings his 'A' game, and I've enjoyed that so much.\"Gatlin remembers seeing the fear factor Bolt instilled in his rivals in 2008, something he insists he never suffered from -- although his stumble with 100-meter victory in sight at last year's world championships in Beijing would suggest otherwise.\"Sprinting's about the alpha male, but you could see the fear he'd instilled in the others,\" Gatlin says. \"Already before they took to the line, they had doubts in their minds and that's because of Bolt.\"As rivals, they have mostly kept each other at a distance, but they've let their hair down on occasion.\"I remember we drank some bottles and partied until the sun came up,\" Gatlin recalls of a night in Zurich. \"We had a good time, he's chilled, he's a cool dude and he's got real swagger.\"'We're like family'Bolt has a tight-knit unit around him -- his best friend and manager Nugent \"NJ\" Walker, who declined to be interviewed by CNN, and his agent Ricky Simms look after his affairs on and off the track.Both men star in \"I Am Bolt,\" although in Simms' case he says \"reluctantly.\" The Irishman first came across Bolt when he won the junior world 200-meter title in Kingston in 2002. Bolt was then 15, while most of his rivals were in their late teens and early twenties.Simms, himself a former runner, was one of the agents proposed to Bolt and his parents, and they went with him.\"There was so much potential then but you never know for sure how things will turn out with injury,\" Simms says from his home in Monaco. \"It's been a great journey and we've worked extremely closely in a very small team. We're almost like a family.\"'Refreshingly honest'Simms has seen Bolt grow from a shy boy into a towering 6-foot 5-inch colossus of the track, one of sport's great entertainers.\"He's the same person if there's two people watching or two million,\" he insists. \"That's why people love him. \"We were trying to work out why he's so popular, and what he says is just cool and funny. Were I to say the same thing it just wouldn't be, people would be just like 'sit down.' \"He pulls it all off with a smirk and a smile. He's so honest and he just says it as he sees it. He's just refreshingly honest.\"Simms says the film shows that, behind the relaxed persona, Bolt works harder than most. He often gets up at five o'clock in the morning to beat the Jamaican heat, proving himself to be \"an animal in training.\"There are times when his coach Glen Mills works him to submission on the trackAnd despite his fame and fortune, the prima donna strops are in short supply. \"Nobody's 100% happy all the time so even he has his off days but, even with it, he's a nice person,\" Simms says.Businessman BoltWith his running days coming to an end, Bolt is approaching a career crossroads -- and he's already preparing for life off the track.\"He's invested in real estate, he's got some key sponsors and there's TV work, maybe even Hollywood,\" Simms says. \"We want him to be remembered as a legend of track and field but we want it to go beyond that. \"Take George Foreman, he's probably now more famous for his grill than his boxing, or Colin Jackson, who's better known for his TV presenting than his hurdling career.\"No diva\"I Am Bolt\" is an honest reflection of the world's fastest man, from his inability to solve a Rubik's Cube to his surprising level of anxiety before his opening race of the season.He says to camera: \"Am I still fast? I always worry, am I still fast? Am I still the fastest man in the world?\"Co-director Gabe Turner believes you get what you see with Bolt. \"His public and private persona is as close as anyone we've met in the public sphere. He presents himself 100% as he is,\" Turner told CNN, adding that he never witnessed any diva behavior from Bolt.  \"Remarkably not once. The only time he got remotely irritated was when we were at his house. He'd told us not to ring to make appointments but just to hang out whenever, and he only once got irritated when we asked if we could do this or that in our very British way.\"'The next Bolt'Bolt trains under Mills at Kingston's fabled Racers' Track Club, which has produced a multitude of track champions.Among its wider training group is up-and-coming British sprinter Zharnel Hughes, a 20-year-old who has already been labeled the \"next Bolt.\" Hughes says he revels in being able to see the nine-time Olympic gold medalist in action day in, day out.\"He's funny, he calls me captain when I'm at training because I want to be a pilot,\" Hughes says. \"So he'll salute me when I arrive at training.\"He likes to shout at my coach when I'm dying on the track after a hard session: 'Zharnel's time is up.' But the guy works really really hard, it doesn't just come easy.\"There are split family loyalties in Hughes' native Anguilla, a British territory. His Jamaican mother is a massive Bolt fan who battered a saucepan with a wooden spoon in celebration when he won at London 2012. And Hughes is not ashamed to admit she is torn if he races Bolt. \"I'm sure she picks me over Usain ... surely?!\"Read: Bolt's mom - 'I hope he settles down and gets married'Local boyIn Jamaica, everyone knows Bolt -- his face is plastered all over billboards, while it is not uncommon to see him around in Kingston.British author Richard Moore traveled to the Caribbean island for his book, \"The Bolt Supremacy,\" and the landlady at his bed and breakfast nonchalantly told the story of bumping into Bolt at the local bank.\"It's funny because he didn't use to be this showman,\" Moore says. \"I got that talking to one his teachers, and there's this great clip of him with the Jamaican team at the 2003 World Championships when he was there for the experience. He was just so awkward and shy, nothing like the Bolt we see today.\"I think the whole showman part came in as a way to help him relax for races.

McCarthy said the website aims to reach communities in Latin America, Africa and Asia, which have received less attention about child abuse than congregations in the United States and Europe have. The guidelines include verifying people's identities when recruiting clergy, employees and volunteers for Catholic church activities, and vetting them for criminal records.The website also recommends \"full information sharing\" when priests are seeking to transfer from one diocese to another.Critics of the Catholic Church say that for decades, bishops shuffled priests accused of abuse from one parish to another rather than confronting the problem.The website reinforces the official line that, when accusations surface: \"the Church will comply with the relevant authority.  This should include any civil requirements on mandatory reporting... There should be a clear statement about referral of criminal behavior to the police or relevant authority.\"The Vatican first reported comprehensive statistics two years ago on the number of priests who were removed from ministry for sexual abuse.Francis creates tribunal to judge bishops who fail to protect children From about 2004 to 2014, the report said, 848 priests were defrocked, with 2,572 receiving lesser penalties. The pace increased in the last two years of Pope Benedict XVI's pontificate, with 384 of those 848 being defrocked in 2011 and 2012.The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which handles abuse cases, told CNN Tuesday that no statistics were available for the outcome of sex abuse cases under Pope Francis.He became Pope in 2013.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/europe/vatican-child-abuse-website/index.html"}

{"_id":"Veteran, 89, posts ad looking for job to save him 'dying of boredom'","articleText":"London (CNN)When 89-year-old war veteran Joe Bartley placed an advertisement in his local paper in South Devon, England, last month looking for work he wasn't expecting much.\"Senior citizen, 89, seeks employment in Paignton area. 20hrs+ per week. Still able to clean, light gardening, DIY and anything. I have references. Old soldier, airborne forces. Save me from dying of boredom!\" the advert read.He says his phone has been ringing off the hook ever since.\"I've been flabbergasted. When I put the advert in I thought, 'Who is going to take any notice of a man seeking employment at age 89?'\" Bartley told CNN over the phone.Since Bartley took out advertisements in the Torquay Herald Express on November 16, and again a week later on November 23, he says he's been on \"telly\" and \"online,\" interviewed by press as far afield as Sweden.\"I have a cleaner here once a week. When she came to clean the flat this week she asked for my autograph,\" Bartley said, laughing.Crucially for Bartley, who says he wants to find regular work so that he can pay his bills and not have to rely on housing benefits, he's also been offered two jobs -- one at a supermarket and another at a café -- near his home.\"I get housing support, which is great, but I wanted to get a salary so I could pay my rent myself,\" Bartley said. \"Pay my own way, so I could feel like more of a man.\"Bartley was a member of the Air Force, and served in what was then known as Palestine, after World War II. \"I was in the 6th Airborne Division and worked as a wireless operator in Palestine, before it became the state of Israel.

{"_id":"Vic Mensa gets political: The people elected Hillary Clinton, 'but this isn't a real democracy'","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's victory based on the Electoral College -- and not the popular vote -- underscores that the American government is \"not a government of the people,\" rapper and activist Vic Mensa told CNN in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month.\"The people spoke and elected Hillary Clinton, but this isn't a real democracy,\" Mensa told CNN, a reference to how Clinton leads by 2 million votes in the popular vote count. \"... We're still operating as a nation off of rules and laws that were enacted as a slave-owning state.\"But Mensa, who voted for the Democratic presidential nominee despite being critical of her, said that Trump's win does come with a silver lining.How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016For some of the President-elect's most bitter opponents, a Trump win over Clinton could actually be a \"good thing,\" Mensa said, because Trump has forced America to come to terms with some of its darkest and ugliest truths -- racism is alive and well and now we have to confront it.\"We're not able to hide behind myths of this being a post-racial society because Donald Trump has outlined exactly how a large portion of America feels,\" Mensa said. \"They feel like they're losing their birth right as white people to be the masters of the universe, and they're losing this American dream that was sold to them where you're always supposed to have a leg up.\"CHECK OUT: #GetPolitical — A CNN Politics original seriesAs opposed to other politicians, who use politically correct, \"neutrally-worded messaging\" when discussing race relations, \"Donald Trump came without a poker face,\" Mensa said, and from Muslims, to Latinos, to African-Americans, he outlined his enemies clearly and his supporters no longer had to swallow or sugarcoat their racism.A message left with Trump's transition team for comment to CNN was not returned.\"Our nation has been built upon extreme racism and built on the backs of slaves and just because we don't have the same incarnation of that racism alive today doesn't mean that the mental constructs of it are not alive and well and thriving in our society,\" Mensa said.As hip-hop braces for a Trump presidency, Mensa said that it is up to Americans who disagree with Trump's view of the world to \"regroup and reassess\" ways to offset any harm that a Trump presidency could inflict on the civil liberties of people of color.But the 23-year-old, who spent Thanksgiving weekend at the Standing Rock Native American Reservation to protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline, warns that talking or protesting is not enough -- activists need to make their voices heard at the ballot box by participating in the 2018 congressional election and electing local officials who will champion progressive causes and protect civil liberties.Why police brutality is personalAn issue that is close to the Chicago native's heart and at the center of some of his music, most recently in \"16 Shots,\" is police brutality and institutionalized racism. \"16 Shots,\" which is a song off of Mensa's 2016 album, \"There's Alot Going On,\" chronicles the October 2014 police shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.Dashcam video of the shooting contradicted nearly everything police said happened the night McDonald died. It showed McDonald walking away from police as he held a four-inch knife, not lunging toward officers, as police had said.Officer Jason Van Dyke jumped out of his vehicle and pulled his gun, firing at McDonald six seconds after arriving on the scene and unloading every round from his gun in 15 seconds.McDonald was hit by bullets 16 times and the video appears to show the teenager getting hit by bullets even after he was on the ground. Mensa said that one of his best friends from the west side of Chicago, where McDonald is also from, was close friends with the teenager, so for the Chicago rapper, the McDonald's death hits especially close to home.He wrote \"16 Shots\" to \"give a voice to the young kids\" from his community.\"The compliments that matter to me the most are when a kid in my neighborhood runs me down on the skatebaord while I'm driving and he's like 'yo I got something in my heads phones now. You're speaking for us, G'\" Mensa said. \"I wrote that song to give him a voice.\" The rapper said that as a young black male, he was also targeted by police officers as early as the age of 11 and he wants critics of the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement to understand that people or color are not born will ill feelings towards police officers, but are driven to feel that way because \"we grow up black in America, as targets.\"\"We're not just born with hatred in our hearts against police officers,\" Mensa said. \"We're oppressed and we develop these attitudes because of being targeted from a very young age just for being who we are ... You chose to put on a badge and a uniform. I can't take mine off.\"Marlena Baldacci and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/politics/vic-mensa-donald-trump-16-shots/index.html"}
{"_id":"Vitamin D doesn't prevent disease for most, study says","articleText":" (CNN)Vitamin D supplements do not help prevent disease for the majority of people, according to a new study published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal.During the bleak winter months of short days and cloudy skies, many people may seek out the benefits of sunshine in bottle form and reach for supplements of vitamin D. Made naturally by the skin when exposed to sunlight, this vitamin is needed to maintain healthy bones, teeth and muscles and to prevent them from becoming brittle and at risk of fracture.But a review of evidence from clinical trials on the impact of supplements has found that attempting to get vitamin D through supplements is not so beneficial.\"We conclude that current evidence does not support the use of vitamin D supplementation to prevent disease,\" said Mark Bolland, associate professor of medicine at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in a statement. Bolland led the research with Alison Avenell, a clinical chair in health sciences research at the University of Aberdeen.According to the team, clinical trials have failed to show that supplementation reduces the risk posed by falls and fractures to bones and muscles. But they recognize that it may be beneficial in people who are at high risk, such as those in nursing homes and darker-skinned people living in colder climates. To those at risk, researchers do recommend supplements during autumn and winter but also suggest getting advice on how best to get vitamin D naturally. \"Vitamin D will protect people who are at high risk,\" Avenell said.Natural sourcesIn spring and summer in the far regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, such as the northern US and New Zealand, people tend to produce enough vitamin D through sunlight on their skin and foods in their diet. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium to promote bone growth.Getting enough vitamin D, calculated as 15 micrograms for ages 1 through 70 in the United States, also prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia -- bone softening -- in adults. \"We're taking about preventing these diseases,\" said Avenell.But during autumn and winter, levels drop. It helps to eat the right foods, such as oily fish, egg yolks, red meat and liver, to keep levels high inside the body -- which not everyone can achieve adequately. Fortified foods, including milk, cereals and spreads, provide the most vitamin D in the American diet, according to the National Institutes of Health. \"In the US, vitamin D supplementation (through food) is higher,\" Avenell said.In countries like the UK, however, foods are not fortified as often, and supplements are therefore recommended. Until recently, recommendations were mainly to people at high risk of rickets and osteomalacia, but this summer, Public Health England advised that everyone take the equivalent of 10 micrograms per day.\"That's a big change,\" Avenell said. \"We don't think the evidence supports the necessity for that during winter.\"In a separate article, also published Wednesday, Dr. Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, argued that the recommended dose is backed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which also reviewed the evidence. \"When the days are darker and shorter and sun exposure is minimal, people should consider a daily 10 microgram vitamin D supplement, as it's difficult to get enough through diet alone,\" he said in a statement. But Avenell's research argues that the supplements make no difference.\"They're unlikely to do any harm,\" she said. \"But in the adult population, supplementing at the Public Health England levels does not prevent falls or fractures.\"Research was also inconclusive on other benefits claimed to be associated with vitamin D. \"We didn't see any conclusive evidence of vitamin D protecting against other conditions like heart disease or cancer (either),\" she said.An ongoing debateThe pros and cons of vitamin D have long been debated, but with this review questioning their benefit -- except among those at high risk -- many experts have pushed back in fear of the consequences if people stop taking them.\"Failure to address low vitamin D status during childhood, adolescence, for women of childbearing age and in the elderly could have serious long-term implications for public health,\" said David Richardson, visiting professor of food bioscience at the University of Reading. \"Action is needed now in the face of growing evidence of a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency.\"Martin Hewison, professor of molecular endocrinology at the University of Birmingham, agreed.\"It is clear that people in the UK are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, particularly in winter,\" he said, though he highlighted Avenell's point that supplements are particularly \"relevant for people at high risk of deficiency: those with darker skin from African, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds; people who are confined indoors; and people who cover up their skin while outdoors.\"Hewison also highlighted various levels of confusion and unknowns that persist around the issue. \"There is still some debate about what levels of vitamin D count as deficiency, and this varies according to the disease being studied,\" he said.\"(But) the take-home message is that we need to know more about how vitamin D works before planning new clinical trials to assess its health benefits. In the meantime, Public Health England's vitamin D recommendations are conservative and sensible, and people should be following them.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/vitamin-d-supplements-winter/index.html"}
{"_id":"Voters in Italy, Austria send message to EU leaders: Hold on tight","articleText":" (CNN)Europeans rode an emotional roller coaster Sunday. Up, then down. The resignation of Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in the early hours of Monday signaled what so many had feared, that his referendum on political reforms inside Italy would reverberate across all of Europe.Hours earlier, European leaders had hailed pro-EU candidate Alexander Van der Bellen's trouncing of nationalist Norbert Hofer in Austria's Presidential election as a victory over nationalism.French President Francois Hollande tweeted the \"Austrian people have chosen Europe.\"Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said \"all of Europe is relieved.\" Both men are paying particularly close attention as they, along with the Dutch, face their own elections next year.In a Europe awash with an apparently infectious populism, how votes go beyond their borders is suddenly very relevant.Their relief over the Austrian vote was short lived. Renzi's referendum defeat hands Italy's EU skeptics a stronger mandate and possibly enough clout in Parliament or the polls to push their agenda.Could Italy leave the EU? The biggest winners will be former comedian turned politician Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement party (M5S). They are anti-EU and want Italy freed from the constraints of the European single currency. It's the sort of change the EU is unlikely to give easily, if at all. The stage is slowly being set for a possible Itexit. Renzi had been doing well in the polls until he staked his political future on the referendum. His enemies saw their chance and pounced, and that includes other anti-EU parties like the Northern League, or Lega Nord.The message for Brussels is clear; if anti-EU sentiment can bring down the Prime Minister then it might surely pluck Italy from the dwindling group of 27 nations.Austrian blow to far rightAustrians, on the other hand, have been swayed over the past six months to move away from Hofer's anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim message. An annulled election in May put him just 31,000 votes behind Van der Bellen. This time he trailed by 7%.Hofer said he wanted Austria to remain part of the EU but he wanted changes to Europe's open border policy, not the core ideal of the EU's founding fathers.But Hofer's appeal might have waned since May in part because of the EU's success in stopping migrants from getting to Austria's borders. The so-called Balkan route was shut down with the help of Turkey and Greece.So while last year close to one million migrants passed through Austria, helping Hofer's anti-migrant message resonate through Austria's eight million population, it had lost some of its potency come the December vote.French Nationalist Marine Le Pen responded to Hofer's loss with a tweet congratulating his Freedom Party for fighting \"with courage.\" \"They'll be victorious in the next legislative (elections)!\" she added.Her twitter feed quickly moved on to other topics, an effort it seemed not to dwell on the kick to the nationalist cause.Rise of nationalism?She didn't have to hold her silence for long however, no sooner were the Italian exit polls signaling Renzi's political demise, she tweeted \"well done to our friend Matteo Salvinimi for his victory of NO,\" congratulating the northern Italian nationalist.She went on to tweet, \"The Italians have moved away from Renzi and the EU. We must listen to this thirst for freedom and protection on nations!\"Le Pen's roller coaster went down and then finished high but the ride is far from over.Mainstream politicians have been struggling to grapple with her rise -- some point to frustrations over globalization, uncertainty about the economy and erosion of national identity -- even so they haven't found a fix.And while they take comfort in the victory of pro-EU President elect Alexander Van der Bellen, they will no doubt be pondering what his victory really means.  He isn't just Western Europe's first Green Party President, he is Austria's first President who isn't from the country's two principle political parties.Sunday's message is clear: European leaders need to brace themselves for a wild ride ahead.

It meant Russia's 68-man strong track and field team was forced to miss August's Rio 2016 Olympics, while then Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko was also banned from attending the event.\"Some progress has been made by RUSADA in its efforts to regain compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code,\" a WADA spokesperson told CNN. \"There remain, however, a number of challenges with the Russian anti-doping program that need to be addressed in order for RUSADA to regain code compliance.\"WADA said it has installed two international experts in Russia to ensure RUSADA can operate independently.\"WADA has provided RUSADA with a roadmap that it must follow in order to become re-compliant with the code,\" the spokesperson added. \"With regards to how quickly that can happen, the ball is in RUSADA's court.\"On Tuesday, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a new law to criminalize any encouragement for doping, national news agency Tass reported.Anyone found guilty of inducing an athlete to use drugs faces a fine of up to 1.1 million rubles ($11,400) or a jail term of up to three years, plus suspension from \"professional activities\" for up to five years, depending on the circumstances.Off micOn Sunday, WADA director general Olivier Niggli was caught off microphone at a press conference in Scotland telling newly re-elected president Craig Reedie that he's not keen to re-admit Russia. In a conversation filmed by Russia Today, Niggli said: \"It's good to say we're working with Russia, but don't give the impression that we're rushing.\" \"No, no,\" Reedie answered.\"I think be patient and ... we want them to get back, but not under any condition. Just be careful,\" Niggli said.\"Yeah, but I can be encouraging with (Vitaly) Smirnov (Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission's head),\" Reedie replied.\"Yeah, but not too much ... We aren't desperate for them (Russia) to come back,\" Niggli stressed. \"They can come back if they do the right thing,\" he added.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the comments as \"dirty statements.\"\"These are sports officials representing world sports that should be beyond politics but is always involved in it,\" she wrote on her Facebook page, Tass reported.\"From now on, we will compare every word uttered by these gentlemen with their deeds to make sure they do not contradict each other.\"READ: Hacks reveal medical data of sports starsDenialRussia has consistently denied accusations of state-sponsored doping, and Smirnov -- a former International Olympic Committee member -- reiterated this stance at last weekend's WADA Foundation Board meeting. \"Doping is not the problem of one specific country. We have to fight this evil together,\" he reportedly told delegates.WADA had called for a blanket ban of the Russian team at the Rio Olympics after a report in July by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren accused Russia of orchestrating a state-sponsored, four-year doping regime.READ: Russia counts cost of doping indiscretionsHowever, the International Olympic Committee ruled that individual sporting federations would decide if their Russian athletes could take part.Reedie was re-elected, unopposed, by WADA's foundation board in Glasgow despite criticism by some members over his calls for a total ban on Russia in Rio. \"It might not look like it, but we are making real progress now,\" Reedie told the UK Press Association. \"I am not walking away.\" More scrutiny to come?Russia's anti-doping practices may come under renewed scrutiny next month when McLaren publishes his final doping report on December 9, which will look at winter sports. The IOC announced on Monday it was retroactively disqualifying 12 athletes, including seven medal winners, from the 2012 London Olympics following re-analysis of stored samples.

{"_id":"WHO ends Zika public health emergency","articleText":" (CNN)The Zika virus outbreak and related clusters of microcephaly are no longer a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization said Friday. This ends the declaration made by the organization in February due to the simultaneous spread of the virus and \"extraordinary clusters\" of microcephaly among babies born in areas where the virus was spreading. \"We are not downgrading the importance of Zika. By placing this as a long-term program of work, we are saying Zika is here to stay,\" said Dr. David Heymann, the chairman of the emergency committee on Zika virus and microcephaly, which made the announcement. In February, it was not known that the virus was the cause of the neurological birth defect. In April, the WHO said the virus definitely causes microcephaly in babies and  Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults. \"The source of the concern was not that there was Zika, it was extraordinary clustering of microcephaly that hadn't been seen before at a time when lots of infection was occurring,\" Heymann said. The declaration put into motion research, coordination and funding to answer that and many other questions about the virus, which was initially thought to be a mild mosquito-borne disease. Now it's known that in addition to the devastating neurological complications it can cause, the virus can be sexually transmitted. \"There is still a lot of unknowns here, which is why it's so important to have a multiyear plan and program in place,\" said Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.   Although mosquito season has ended in some areas of the world and transmission of the virus has slowed, it is far from gone. \"This disease is like all endemic diseases that have a seasonal appearance,\" Heymann said.  That is why the WHO's emergency committee recommended the change announced today, emphasizing that Zika is still a high priority. Now, the organization will create a technical committee to handle Zika research, vaccine development and other efforts going forward. \"A robust longer-term technical mechanism was now required to manage the global response,\" the committee determined. Calling the WHO's action \"a reasonable decision,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, nonetheless said the organization \"should be prepared to re-examine the decision if, in fact, we have a resurgence of Zika in South America as we enter into the summer months of January and February in the Southern Hemisphere.\"Heymann said the WHO was prepared to do so.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that the move does not change the need to continue efforts to combat the virus and its effects. \"Zika infection continues to be a serious threat to pregnant women, babies born to pregnant women with Zika, and their families. There is still much to learn about the disease. We need to learn more about Zika and its associated complications of microcephaly and other brain abnormalities, such as when Zika infection poses highest risk to a fetus during pregnancy, and the magnitude of that risk,\" the statement said.As anticipated, the virus is continuing to spread around the world and is circulating in more than 60 countries and territories. Microcephaly and other neurological complications linked to the virus have been reported in at least 28 countries. Of the 2,300 confirmed cases of microcephaly, the majority have been in Brazil, where an increase in babies born with the condition was first seen last year. It's believed that this is only a portion of the actual number of such cases. Thus, the CDC said, \"It remains crucially important that pregnant women avoid traveling to areas with local transmission of Zika, because of the devastating complications that can occur in fetuses that become infected during pregnancy.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/who-ends-zika-public-health-emergency/index.html"}

{"_id":"Was it a bait and switch? Trump goes full Republican","articleText":"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \"Jimmy Carter\" and \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\" He is the co-host of the podcast, Politics & Polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)Was it a bait and switch? Throughout the Republican primaries, Donald Trump carved out stances that broke with longtime GOP orthodoxy. As a businessman who sometimes expressed support for Democrats and for positions favored by liberals in his home state of New York, Trump promised he would be an unconventional president capable of taking positions all along the political spectrum.But since he was elected President, Trump has named Cabinet members who hew closely to what Republicans have advocated for decades. In fact, it's starting to look a lot like Christmas for the Republican Party. For all the talk about how Trump would defy the Republican Party and challenge the status quo, his Cabinet picks have been remarkably consistent -- and conservative. It should have become clear when Trump announced that Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a staunch right-wing conservative who has been a strong opponent of abortion rights as well as LGBT rights, also skeptical of climate change and a champion of creationism, would take over the transition from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The recent announcement that US Rep. Tom Price, an ardent opponent of Obamacare, will head the Department of Health and Human Services is just one more piece of evidence that Trump will govern with a rightward team of conservatives surrounding him. Trump apparently is aiming to build a new Republican coalition that combines blue-collar workers with the rest of the existing conservative establishment.Some Republican commentators are still acting as if things are up in the air. In his most recent column, David Brooks of The New York Times said that Trump is a threat to the party loyalty that has dominated American politics. \"He is hostile to the Republican establishment,\" Brooks wrote. \"His proposals cut across orthodox partisan lines.\"   Heading rightIf people are waiting for him to moderate or for his presidency to cause a major rupture in the GOP, they might be waiting for a long time. Everything so far suggests he is planning to make some pretty radical moves to reverse most of President Barack Obama's policies and to go even further than that. For all the pleasantries that have been uttered between Trump and Obama, this President-elect is clearly is rightward-bound.The early announcements about his appointments set a clear tone. With \"alt-right\" favorite Steve Bannon as his senior adviser and Reince Preibus, who headed the Republican National Committee, as his chief of staff, Trump instantly put into place figures who could appeal to congressional Republicans, the conservative media and right-wing organizations that hover around sites such as Breitbart.com.Then Trump went even further. He announced that Sen. Jeff Sessions, an ardent opponent of voting rights and a fierce adversary of legal and illegal immigrants, such as opposing giving visas to many high-skilled workers, would head the Justice Department. That sent a clear signal to most people in Washington about the direction his policies would take. With Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general,  as his national security adviser, he has turned to someone who has argued that Islamism is a \"vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people\" and that it must be \"excised.\"  US Rep. Mike Pompeo, a conservative who was a driving force in the Benghazi investigation, heading the CIA sets up the agency to support an extremely aggressive stance in how the war on terrorism will be conducted.South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations, came into politics as a tea party Republican, endorsed by Sarah Palin in her run for governor, and has an extremely conservative voting record on almost every issue. To be sure, she lowered the Confederate flag from the state Capitol after horrendous racially charged shootings in South Carolina, but that is a long way from establishing that she is a moderate in general. Betsy DeVos, who will be the secretary of education, is one of the most prominent and fervent advocates of using federal money for charter schools. She also comes from a family that has donated enormous amounts of money to all sorts of conservative causes, effectively the Koch brothers of the Midwest.The transportation secretary-to-be, Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, had a solid, anti-union record when she was secretary of labor under President George W. Bush. Chao is well-networked in the most \"establishment\" Republican circles of Washington. As labor secretary, she drew criticism from Democrats for failing to investigate complaints from workers or to promote new health regulations. When 12 miners died in the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia, critics argued she had not conducted sufficient safety inspections in mines.   Strong signalsSome of the lower-level appointments have also sent congressional Republicans strong signals about where the administration will go. The announcement that KT McFarland, a former national security official and Fox News analyst, as deputy national security adviser pleased many hawks given her confrontational stands against Russia and, even more importantly, extremely tough posture toward Iran. While at Fox, McFarland responded to the terrorist attack in Brussels, Belgium, by saying that \"political correctness\" is \"getting us killed\"  by preventing the United States from rounding up Muslims. \"Either bomb Iran, or let Iran get the bomb,\" she also said in a statement of her policy toward the region.   Bringing Price on board to head the HHS is an equally radical statement. Getting rid of Obamacare has been at the top of the list for many Republicans since it was passed. Price has never been shy about his positions on the program. \"Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration blatantly ignored the voices of the American people and rammed through a hyperpartisan piece of legislation that will have a disastrous effect on our nation's health care system,\" the congressman said in 2010. Unlike some Republicans, Price has not softened his views since the program went into effect.While it will be difficult for congressional Republicans to make a direct assault on Obamacare in the coming year, the other way in which a conservative administration can effectively gut a policy is to put an opponent in charge of the agency that administers it. This was Ronald Reagan's strategy for much of the 1980s: undermine federal programs from within. That's why Reagan had Clarence Thomas, an opponent of affirmative action, head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or James Watt, an anti-environmentalist, as secretary of interior. With Price making big decisions about who should administer the program and how to direct resources within his agency, the Affordable Care Act will be vulnerable from day one even if it remains on the books.'Team of Rivals'?Even the so-called possible Team of Rivals appointments must be taken with a grain of salt. The possible appointment of Mitt Romney to be secretary of state has now become the chief question about whether Trump really wants a team of rivals and seeks to broaden his party. While it is true that Romney headed the anti-Trump effort within the GOP and there is no love lost between these men, a quick look at Romney's 2012 campaign is reminder of how far to the right he is willing to go when it suits his political purposes. Romney was extremely hawkish in his positions about Iran, remaining an opponent of any kind of nuclear deal, and surrounded himself with advisers who made extreme statements about the threats from Islam. He told voters that he could wage a war on Iran without congressional approval.   Although he differs from Trump in being more confrontational with Russia, something that would please most conservatives, there are not so many differences between them. Another alternative would be to name retired Gen. David Petraeus to be secretary of state. Notwithstanding the controversy this will generate given his own classification scandal, having him at State, with Flynn at the National Security Council and possibly Marine Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary -- breaking a 65-year tradition of not having military men in that role -- would stack much of foreign policy with officials oriented toward the use of force rather than steeped in diplomacy to handle relations overseas. When it comes to the Koch brothers, they have a lot to be excited about. While they stayed far away from Trump during the campaign, the President-elect is making a number of appointments of loyal Koch acolytes to his team. As Politico reported, his transition team as well as several administration picks have tapped into the Koch world, including White House counsel Don McGahn to transition team executive members such as Rebekah Mercer. Another Politico article noted how despite the President-elect's populist campaign Wall Street bankers and traders are celebrating the transition period as many major investors, from Wilbur Ross (expected to be the secretary of commerce) to Steven Mnuchin (secretary of treasury), have been coming in and out of meetings at the Trump White House-in-waiting on Fifth Avenue. So for all the talk about divisions within the GOP and Trump's unorthodox policy position, this is really looking like a very traditional Republican administration, and one that will veer to the right, not the center, on domestic and foreign policy. With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the GOP will be in a strong position to move public policy in pretty dramatic fashion over the coming two years. And with Democrats defending more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018, the policymaking window might be even bigger for this president than others have enjoyed in the past.","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/opinions/trump-appointments-bait-and-switch-zelizer/index.html"}

Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor.Wasserman Schultz cited Sessions' unsuccessful appointment to a federal district court by then-President Ronald Reagan, which sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racially tinged remarks. \"Let's remember that Jeff Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship by President Reagan and at the time was one of only two in 60 years to be rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee -- which was controlled by Republicans at the time -- because of his previous racist statements and really outrageous comments.\"RELATED: Sessions dogged by old allegations of racismLater in the interview, Wasserman Schultz weighed in on the emerging leadership battle for House Democrats, which was kicked off after Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced he would challenge current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her post.While Wasserman Schultz was careful to express admiration for both Ryan and Pelosi, she suggested that Pelosi's leadership experience would be critical for Democrats as they gird for legislative fights against the Trump administration. \"There is nobody in my mind that is more battle-tested and prepared, and frankly, savvy enough to be able to go toe-to-toe with Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership, and this really troubling and disturbing administration, than Nancy Pelosi,\" she said.

{"_id":"We have 20 years -- at the very most -- to prevent mass extinction","articleText":"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)The Earth's next mass extinction -- the first caused by people -- is on the horizon. And the consequences are almost unthinkably dire: Three-quarters of species could disappear. This has happened only five times in the planet's history -- including the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs.What's different now is that humans are causing these changes. How? Well, we're burning fossil fuels and consequently heating up the planet; turning massive chunks of land into farms; spreading invasive species and diseases around the world; boosting our own numbers and consuming more and more resources; and causing all sorts of trouble for the oceans, from overfishing to filling them up with plastic. (Did you know researchers expect the ocean to be equal parts fish and plastic, by weight, as soon as 2050?) This subject certainly is alarming, especially when you consider the global picture.Another frightening data point in this trend toward extinction emerged on Thursday in a report from the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental advocacy group. The report claims 58% declines in certain vertebrate animal populations since 1970 and says that if trends continue, then two-thirds of all of these individual birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals will be gone by 2020.Some scientists see those numbers as potentially misleading. Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke chair of conservation ecology at Duke University, told me that 58% is \"a fairly silly kind of number to report because it mixes what's going on in the ocean with what's going on in the land.\" He continued, \"It mixes studies of bird populations in Europe with mammal populations in Africa. It has very few data points in South America. The idea that you in the media can only handle a single number to summarize the state of the planet -- you should be insulted by that.\"I agree with Pimm that these numbers can be misleading, but that's only if people misunderstand them. I also spoke with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University. He told me the most important thing to remember is that this report is limited in scope -- it has little data from some important tropical regions, for example, and only covers animals with backbones. But it highlights an important and little-considered fact: It's not just that species are going extinct at an alarming rate -- at least 100 times what could be considered \"normal,\" and maybe much higher than that -- but that populations of still-common animals are declining very rapidly.\"I don't think I would quibble with the trend they're pointing out -- we're losing individuals of species and geographic ranges at a really rapid rate,\" he told me. \"If you keep that up, extinction of lots of species is inevitable.\"Importantly, the WWF report deals with individual animals disappearing, not with entire species. A mass extinction, by definition, means three-quarters of all species disappear. That could happen in 100 or 200 years, Barnosky said, but not by 2020.Don't look at that figure and think we have time to count our blessings. Barnosky told me we have maybe 10 to 20 years to stop the sixth extinction from becoming an inevitability. If we do nothing, expect three-quarters of species to disappear over the next century or two. In other words, what we do (or don't do) right now will shape generations on this planet.\"Yes, species are going extinct very, very much faster than they should be,\" Pimm said, \"which means we are depriving countless generations to come the extremely rich diversity we inherited from our parents.\"And others experts, including Paul Ehrlich, the Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University, say the sixth extinction is already here. \"We've probably lost, say, 200 species -- kinds of big animals -- over the last couple of hundred years, but we may well have lost on the order of a billion different populations,\" he said. \"We are basically annihilating the life on our planet and that is the only known life we know about in the entire universe. And it's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. And it's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done.\"Pimm told me we have \"about a human generation\" to do something before it's likely too late.\"If we don't start doing a lot of things to stop extinction, we are going to see very significant losses of species,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things we can do and I would rather concentrate on the positive (rather) than just wallow in this really appalling number\" presented by the World Wildlife Fund. \"In the last 50 years, roughly, we've lost 50% of the individuals in these species,\" Barnosky said. \"If we lose another 50% in the next 50 years we're down to 25% of the original. Basically, in a couple hundred years you'd have almost all of these species we're talking about blinking out -- if we keep going at that rate.\"We know how to slow the rate of extinction. We need to ditch fossil fuels to blunt climate change. We need to protect more of the land and ocean on behalf of biodiversity. (The biologist E.O. Wilson has called for half of the world to be protected, a bold and exciting proposition.) We need to stop the spread of invasive species, and we've got to get a handle on illegal trades like that in ivory, which Barnosky said could wipe out Africa's elephants in 20 years if poaching rates continue. The first step, however, is waking up to the crisis and its monstrous scope. \"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,\" he told me earlier this year, \"is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.\"I'd rather imagine a world where we stop anything close to that from happening.

More than 140 people were killed when several train cars derailed in northern Uttar Pradesh early Sunday morning. \"All of a sudden there was a massive jerk,\" Ravindra Pathak said in the aftermath of the deadly derailment.  \"Our heads collided with the roof of the carriage.\"Among the passengers were Rakesh Verma and his new wife, as well as other members of their wedding party. \"There's a little girl, she's two-and-a-half years old, we can't find her or my mother in the wreck,\" Verma's brother told CNN affiliate News 18. The train, which links the central Indian city of Indore to the city of Patna in its north east, was halfway through its journey when it went off the track near Kanpur, around 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.After almost an entire day of work, the site of the accident has now been cleared, Ahmed said. In total, 110 bodies have been identified, with 97 handed over to the victims' families. Around 50 people remain under treatment in hospital, of 169 injured. Terrifying accidentOne survivor told News 18 the train started shaking with \"screeching sounds\" early Sunday.\"I felt as though metal was clashing with metal, it was like a collision. My upper berth was almost tilted by the time the train halted,\" Shresth said. Shresth -- who goes by one name as do many people in India -- said he was one of the first to climb out of the wreckage. He was traveling with a friend to the city of Lucknow to attend an event, he said. When they tried to leave through one of the doors, they found the corridor littered with bodies, he said.\"I did not want to step on the bodies so we took the other door, but by the time we deboarded, all I could see were either dead people or children crying for their parents,\" Shresth said.The pair used GPS navigation to make their way to a nearby village hospital. Later they saw ambulances arrive.Shresth said the accident \"shook him for life.\"The crash sceneVideo from the scene showed mangled carriages flipped over on its side. Fourteen cars in the 23-car train derailed, Modak said.

{"_id":"Welcome to Duterte country ","articleText":"DAVAO CITY, Philippines (CNN)Davao City, on the southern Philippines' island of Mindanao, is the stronghold of the country's outspoken, unrepentant President Rodrigo Duterte. He was born and raised here. He served as the local mayor for seven terms. Even now, as President, he flies back and forth to Davao City, saying he prefers his own bed to sleeping in Manila's Malacanang Palace, the traditional home of Philippine leaders.The President has captured the world's attention with his combative and at times vulgar comments. He told the EU they could f**k themselves and called US President Barack Obama a \"son of a bitch.\" Despite longstanding diplomatic, military and financial ties with the US, he's made clear his intention to realign his international allegiances, cozying up to China and Russia. This weekend, he met with both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin before the APEC summit in Lima formally opened. He praised the latter for his \"firm\" character.Domestically, he's waging a brutal war on drugs that's claimed thousands of lives and attracted heavy criticism from human rights groups for its use of deadly extrajudicial force. But his neighbors are fiercely proud of their homegrown leader. On Duterte's street in the middle class Dona Luisa Phase 1 subdivision, vendors sell T-shirts, mugs and magnets promoting the President's tough guy image. Outside his house, tourists come to take photos with a life-size cut out. Houses along the street display Duterte portraits on their front gates.CNN visited his neighborhood to find out how locals think their President is faring.Anton Uy has high hopes for his country's president. \"I believe he can change the country,\" says this 16-year-old engineering student.Growing up in Davao, he says he felt really safe with Duterte as mayor. He's praying for the President, who he describes as \"courageous\" and \"determined.\"Although supportive of the President's war on drugs and his emphasis on education, Uy thinks the primary challenge facing the country is a lack of unity. He thinks Duterte can change this. The teenager's love for the President is clear. \"He never gives up.

He believes President Duterte was the best mayor Davao city ever had, so of course he's become the country's best president.He still refers to Duterte as \"our mayor.\" Isla remembers Duterte cleaned up the city \"step by step,\" instituting policies like a nighttime curfew and a strict speed limit to cut down on deadly traffic accidents.  In his opinion, these changes made Davao a safer place to walk around.\"We have seen what he has done in Davao. How sincere he is. What he says is from his heart.\"Isla explains locals are used to the foreign press continually misinterpreting what Duterte says, like his recent comments about severing ties with the United States.  READ: What happens if Rodrigo Duterte dumps the US\"We understand between the lines,\" he says, insisting Duterte never meant a full cut of US-Philippines relations. Jessie Adlao literally has President Duterte to thank for his job. He runs a stand on the same block as the President's house selling pro-Duterte T-shirts, magnets, stickers and mugs to tourists. Many call the President \"The Iron Fist\" or \"The Punisher.\" It's a good business for him, bringing in about $100 a day. Like 96.6% of voters here in Davao City, Adlao cast his ballot for Duterte. \"He is a good man,\" he says. \"He treats everyone equally. He doesn't see anyone as rich or poor.\"READ: Philippines mayor, bodyguards killed in shootout Specifically, he's impressed by the progress of the President's made in his war on drugs.

He decided to come because his father lived here at 19 and he wanted to experience the city.\"It's the place where you can walk freely and feel safe at night,\" he says.He thinks the President's fight against drugs will benefit good the country. Addressing the problem will help the economy, he says.  \"Poverty makes you do drugs and taking drugs makes you poor.\"When it comes to the United States, Repique hadn't heard about Duterte's comments about a separation, but he doesn't like when the president calls Obama names or tells him to go to hell.  READ: 'Philippines stumbling towards dangerous isolation'\"He shouldn't have said that, because he represents the country, the Philippines.

{"_id":"West Virginia man accused of killing teen who bumped him ","articleText":" (CNN)William Ronald Pulliam appeared unrepentant after fatally shooting a teenager during a confrontation outside a West Virginia discount store.\"The way I look at it, that's another piece of trash off the street,\" Pulliam allegedly told police, according to a criminal complaint. But the 62-year-old man, in a jailhouse interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, categorically denied making that statement. He said he feared for his life when 15-year-old James Means allegedly pulled a gun on him. The complaint did not say Means had a gun. \"I mean, believe me, I did not want to kill anybody, but they're not going to kill me,\" Pulliam, wearing an orange jailhouse uniform, told the station Tuesday. Pulliam has been charged with first-degree murder for an incident that police and witnesses say started with two strangers bumping into each other Monday night. He has not yet been assigned an attorney by the public defender's office. The suspect told police he had dinner immediately after the alleged crime and then visited a female friend -- in whose home the .380-caliber revolver used in the shooting was found, according to the criminal complaint filed in Kanawha County magistrate court.'I felt my life was in danger'In the jailhouse interview, Pulliam said shooting was his only option.\"I felt my life was in danger,\" he told the station. \"I'm sorry, but I'm 62 years old. I'm not going to take a bunch of punks beating me up.\" Friends of the victim told police that Pulliam and Means bumped each other outside a Dollar General store on Washington Street East in Charleston, according to the complaint.Words were exchanged but Pulliam entered the store.When Pulliam came back outside, one of Means' friends said, the teen and the older man again had a \"verbal dispute,\" the complaint said.Means crossed the street to confront Pulliam, who fired two shots at the teenager, according to the friend.Pulliam told WCHS that he saw three teens outside a house as he was walking to the store. They were laughing, he said. One of them cursed him when he got closer. \"What the ... did you say to me?\" Pulliam recalled asking the teenager. The teen flashed a gun, Pulliam told the station. The friends encouraged Means to shoot but Pulliam continued into the store.Pulliam said in the interview that he walked on the other side of the street when he left the store to avoid trouble but that Means approached him and taunted him with a gun. \"I just shot him,\" Pulliam told the station.He added, \"I work. I'm a good citizen. I don't do anything to anybody.\"Pulliam said race did not factor into the confrontation. He is white, Means was black. \"I don't care if they're white or black,\" he told WCHS. \"Nobody is going to do me like that. It doesn't make any difference if he's black. My God, everybody I live around over there is black. I get along with all of them. Ask them.\"In an email statement, the FBI said it was monitoring the case. \"If in the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal civil rights violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,\" the statement said. Pulliam may not have had right to own gunIt appears that Pulliam should not have been armed. He pleaded no contest to domestic violence charges in 2013, according to WCHS. Federal law prohibits anyone convicted of domestic violence charges from possessing a gun. Means' relatives, meanwhile, remembered the teenager as smart, funny and loving. \"James could put a smile on anybody's face no matter the situation,\" his aunt, Teresa Means, told the station.The teen's mother, Nafia Adkins, said: \"My son's in a safer place now, and we all love him.\" The family, which has set up a GoFundMe page for funeral expenses, made a plea to Means' friends: Let justice take its course. Don't seek revenge. Don't post messages of hate on social media. \"I'm going to leave everything up to the courts to take care of this man and do whatever they have to do to make him be punished,\" Adkins told the station. \"We don't hold a grudge, so nobody else should hold a grudge. We all have to forgive and let everything take its place.\"CNN's Tony Marco, Mary Kay Mallonee, Connor Spielmaker and Tanika Gray contributed to this report.

{"_id":"What Fidel Castro funeral RSVPs say about the world","articleText":"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Fidel Castro's funeral will bring together an unlikely mix of world leaders, royalty, Marxist guerillas and Hollywood actors.So, who's coming?The official guest list goes on for 20 pages, with a varied group of VIPs such as former Spanish King Juan Carlos I, a vice president of the North Korean worker's party and left-leaning actor Danny Glover.Castro's wife and children, whose existence for years was a state secret, could make a rare appearance. Castro's long-estranged sister Juanita Castro said she would not be leaving exile in Miami to attend the funeral.Nearly every Latin American head of state will be on hand, though.The arrival of left-leaning presidents of Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela is no surprise and in fact speaks to how much the world has changed since Fidel Castro took power in 1959.Shortly after the Cuban revolution, every country in the Western Hemisphere except Mexico broke relations with Cuba, alarmed at Castro's growing alliance with the Soviet Union.But thanks to a recent boom in leftist governments -- some Castro helped to install, like that of Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega -- the region is now chock-full of Cuba allies.Many observers will be watching for the interaction between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro.  Since late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez began to copy Cuba's socialist and fiercely anti-US government style, Cuba and Venezuela have all but melded into one country.But with oil prices plummeting, Venezuela has been forced to cut precious oil subsidies to Cuba, leading many to wonder if the Venezuela-Cuba love affair is on the rocks.Both Colombian government officials and their longtime adversaries the FARC guerrillas are  attending. That speaks volumes about how Cuba has changed its role in world affairs.For decades, Cuba supported the Marxist guerrillas in their attempt to topple Colombia's government, earning the island until 2015 a spot on the US State Department's list of countries that support terrorism.Opinion: Why to some, Fidel Castro embodied hopeBut for the last four years Cuba hosted Colombian peace talks that in November led to a deal between Colombia's government and guerrillas, a big turnaround from the early years, when an isolated Fidel Castro tried to spread his revolution to other countries at the point of a gun.For decades Cuba was a beacon for would-be revolutionaries and even provided military training to dozens of radical groups, who are sending representatives to pay their respects to the fallen  Castro.CNN's Nic Robertson caught up with Gerry Adams, the former leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, as he stood in the massive line of people in Havana's Revolution Square.\"I'm here because Fidel was a good friend to Ireland,\" Adams said.Castro was also \"a good friend\" to revolutions across Africa. On Tuesday, Zimbabwe's ailing President Robert Mugabe arrived to attend the memorial to Castro.\"Fidel wasn't just your leader, Fidel was the leader of all revolutionaries,\" Mugabe told Cuban state TV upon arriving at Havana's Jose Martí Airport.But leaders of the United States and Russia, the two countries that most defined Cuba's international relations, will be conspicuously absent during the memorials.Despite having made history by restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and carrying out the first visit to Cuba since the revolution by a US president, Barack Obama will skip Castro's funeral.What's next for Cuba under Raul Castro?Obama did not meet with Castro during his landmark trip and the former Cuban leader later attacked him for his Cuba policy.The US Embassy in Havana is one of the few diplomatic missions in the Cuban capital that has not lowered its flag to half-staff to mark Castro's death.President-elect Trump has slammed Obama's policy and promised a tougher line on Cuba.\"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal,\" Trump tweeted on Sunday.While Russia is sending a delegation to Cuba, Vladimir Putin, who met with Castro during his last visit to Cuba in 2015 and promised closer relations with the former USSR's close ally, is not scheduled to travel to the island.There has been no explanation for Putin's absence, but it may well be that the Russian President is prioritizing the possibility of better relations with the incoming Trump administration over Russia's past ties with an old comrade.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/americas/cuba-fidel-castro-funeral-guests/index.html"}
{"_id":"What Trudeau's Castro comments reveal","articleText":"Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently \"Stokely: A Life.\" The views expressed here are his. (CNN)The firestorm over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's praise for Fidel Castro is proof that, despite the US government's official denunciation of the Cuban leader, Castro's legacy around the world ultimately remains far more complicated.Trudeau's characterization of Castro as a \"legendary revolutionary and orator\" drew swift and withering rebukes from American elected officials, most notably from Sen. Marco Rubio, who tweeted that Trudeau's remarks are \"shameful & embarrassing,\" and Sen. Ted Cruz, who called them \"disgraceful.\" Both senators are descendants of Cubans who fled pre- and post-revolutionary Cuba and both remain determined to close off US-Cuban ties until the island's communist regime is replaced with free elections.Castro's death, taking place against the backdrop of President Obama's efforts at the end of his tenure to normalize relations with Cuba, has touched off a fierce international debate over the meaning of human rights, social justice and political revolution.Trudeau's praise illuminates the fact that the meaning of Castro's legacy largely depends on historical context. He stands alongside Dr. Martin Luther King and Malcolm X as a political icon who indelibly shaped world history and re-shaped global politics before reaching the age of 40. Castro's successful 1959 revolution overthrew the US-backed Batista regime in favor of a socialist political experiment that was soon backed by the Soviet Union. Castro's acumen as a revolutionary reached far beyond his country's borders. He excoriated American imperialism in jaw-dropping three-hour speeches before the United Nations, met with Malcolm X and stayed in Harlem during a September 1960 visit to the States. He offered military, financial and medical assistance to unfolding liberation movements in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.Trudeau calls Castro a \"remarkable leader.\" As the leader of a tiny island 90 miles off the coast of Florida determined to reject the dictates of US foreign policy, Castro was nothing if not a survivor: He weathered assassination attempts, fallout from the Cuban missile crisis and the economic punishment of the US embargo to emerge as the symbolic leader of revolutionary movements raging across the Third World during the 1960s and 1970s. For liberation movements—including Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in South Africa—Cuba proved itself to be, under Castro's leadership, a friend of last resort, willing to stand by jailed and demonized guerrilla fighters who, over time, emerged as global statesmen. Cuba provided safe space for Black Panthers, political exiles and revolutionaries around the world challenging what Castro blasted as American imperialism.Castro's swashbuckling forays into international affairs also overshadowed a visible dark side: the ruthless suppression of anti-Castro opposition forces, the curtailment of freedom of speech and expression, the imprisonment and killing of political enemies and a failure to confront racial hierarchies in revolutionary Cuba.For all the genuine strides his regime made in offering free education, medical care, housing and resources for the Cuban people, Castro's authoritarian rule atrophied a once-promising revolution into a virtual dictatorship.Castro's most enduring legacy is a contradictory one. For millions around the world, he remains a defiant figure: the handsome, cigar-chomping leader who attended UN meetings in olive fatigues, comfortably gossiped with Cuban peasants without security guards and challenged the hypocrisies of American politicians who balked at his close ties to the Soviet Union and nationalization of Western industries on the island but were willing to support pro-capitalist dictators. For his critics, especially the large Cuban-American exile community in Florida, Castro remains in death an egomaniacal dictator who murdered friends, families and innocents and forced them into over a half-century-long exile they pray will end soon. Trudeau's expression of \"deep sorrow\" for Castro's death takes us back to an almost-vanished historical era, one in which public admission of complexity was not forbidden, statesmen did not use Twitter to make rash declarations and where even political enemies were offered a measure of dignity and respect in death.  Trudeau's words acknowledge the achievements of a towering, but flawed, political figure.  A warts-and-all portrait of Castro will satisfy neither unblinking supporters nor inveterate critics. Neither the saint nor the monster he's been often characterized as being, Castro was something far more and far less: a lawyer turned guerrilla leader who, in an extraordinary historical moment, threatened the legitimacy of the world's greatest superpower. He did it with a charismatic panache that dazzled millions and inaugurated political regimes that, like his own in Cuba, simultaneously furthered human rights and denied these same rights to internal critics.Trudeau's remembrance of Castro reminds us that the Cuban leader's final legacy has yet to be written, but will be as interesting, complex and messy in death as it was in the course of his lifetime.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/opinions/trudeau-castro-complicated-legacy-joseph-opinion/index.html"}
{"_id":"What Trump can learn from Michael Bloomberg on conflicts of interest","articleText":"Errol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Don't expect much clarity or relief from Donald Trump's scheduled announcement of how he intends to wall off his business interests from his work as President. All signs -- and a recent precedent involving another New York billionaire politician -- suggest that conflicts of interest will remain big, ugly, glaring, unavoidable and largely unresolved.With weeks to go until Inauguration Day, journalists have already cataloged a wide range of situations in which Trump's business interests clash with his job in the White House. His organization owns a hotel in Washington that is currently trying to renegotiate its lease from the federal government -- the same government Trump will be leading. Trump runs a tower on Wall Street whose tenants include a large number of people being regulated, investigated and/or prosecuted by federal agencies, all of which ultimately answer to the White House.He also has business deals with banks and businesses in India, Scotland, China, Germany and other countries -- and the full extent of the next president's debts, partnerships and ownership interests isn't even known, thanks to Trump's refusal to release his tax records. Trump's obfuscation of his business interests stands in stark contrast to the experience New Yorkers had with ex-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who ran three times for mayor and confronted many of the same issues now being raised with Trump.Bloomberg was more open than Trump, and at least gave lip service to the idea of preventing conflicts -- but even so the effort was only partly successful.Most of Bloomberg's fortune, estimated at $4 billion when he first ran for office in 2001 -- came from a 72% ownership stake in the financial information firm he started, Bloomberg L.P. After the surprise victory by Bloomberg, a serious concern about possible conflicts of interest came to light: His main business, providing data terminals and financial information to Wall Street firms, put him in a financial relationship with major New York companies -- including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs -- that were also lobbying the city government for contracts, tax abatements and other favors. Despite some noises about possibly placing his company and other assets into a blind trust, Bloomberg never fully relinquished control of the firm. He eventually placed much of his investments in the hands of a politically active financial manager, Steven Rattner, but did not agree to remain completely in the dark about how Rattner invested his money. The limits of Bloomberg's involvement were allegedly spelled out by an advisory opinion from the city's Conflicts of Interest Board, a remarkably weak board with no enforcement power whose members are all appointed by the mayor. Bloomberg later secured an updated advisory opinion from the board that allowed his money to be invested in a hedge fund and other riskier businesses.In the end, as ace investigative reporter Wayne Barrett discovered, Bloomberg greatly blurred the lines between his personal business and the city's. His personal assistants were simultaneously on the payrolls of the city, and a deputy mayor, Dan Doctoroff, ended up running Bloomberg L.P. after leaving government service, one of many city employees to cruise through a revolving door between the mayor's public and private roles.Most importantly, many Bloomberg clients -- including Merrill Lynch, which owned a major stake in Bloomberg L.P. --  were never barred from lobbying the city government: Barrett reported that at least 33 Bloomberg clients' firms were listed as doing business with the city while he was mayor.Bloomberg's three terms were relatively scandal-free, and none of the problems that did crop up involved the mayor's company. But there are few, if any, billionaires whose wealth isn't tied to or influenced by government in some way, making Trump's path to avoiding conflicts and scandal even tougher than Bloomberg's.

{"_id":"What a real 'Fault in our Stars' couple taught us about love and medicine","articleText":" (CNN)They became known as \"the real 'Fault in Our Stars' couple\" and soon became nearly as famous as the couple in the novel and movie.Katie Donovan and Dalton Prager -- like Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, the teenagers in the 2014 film -- fell in love even though they knew the other could die at any time.The real-life couple also shared a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Adding to their drama was the fact that Katie's doctors had directed her not to meet up with Dalton, because he had a highly contagious infection, and if she caught it, her life could be drastically shortened.She defied her doctors and went on a date with Dalton, and two years later, they married when they were both 20.Katie did catch Dalton's infection. She died September 22. Dalton died on September 17.Their love story captivated readers.A real 'Fault in Our Stars' coupleBut their story was more than just a touching and tragic tale that went viral on the Internet. Katie and Dalton's story teaches us lessons about love and medicine.You get to make a choice that might hasten your deathFor the most part, online bystanders were supportive of Katie and Dalton, wishing them well and praying for them after they died. But there were also haters, because of Katie's choice to meet up with Dalton even though he had that infection.The average life expectancy for a cystic fibrosis patient who reaches adulthood is 37, according to the National Library of Medicine. Katie died at 26. \"There's bullies behind names on the Internet that are like, 'You're so stupid,' \" she said.Less than a week before she died, Katie sat down for an interview with CNN at her home in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, and said she never regretted meeting up with Dalton.\"I'd rather have five years of being in love and just really completely happy than 20 years of not having anybody and just having nothing,\" she said.Dr. Chris Feudtner, an ethicist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the haters are wrong, and Katie had the right to make a decision that would probably shorten her life.\"We honor people's ability to make decisions for themselves,\" he said.He mentioned that his elderly mother, for example, wants to stay alone in her home instead of moving into assisted living, even though living at home increases the chances she could fall and no one would be immediately available to help her. He said his family is still working it out, but his mother might get her wish.\"We let people make decisions about how they want to live even in the face of pretty substantial risk,\" he said.Medicaid sometimes fails the very sickCNN first brought Katie and Dalton's story to light in April 2015 because she was having trouble getting a lung transplant.Doctors in her home state of Kentucky were reluctant to give her the transplant. They wanted her to go to a larger program at the University of Pittsburgh that had more experience performing transplants for people with infections.Kentucky Medicaid had refused to pay for her to have a lung transplant in another state. It agreed after CNN published its story.Dr. Pam Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, said Medicaid, which operates independently in each state, often won't pay for care in another state, even when it's clear the patient would be much better off.\"Unfortunately, this is quite common,\" said Shaw, a member of the board of the directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\"Our hospital is 1,000 feet from the Missouri state line, and we won't accept Missouri Medicaid, even though for some medical problems, we have the best services for children,\" she said. \"It just breaks my heart to tell a family 'I can't take care of you because you live in Missouri.' \"Shaw suggested that the government change Medicaid so it's more like Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly that's run by the federal government, not state governments.\"I know that's pie in the sky, but it would be a lot better for patients, their families and the physicians who care for them,\" she said.It's a real phenomenon: Spouses often die close togetherKatie and Dalton died just five days apart, and several studies show this isn't unusual. Researchers call it \"the widowhood effect.\"Studies have found that an elderly person's chance of dying increases by as much as 90% in the three months after his or her spouse dies, according to a 2008 study by researchers at Harvard and the University of Wisconsin.The physiological reason for this -- what actually is happening inside someone's body -- is pretty much a mystery.\"Broken heart syndrome,\" technically called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is one explanation. It's the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by the loss of a loved one, a divorce, a betrayal or any similar traumatic event. But not all spouses die of this particular problem. The 2008 study found that after losing a spouse, people die within just a few months of all sorts of diseases, including diabetes, infections and cancer.Part of it might be practical, said Dr. Eric DeJonge, director of Total Elder Care at Medstar Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital.\"Elderly couples often become 'co-dependent' on each other for cognitive or physical daily functions,\" he wrote in an email. \"When that support gets knocked out, it can destabilize the survivor.\"Dr. Christine Todd, an assistant professor of internal medicine and chairwoman of the department of medical humanities at Southern Illinois University, said she thinks it also has to do with the effect that emotions have on the immune system, especially on someone who's already in fragile health.\"Grief plus depression has a very dynamic effect,\" she said. \"Stress hormones and depression affect all your organs; it's enough to shut things down.\"The tragic end of the Pragers' love story touched millions around the world.Dalton was doing relatively well after his transplant in November 2014. But just as Katie's health was declining this fall, he caught pneumonia.Still, his family hoped he'd beat the infection and get out of the hospital in time to visit Katie at home before she died.Family members never expected he would die before her, and when he did, Katie was \"devasted,\" said her mother, Debra Donovan.\"She's just in shock,\" Donovan said the day Dalton died. \"And she hasn't felt well today.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/health/lasting-lessons-from-a-real-fault-in-our-stars-couple/index.html"}

KashmirThousands of people in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir have been forced to flee their homes in recent weeks amid increasing violence along the border with India.India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir for almost seven decades, but tensions have reached a boiling point this year, after armed militants attacked an Indian army base and two Pakistani soldiers were killed in clashes with Indian troops. Last week, cross-border shelling hit a passenger bus and killed at least nine people in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, in what Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif described as \"naked aggression.\" Rhetoric on both sides of the border has sparked concern that the two countries could go to war. Tensions with India are a \"major challenge that the military and country faces,\" retired Lt. Gen. Talat Masood told CNN. Nevertheless, Bajwa's appointment provides Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi an opportunity to \"recalibrate and reset (India's) policy towards Kashmir and Pakistan,\" Masood said. Rifaat Hussain, a professor of public policy at Pakistan's National University of Science and Technology, said Bajra has \"extensive experience of handling Kashmir.\" \"He comes to this job battle hardened, well-versed with Kashmir,\" he said. \"That is going to be the main focus.\" TerrorismDespite the increased tensions with India, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that Bajwa \"is said to consider extremism a bigger threat for the country.\" The country has suffered a number of major terrorist attacks this year, including a bombing in Lahore over Easter that left more than 70 people dead and hundreds injured. That attack was carried out by a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, which itself has been responsible for a number of horrific attacks. \"Although the situation has improved in relative terms ... the fight is not over,\" Masood said. \"This needs serious attention.\" Ensuring that \"violent and extremist forces in the country are marginalized\" will be a major challenge facing Bajwa, according to Hussain. CPECRelated to the terrorism issue is the matter of security for projects related to the China-Pakistan economic corridor, or CPEC, a key development project worth billions to Pakistan. Projects in southwestern Balochistan province have been targeted by terrorists. Last month, suicide bombers killed more than 60 people and injured 110 more.\"The army is very clear in its aim to go out of its way to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and quash any rebel and militant attacks,\" said Hussain. \"The military is a vital stakeholder in the implementation of CPEC.\" Islamabad In a country that has experienced three coups and spent decades under military rule, the relationship between the army and the government will always be a slightly tense one. Current Prime Minister Sharif was himself ousted in a coup in 1999 during his second stint in power. He was re-elected in 2013. \"Bajwa is likely to give more space to the civilian (government) than his predecessor,\" Masood said. \"He realizes that it is important for Pakistan's civilian government to assert itself on an international scale for the good of the country as a whole.\" Hussain pointed out that Sharif has found himself in the unique position of choosing five of the country's top military commanders, including Pervez Musharraf, the general who led the 1999 coup.TrumpOne major factor Bajwa will have to deal with that his predecessor did not, is Donald Trump. The US President-elect has said his administration will be \"best friends\" with India, a remark that sparked slight consternation in Pakistan, though a key adviser to Sharif said Islamabad was unconcerned. Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn is another matter. He has previously called for the US to overthrow regimes that are \"Islamic republics,\" which could be taken to include Pakistan. \"Pakistan-American military relations to a great extent will depend on the situation in Afghanistan,\" military analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said. Trump has cited Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as a reason to keep US troops in Afghanistan. But analysts said that if US-Pakistan relations are to stay strong, counter-terror efforts inside Pakistan will have to increase.\"The American government complains that Pakistan is not dealing with militant groups within its borders,\" said Rizvi. Such groups \"have been a bone of contention for relations between Pakistan and the United States,\" Masood said. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, Pakistan, and James Griffiths reported from Hong Kong.

{"_id":"What could happen to birth control under President Trump?","articleText":" (CNN)Some women are on the hunt for reversible birth control that could last through a Donald Trump presidency.Tweets and Facebook posts about getting intrauterine devices, or IUDs, swept social media Wednesday as women warned each other that their access to birth control might dwindle once the President-elect takes office next year. Throughout his campaign, Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which mandates that insurers in the health insurance marketplace provide coverage for all FDA-approved birth control methods, including IUDs, with no copayment or coinsurance when provided in-network. Repealing the act is also a \"high item on the list\" for Trump's Republican colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. However, for now, enrollment will still be available through January 31.Neither Trump nor Congress has revealed a detailed plan of what would replace the ACA, so no one knows exactly what would happen to birth control access.In September, Trump said that he actually is not in favor of requiring a prescription to purchase birth control. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists expressed a similar position in 2012 when it indicated in a \"committee opinion\" that oral contraceptives should be available over the counter. The opinion was reaffirmed this year.However, growing concern that access will be thrown out under a Trump administration has changed the conversations that Dr. Anne Davis, an OB/GYN in New York, has with her patients -- and the questions that they bring to her. Shaken with worry, many women have had tears in their eyes this week as they waited in her office, said Davis, who also serves as consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health, a nonprofit that says it works to improve access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion.\"Between last week and this week, my talking with patients has completely changed,\" Davis said. \"Last week, it was all about, 'Let's talk about what's best for you,' and it was all about the patient. This week, politics is in the chair next to me.\"Davis said she overheard her medical secretaries responding to an influx of IUD-related questions from patients on the phone Wednesday.\"They said, 'That's the third one we've had this morning who called saying \"I need to get my IUD as soon as possible, because I'm really worried I'm going to lose my coverage,\" ' \" Davis said.An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic device that is inserted in the uterus by a doctor to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The device can be easily removed by a doctor.Three types of IUDs are available in the United States: ParaGard, Mirena and Skyla. Once in place, ParaGard IUDs are effective for 10 years or more; Mirena can last for at least five years and Skyla for three years.\"Since the election, we have seen an uptick in questions about access to health care, birth control, and the Affordable Care Act. While we truly hope that birth control methods will be available, accessible, and affordable to all women under the Trump administration, we understand people's real concerns about losing access to birth control, which is basic health care for women,\" said Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a written statement to CNN.\"We have seen an increase in IUDs over the last few years thanks to the Affordable Care Act and growing public awareness of their safety and efficacy, and we expect that trend to continue. Planned Parenthood health centers nationally have seen the total number of patients using IUDs increase 91% over the last five years,\" the statement said.Virtually all sexually active women of reproductive age -- about 99% -- have used at least one contraceptive method in their lifetimes from 2006 to 2010, according to a 2013 National Health Statistics Report from the Department of Health and Human Services (PDF).About 7% of sexually active women use IUDs, according to a 2015 data brief from the National Center for Health Statistics (PDF).As women wait to see what will happen in the future of their birth control options, what advice does Davis have?\"You have to talk to somebody to figure out what's the best birth control plan for you based on your circumstances, and if you want to get a method that is long-lasting, like IUDs, those do have a big upfront cost, so get it while it's covered,\" she said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/health/birth-control-trump/index.html"}
{"_id":"What does an insular US mean for the rest of the world?","articleText":"William C. Wohlforth is the Daniel Webster Professor at the Department of Government, Dartmouth College. Stephen Brooks is associate professor of government at Dartmouth College. The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the authors.  (CNN)How would the United States fare without its globe-girdling array of military alliances? For the first time in memory, this is no longer an academic question.  President-elect Donald Trump has questioned why the United States invests so much in these security partnerships when it seemingly receives so little in return. By either abandoning or neglecting commitments, or seeking to shake down allies for better deals, a Trump administration might lead us to a world without robust US security alliances -- the very foundation of the \"globalist\" American posture many Trump supporters disparage. And that would be an extremely high-risk gamble.  Our recent book, \"America Abroad,\" examines what a world without US alliances would look like; we conclude that a large-scale pullback would serve America's interests only if four assumptions are true.More nuclear statesFirst, you have to believe that the spread of nuclear weapons will occur in a responsible way, with all the new nuclear weapons states building up the kinds of survivable forces that have little risk of accidents and miscalculations.  Make no mistake -- there will be many new nuclear states. Trump has mused that it might actually be good if allies currently under the US security umbrella were to seek nuclear deterrents. But proliferation would not stop there: Alarmed neighbors would almost certainly follow suit.Could we count on new nuclear powers to secure their forces, to make sure they do not get into the wrong hands and are subject to reliable control in a crisis? Reams of scholarship says no. To take one example: Pakistan has built what scholars say is a highly unstable hair-trigger nuclear arsenal, and is mainly responsible for proliferating nuclear capability to North Korea.  A world without US security guarantees risks more such states, with the attendant risks of nuclear war and leakage to hostile nonstate actors.Arms races and risk of warSecond, you have to believe that decreased security abroad will not make the United States less secure. Removing US security guarantees clearly makes allies less secure, and that fear will drive arms races and risk war. Just think about what happens if we were to stop underwriting Japan's security -- given the historical animosities involved, what happens when Japan responds on its own to China's growing military power, how do Beijing and other regional powers react, and so on? Regions engulfed in rivalry, arms racing, crises and possibly armed conflict would escalate the challenges of dealing with the security problems of today while also generating new ones.Think addressing threats such as ISIS and al Qaeda is hard now? Try dealing with those issues if Europe and Asia were also destabilized and themselves generating different and possibly even more challenging threats.War costs everyoneThird, you have to believe that instability and war abroad will not affect prosperity at home. There is little doubt that war and instability \"over there\" would affect prosperity here. To believe otherwise, you have to believe that US firms and investors can somehow avoid being harmed by the turbulence in the markets that would inevitably follow conflicts overseas.  Academic studies debunk that belief for what it is: a relic of your grandfather's world economy (back when financial markets were not tied together in an elaborate web and when vast swaths of American firms were not highly reliant on overseas plants, research facilities and suppliers as they are now).Alliances take hard work; why put that to waste?Fourth, you have to believe that the United States can create coalitions on an ad hoc, as-needed basis. But alliances of the kind the United States now possesses can't just be assembled the moment Washington faces a crisis and wants help from other states.US alliances are deeply institutionalized relationships, reflecting complicated bargains that cannot be reduced to a zero-sum \"who gets what?\" real estate transaction. Their construction in the early Cold War took immense efforts, and conditions were uniquely favorable: The United States produced some 40% of global output, Europe and Asia lay wrecked from the world war, and America and its partners faced the overpowering need to contain the threat of Soviet power.Consider, also, how few and unreliable Russia's and China's long-term allies are. Moscow can often depend on Belarus and it may have a loyal partner in Bashar al-Assad's Damascus. For its part, China has North Korea. Would they like to have more? Sure, but building up alliances is hard to do -- something to ponder before putting current US alliances on the chopping block.To think that pulling back will go well for America requires confidence that many other important things would work out right: that global oil prices will always quickly stabilize if a conflict emerges in major oil-producing region; that maintaining the openness of the sea lanes will not be made more difficult and perilous; that abandoning alliances with the world's leading economies will not sap the US ability to prevent the global economic order it constructed after World War II from being changed in ways damaging to America's interests; that inter-state cooperation on all sorts of other issues, from terrorism to global crime to the environment, will work just as well without the leverage the United States gains from its alliances.  Having reviewed the relevant scholarship, it's hard to find any basis for optimism on how these issues would pan out.        There are good reasons most national security experts condemned loose talk about US alliances being \"obsolete\": The world that would emerge in their absence would be much more dangerous.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)During his meeting with The New York Times, President-elect Donald Trump sent shivers down the spines of many observers when he announced that, \"The law's totally on my side, the President can't have a conflict of interest.\" The comment instantly recalled the infamous remark that former President Richard Nixon made to David Frost in 1977, three years after Nixon resigned in the midst of a scandal. \"When the President does it, that means it is not illegal,\" he told Frost. Trump's early attitude about the prestigious office he will hold brings back unsettling memories of Nixon, who didn't see the boundaries of the institution he governed.Indeed, the first weeks since the election have raised all sorts of concerns. While Trump spent much of his campaign blasting the Clinton Foundation as some big pay-to-play scheme, Trump has been defiant in his insistence that he has the right to let his children run his international business and that he has no plan to create any kind of serious firewall.

{"_id":"What happens to Raqqa after ISIS is defeated?","articleText":"Marwan Hisham is a Syrian journalist who reported from the city of Raqqa until January 2016. He now lives in Istanbul and writes for a number of international publications. (CNN)Three weeks ago, the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced the beginning of the long-anticipated offensive to take over ISIS' de facto capital, Raqqa. Since then, the coalition of Kurdish and Arab militias -- spearheaded by the YPG Kurdish militant group -- has achieved a slow but steady advance, capturing villages as close as 19 miles from the city.The people of Raqqa, who've been living under the brutal rule of ISIS for over two years now, know that they want the militants out of their city. But what the predominantly Sunni Arab population is not sure of is whether they want the Kurds and other militias anywhere close.When I was in Raqqa last January, people were gossiping about a possible offensive involving the Kurds. Ali al-Jasem (not his real name), a friend of mine and a former ISIS prison detainee -- guilty of using his cellphone to film the aftermath of an attack -- was thrilled at the possibility of the coalition taking over the city from ISIS. He believed ISIS' days were numbered. In July 2015, the Kurdish forces liberated his hometown, Serrin, a village near Tishreen dam. \"They treated people just fine, believe me,\" he told me. \"They only went after suspected Daesh members.\"But as with most Syrians, the residents of Raqqa are polarized over many issues, including the Kurdish-led coalition. And as a proof of how dramatic the division could be, the very same coalition al-Jasem supports had killed his own cousin, who worked as a photographer on the front lines for the ISIS propaganda Amaq Agency. Al-Jasem felt no sorrow for his cousin's fate. He eventually snuck out of this crazy place at the first opportunity.With both the Mosul and Raqqa offensives underway, and as ISIS begins to shrink, all eyes are focused on the post-ISIS era. Both cities, like the rest of ISIS territory, are inhabited by a Sunni Arab majority, which is under-represented in the coalition forces and is often blamed for the atrocities committed by the jihadist group, who dubs itself as a champion of the Sunni cause. The fact that ISIS fighters tend to hide among civilians and use them as human shields makes it harder to distinguish between a fighter and a civilian.The liberation forces on the Raqqa front are predominantly Kurdish. On the Iraqi front, they are mainly Kurdish and Shia -- a fact that raises fears among the population of both cities of potential ethnic cleansing and sectarian retaliations following ISIS' ousting. The fleeing of some Iraqi civilians from Mosul all the way to Raqqa, crossing hundreds of miles, as opposed to staying in liberated areas in their home country, is only telling of the mistrust toward their liberators. It's worth mentioning that before ISIS came to being, Raqqa was home to thousands of Kurds who lived side by side with Arabs. War shattered that sense of community.Thus getting rid of ISIS without putting in place a viable governance alternative will only stir tensions. And renewed instability will only pave the way for the return of ISIS, a group that prospers in times of violence and chaos.While still in the early phases of the Mosul offensive, reports of war crimes began to emerge.  Earlier this month, Amnest International claimed that men wearing Iraqi police uniforms were committing acts of torture and unlawfully killing villagers \"in cold blood.\" The Iraqi federal police denied any involvement in unlawful killings.This was followed by a report last week in which Human Rights Watch accused Peshmerga forces of destroying Arab houses in an effort to claim the area as part of the Kurdish autonomous region. Kurdish officials issued a strong denial of these claims.The US and other entities supporting the coalition must put pressure on their allies on the ground to act responsibly in order to prevent such dangerous violations, which threaten to fuel a wider ethno-sectarian war. The brewing of this ethno-sectarian strife in the region is no secret to officials and policy makers. Ignoring it won't do any good. When locals celebrate the end of ISIS' brutal rule, they should be assured that they can finally live in peace.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/opinions/what-happens-to-raqqa-hisham-opinion/index.html"}
{"_id":"What happens when you normalize the abnormal","articleText":"Ethan Zuckerman is director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and co-founder of the international blogging network, Global Voices. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)The white nationalist leader Richard Spencer gave a speech Saturday night in Washington in which he invoked Nazi propaganda, questioned whether Jews were people and called America \"a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity.\" When he finished, the audience offered Nazi salutes and chanted, \"Hail Trump! Hail the people! Hail victory!\"Spencer and others in the white nationalist movement see the election of Donald Trump and his appointment of Breitbart News publisher Steve Bannon as his chief strategist as clear evidence that their views are entering the mainstream. The rebranding of \"neo-Nazis\" into the \"alt-right\" and the wave of media attention Spencer, Bannon and other extremists have received this year have lodged them firmly in the national debate.This is a good thing.Not because Spencer's blood-chilling racial hatred is good for political discourse in America -- it's not. But it's good news in the same way that Hillary Clinton's defeat in the Electoral College was good news for American progressives. Had a few thousand voters in swing states stayed home, we would be celebrating the first female Commander in Chief and laughing about what a strange year 2016 was. Instead, we're confronting the deep currents of racism, sexism, Islamophobia and xenophobia that infect American society. These currents have never been far below the surface in American political life, but have now come out to party. Had Clinton won, most of us still wouldn't know who Richard Spencer is.In the race to assign blame for Clinton's defeat and the media's failure to see it coming, pundits have proposed a host of possible causes: the Electoral College, voter suppression, unenthusiastic black voters, secret Trump supporters, third-party candidates, sophisticated ad targeting, fake news and the echo chamber of social media. In 2013, I published a book that argued that while the Internet made it possible for us to hear opinions and perspectives from all over the world, the vast majority of us go online to learn about topics we're already interested in and to reinforce our existing biases and positions. Unlike my friend Eli Pariser, who places blame on unaccountable algorithms for \"filter bubbles,\" I see these echo chambers as the result of the basic human drive toward homophily, the tendency of birds of a feather to flock together. The Internet has allowed very different flocks to form than in analog days. In the days of three television networks, a relatively narrow range of political views were discussed in public fora. Journalist Daniel Hallin referred to three spheres of media discourse: consensus, legitimate controversy, and deviance.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/opinions/bannon-spencer-white-supremacy-trump-zuckerman/index.html"}
{"_id":"What is cryogenic preservation?","articleText":" (CNN)Cryopreservation is the process by which any living cells, tissues, organs or entire bodies are protected from decay by storing them at extremely low temperatures.The idea is to preserve them for indefinite periods until the rest of science has caught up and technology is available to revive them, bring them back to life and maybe cure the condition that killed them in the first place. Such technology, however, does not yet exist.According to the Cryonics Institute, an US organization that offers the service, the fundamental goal is \"to give people a second chance at life\" and extend human lifespans.But scientists who work with cryopreservation on smaller scales for research purposes are skeptical. \"It is currently science fiction to suggest that a person could be brought back to life in the future even considering technological advances,\" Dr. Channa Jayasena, clinical senior lecturer in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, said in a statement. \"Cryonics has risks for the patient, poses ethical issues for society, is highly expensive, but has no proven benefit. If this was a drug, it would never get approved.\"That said, how does the process work?How does cryopreservation work?The process involves three key steps once someone has been declared legally dead, according to the Cryonics Institute.First, the body is immediately placed in an ice bath. At the same time, a ventilation mask is used to continue providing oxygen to the body's organs -- particularly the brain -- and the anticoagulant heparin and automated CPR are used to maintain blood flow. Body temperature is monitored to ensure a gradual reduction. Next, the body is \"vitrified,\" meaning its cells and organs are prepared for the ultra-low temperatures they will soon experience. This involves replacing the body's fluids with injected cryoprotective agents that act as an antifreeze, protecting the body from the damage of becoming frozen.Now that the body is prepped for the cold, the process of controlled cooling begins. This is the final step before long-term storage and involves slowly cooling the body further. The body is placed inside a protective insulating bag and then inside a cooling box where liquid nitrogen is fed in at a steady rate. This takes place slowly, over several days, until the body reaches a temperature of minus-200 degrees Celsius.Those offering the service stress the slow and steady rate of the entire process, to ensure the least risk of damage to a person's body. Either before or after the second stage, bodies may be transported to the nearest storage facility to complete the process. Once ready for storage, the body is put inside a liquid nitrogen vessel known as a cryostat. The vessels are not powered by electricity, so they are not affected by power outages.What is neuropreservation?Another, sometimes cheaper, option is neuropreservation, in which only a person's head is preserved on the assumption that information within the brain is the most important for a person to live again and that a new body could be cloned or regenerated. Why do people want cryopreservation?Companies offer the option of cryopreservation on the belief that science, technology and medicine will someday be able to revive patients and even cure or treat the diseases that killed them in order to give them a new chance at life. The Cryonics Institute believes it is allowing people to \"buy time until technology catches up and is able to fully repair and restore the human body.\"Major League Baseball player Ted Williams, who died in 2002, underwent neuropreservation. His head is cryogenically frozen, awaiting the day it can be attached to a new body and revived. The first person to be cryopreserved was Dr. James Bedford, a psychology professor at the University of California, who was cryonically suspended in 1967 at the age of 73 through Arizona-based Alcor. The company's former vice president Jerry Leaf, who died in 1991, is also frozen.Although only a handful of people have been cryogenically preserved, many more have joined the list to be suspended in liquid nitrogen upon their death. The Cryonics Institute alone has more than 800 members in the United States and more than 100 more worldwide. How much does it cost?The process is expensive. Fees start at $28,000 and go up to $200,000, paid upon death by either the patient or their insurance policy. Companies often also require membership ahead of the procedure and may apply surcharges for people outside the country.Does it work?Cryonics UK, a nonprofit organization, says cryopreservation cannot be guaranteed to work and that it's up to people who want to try it. Barry Fuller, professor in surgical science and low-temperature medicine at University College London, highlighted the benefits the process has had on a smaller level for scientific research.\"Cryopreservation is a remarkable technology which allows us to store living cells, almost indefinitely, at ultra-low temperatures,\" he said. \"It has many useful applications in day-to-day medicine, such as cryopreserving blood cells, sperm and embryos.\"But he added that this has not been proven viable for entire bodies, though he hopes it can be proved step by step, starting with organs. \"Cryopreservation has not yet been successfully applied to large structures, such as human kidneys for transplantation, because we have not yet adequately been able to produce suitable equipment to optimise all the steps,\" he said. \"This is why we have to say that at the moment, we have no objective evidence that a whole human body can survive cryopreservation with cells which will function after rearming. ... At the moment, we cannot achieve that.\"Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College London, is even more skeptical. \"Despite the claims made by cryonics companies, they've failed to demonstrate that the extraordinary mass of tissue that constitutes the human brain can be protected by the antifreeze that they try to pump through the body after death,\" he said. \"This tissue may indeed be safe once it's in liquid nitrogen, but it will have already sustained incalculable and irreversible damage during the preparatory processes.\"Coen questions whether revival will become a reality. \"Advocates of cryonics are unable to cite any study in which a whole mammalian brain (let alone a whole mammalian body) has been resuscitated after storage in liquid nitrogen,\" he said. \"The companies selling the packages focus on safe storage of the tissue and openly admit that there's no current procedure for resuscitation -- but they gloss over all the damage that's caused while they're preparing the tissue for storage.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/health/how-cryopreservation-and-cryonics-works/index.html"}
{"_id":"What it means to be gender-fluid","articleText":" (CNN)For some people, gender is not just about being male or female; in fact, how one identifies can change every day or even every few hours.  Gender fluidity, when gender expression shifts between masculine and feminine, can be displayed in how we dress, express and describe ourselves. Everyone's gender exists on a spectrum, according to Dot Brauer, director of the LGBTQA Center at the University of Vermont. Progressive gender expression is the norm for the university, which offers gender-neutral bathrooms and allows students to use their preferred names. \"If you imagine the spectrum and imagine the most feminine expression you have ever seen and most masculine you have ever seen and just sort of imagine where you are on that,\" Brauer said.Brauer, who identifies as gender-queer and prefers the pronoun \"they,\" said gender identification is about what feels right for the person.Information is fluid\"In my generation, all the information that came to me was filtered through some very sort of limited perspectives and limiting languages. So for example, if I was going to find out about gender, I was going to find out about it through health class in a curriculum that was set by the Board of Education,\" Brauer said. Since millennials grew up with the Internet, members of that generation can easily find information on topics like gender expression, added Brauer, 58.Lee Luxion, who is 26 and also prefers the pronoun \"they,\" might wake up as a man or as a woman, sometimes as both and sometimes as neither.\"How I express it is usually how I dress, how I do my hair. But then my mannerisms change. The way I speak might change a little, too,\" Luxion said.Luxion agreed that the Internet, along with the emergence of gender-fluid celebrities such as \"Orange Is the New Black's\" Ruby Rose, has made millennials more comfortable with expressing their gender.  \"There shouldn't be a sense of what's normal and what is not,\" Luxion said. \"And (with) more representation of transgender or gender-fluid or non-binary individuals, the more likely it is that we are going to feel safe to also be that publicly.\"There are lots of misconceptions about gender fluidity, according to those in the community. Being gender-fluid doesn't determine a person's sexual preference. Gender fluidity isn't the equivalent of transgenderism, in which a person's gender identity is different from the one assigned at birth. Luxion balks at the idea that gender fluidity isn't a valid gender, a refrain they've heard time and again.\"Gender fluidity is much more than saying, 'oh, I want to play up the femininity traits that I have' or that 'I want to play up the masculine traits that I have.' It's an actual physical, mental and, for me, emotional shift in how I interact with the world.\"More than just appearanceTheresa \"TDo\" Do, a 37-year-old San Francisco native, was born and raised female but never felt that way. She appears androgynous with a short haircut and expresses her gender fluidity in how she behaves. In situations when Do feels challenged, she said, she feels more masculine and expresses herself in that way.\"The tone of my voice does change. It comes a little bit more forward. My voice drops a bit,\" she said. \"I have been told that I walk really masculine, and I puff my chest out when I'm walking.\"When she feels like she is in a safer place, she becomes more feminine.  \"My voice gets a little higher. I drop my shoulders. I allow people to just get closer to me emotionally and in a physical way,\" Do said. \"For me in particular, when I am in touch with my feminine side, I feel soft.\"Brauer said others' perceptions and an individual's interpretation of their own gender play a part in how gender is conveyed. \"There's this constant exchange going on. ... Identity is this weird thing that exists between us people. It's like this perception, thought space, between us and other people,\" they said.Thomas Webb, 33, identifies as gender-fluid and feels masculine \"two-thirds\" of the time. Webb's gender-fluid expression alternates from masculine to feminine with how they dress, from suits to skirts.\"When I was in high school, I don't remember words like that ever existing. I didn't learn about the word 'gender-queer' until my early 20s. I was using terms like 'cross-dresser' or 'transvestite' to describe myself, because that was all that I was aware of at the time,\" they said.Raising a gender-fluid childFranki Davis, 14, identifies as gender-fluid demiboy and uses the \"they\" pronoun. Demiboy means a person identifies partially as a man. Franki has bright green hair and an androgynous, neutral appearance. Like any teenager, they like to go to concerts, take pictures and Skype with friends.Franki discovered their gender identity during adolescence. And when they came out as demiboy, mom Kristen Shaw homeschooled Franki due to the anxiety they faced at school.\"My greatest concern was that they were going to be more isolated and the limited friendships they have socially,\" Shaw said.Shaw said she would tell a parent of a child like hers to understand that it's important to let them grow.\"Before our children were born, what was most important was that we proclaimed that all we wanted was a healthy baby. And if we are lucky enough to have that, then we just take it from there. It's a one day at a time process. Our job is to be their life cheerleader and set them up for success,\" she said.Opinion and intersectionalityBrauer writes in a paper titled \"Gender: It's Complicated\" that younger generations see identity through \"the lens of intersectionality,\" which includes age, sex, location, socioeconomic class and other factors.\"I might be perceived as someone who has a female sex to be pretty masculine by the gender standards of femininity that exists\" in the mid-Atlantic, Brauer said. \"But here, in Vermont, the standards for gender and femininity are different. So, right here I would be seen not overly masculine and not overly feminine.\"When Do is in the office, she said, she gets stares from clients when expressing her gender fluidity.\"In a business meeting, I might have to look a little bit harder to earn the respect of others,\" she said. And when she leaves the \"San Francisco bubble,\" she feels more tension. Webb, who lives in Southern California, said they haven't felt discriminated against because they stopped publicly wearing women's clothing and dressing androgynously. They said it was easier dressing as a man than a woman. \"People kind of confuse personality and gender. My personality isn't stereotypically feminine. So even when I'm wearing a skirt and everything, people just look at me as a dude in a skirt for better or worse. ... I don't think they treat me as they would a lot of the trans or other gender-fluid people who happen to act more feminine,\" Webb said.For Luxion, telling someone their gender identity can lead to hurtful responses.\"When I get negative responses or people telling me that my gender is invalid or wrong, it's frustrating and it's hurtful, but really it's making me sad that people still aren't willing to take a step back,\" Luxion said. \"It's not doing anyone harm. So I don't understand why they would be so opposed to it.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/04/13/living/gender-fluid-feat/index.html"}
{"_id":"What it's like to be gay and Muslim","articleText":" (CNN)Lia Darjes spent some time taking photos in the blissfully lilac bedroom of El-Farouk and his husband, Troy, in Toronto. The men, both Muslim, are naturally lit in a peaceful aura of domesticity, sunken into a comfortable bed with their black cat. But as with many gay Muslims she interviewed and photographed, unsettling inner dialogues are taking place beneath the surface. \"I could tell you where I am now and it would sound rather a happy place,\" El-Farouk told Darjes. \"But the journey to that place has not been an easy one.\" He told the photographer that many people like him have suffered \"spiritual violence, where you are being told that there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with you.\"As a result, a lot of queer people end up leaving religion or stepping out of religion or having a very unhealthy relationship with religion.\"Over time, El-Farouk has managed to reconcile his spirituality with his sexuality.\"I started with the notion that it was sinful (to be gay) and that those who practiced it were problematic at best,\" he said. \"But that didn't quite sort of seem right in the larger construct of the Quran and the Prophet that I believed to be true. ... In verse 49.13, Allah says, 'I created you to different nations and tribes and you may know and learn from each other.' I just see queer folk as one of those nations or tribes.\"Darjes wanted to learn more about gay Muslims and their personal struggles. So she visited several cities in Europe and North America, hoping to gain people's confidence for her photo project \"Being Queer. Feeling Muslim.\" It wasn't easy.\"You are asking about their religion and their sexuality, the most two private things for most people. You really have to convince them,\" she said. \"I am not gay and I am not Muslim, and I come as an outsider.\"In Paris, Darjes spent time with Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed, an openly gay imam who opened the city's first gay-friendly mosque.\"The reactions were quite vehement,\" he told her. \"Being Muslim, Arabic and gay and thus a member of several minority groups opened my eyes: Minorities are being discriminated against, particularly in times of economic crisis. We have to know more about Islam, and we have to understand who we actually are in order to fight homophobia.\"Darjes attended prayer sessions at the mosque, which is perched in a Muslim neighborhood.\"I just sat there in a corner during the sessions when I met this woman who was, for the first time since coming out, able to attend prayer without feeling guilty,\" Darjes said. The woman was also \"feeling relieved to be in a community again.\"The United States proved to be Darjes' first major challenge, the photographer said.\"There were no events, and people were being extremely private,\" she said. That was until she met openly gay imam Daayiee Abdullah, a former Southern Baptist turned Muslim who studied the Quran in Beijing and opened a gay mosque in Washington.\"As an inclusive imam who is also gay,\" Abdullah told Darjes, \"I understand the turmoil of homosexual Muslims. When I converted to Islam 34 years ago, I wasn't speaking Arabic yet. I was studying at Beijing University, and the first Quran I read was in Mandarin. That was a blessing for me. To get to know Islam in the Near East and the West, living there to continue forming my understanding that Islam is not monolithic, was necessary. \"It is not only a religion or belief; it is also a formulation that depends upon the culture it enters. Allah demonstrates there is a great diversity already in creation. The question is: Do we respect that?\"Interpretations abound in the constant debate on whether it is acceptable to be gay in the Islamic faith. Some Muslim-majority nations are more tolerant toward the issue and accepting of the LGBT community. But there are also countries where homosexuality may be a capital crime. \"I am from a country where it is punishable by death to be gay,\" said Samira, one of Darjes' subjects who was born in Iran. \"In 1979, when the Islamic Revolution began, my family immigrated to Canada, where I grew up pretty secular.\"Darjes said the LGBT communities she worked with were \"very positive\" and more defiant than ever. Her resulting photographs, naturally lit, often carry discreet hues of blue, a spiritual color that also creates an atmosphere of serenity in the individuals portrayed.\"I rarely got the feeling I was going to work with traumatized people,\" she said. \"You had a feeling they had arrived at something, that they had found something good in these associations and meetings.\"Lia Darjes is a photographer who lives and works in Germany.

{"_id":"What it's like to fly on Air Force One","articleText":"Washington (CNN)Few Americans -- including Donald Trump, at least for now -- have flown aboard Air Force One.The plane is the preserve of Presidents, their families, staffers, Secret Service agents, servicemen -- and journalists, who accompany the commander-in-chief from a cabin at the very back of his plane.Together, we've flown on Air Force one with three presidents to nearly all fifty states and dozens of countries. CNN journalists have been accompanying Presidents in the air since Ronald Reagan was in office.It's an experience that somehow blends the ease of private travel with the rigor of the US military and throws in some of the hassles of flying commercially.It's regularly awe-inducing. It's sometimes exhausting. It's always an honor.Air Force One may be the world's most supercharged Boeing, but a ride aboard the presidential aircraft doesn't reveal the plane's hidden layers.There's never been a time, for example, when the plane had to withstand a nuclear attack (you probably would have heard about that). And the plane's ability to refuel mid-flight is reserved only for disaster scenarios. And unlike the President, the press traveling aboard don't make use of its secure communication gear.Indeed, the plane conceals in its hidden defenses, leaving even those traveling in its rear press cabin wondering what might be stored in the vast body of the aircraft. Rumors abound: Is there really an escape pod, like the one Harrison Ford tried to use in \"Air Force One?\" (Officially, no). What types of measures are in place to counter an anti-aircraft missile? (A lot, but details are classified).To the naked eye, flying on Air Force One bears some similarities to a commercial flight. If you're flying the plane from its home at Joint Base Andrews, you still pass through security on your way to the terminal. The seats, at least for those in the back, are comfortable but nothing like the lie-flat pods in business class cabins on major carriers. And the plane still lacks enough overhead space, particularly when flying for a week-long overseas swing.But in a larger way, flying on Air Force One is nothing like a routine commercial journey. The plane reveals a sense of imposing power to anyone who's aboard.Everything from the coffee cups to the mini Tabasco bottles to the tube of mouthwash in the bathroom are labeled with the Presidential seal -- a constant reminder of the most important passenger aboard. On long-haul flights, sleep is difficult knowing there's a (rare) chance the President could pop his head into the press cabin.Unlike commercial aircraft half their age, the two modified Boeing 747s are in impeccable condition thanks to dedicated US Air Force staff who maintain them. So, too, do the staff prepare food for even the shortest flights (a 20-minute flight from Philadelphia to Washington last month included little boxes of celery sticks).There's never any nagging from the flight staff about buckling seat belts or squeezing your belongings under the seat. There's no waiting around; as soon as the President boards, the plane begins taxiing for takeoff. It regularly flies directly through turbulence, leading to bumpier flights than on a commercial journey.For the press, a phone is always available to call down to the ground, though using it is somewhat complicated. The President's staff finally has wifi onboard to communicate with their colleagues on the ground, though journalists remain (sometimes happily) disconnected while the plane is in flight.The gleaming blue-and-while fuselage remains an enduring symbol of American authority, half-a-century after Jackie Kennedy hired a professional designer to concoct an airborne visual identity for her husband and the presidency.It's that symbol which has traveled to nearly every continent, landing in places as diverse as Midway Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to foreign capitals, where the image of the plane landing can bear historic significance.There are few other planes that could fly to such diverse locations. What other plane carrying a full-sized bed, a bathroom with a shower, a presidential desk, and a mini operating suite could land, for example, at the far-flung Al-Asad Airbase in Afghanistan's Anbar province? The TV producer on board even brought along a satellite dish to transmit President George W. Bush's remarks live.On 9/11, the plane became a mobile command center as Bush darted from state to state, officials never revealing ahead of time where he was headed. Every other plane in the country was grounded.During Obama's tenure, the plane has carried the President to places where the site of the blue-and-white aircraft would have been unimaginable even a decade ago. It's landed twice in Burma. A shot of the plane landing above a worn-out Havana street went viral.It's a perk of the office Obama has long said he'll miss when he leaves office.\"You take good care of me,\" he told graduating cadets at the Air Force Academy in June. \"You are always on time. You never lose my luggage. I don't have to take off my shoes before I get on.\"\"I am really going to miss Air Force One,\" he said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/politics/air-force-one-ride/index.html"}

{"_id":"What this itsy-bitsy virus took from a spider","articleText":" (CNN)You would expect a spider to excel at pulling strings, but in this case, it's a virus that appears to have pulled the strings of widow spiders -- DNA strings, that is.A husband-and-wife research team at Vanderbilt University in Nashville recently discovered eerily spider-like DNA hidden within an itsy-bitsy virus named WO.The newfound DNA is somewhat similar to a portion of the gene that makes widow spiders venomous, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications last week.\"This is the first time we've seen a possible transfer of genetic information between an animal and a bacterial virus,\" said Seth Bordenstein, a biologist at the university who co-authored the study with his wife and lab partner, Sarah Bordenstein.The new discovery may hold clues to how such viruses could be used as therapeutic tools.Along came a spiderWO is a bacteriophage, a tiny virus that infects and replicates within bacteria. Its main target is the bacterial parasite Wolbachia, which can live within black widow spiders and about 40% of the world's arthropods. Wolbachia had a recent claim to fame when scientists began using the bacterial strain to attack dengue- and Zika-carrying mosquitoes in an effort to curb the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Now that some secrets of WO's genetic makeup have been revealed, scientists could use that new insight to employ WO in making Wolbachia a more powerful weapon. In other words, scientists could use the virus to insert whatever they want into Wolbachia. Wolbachia then would infect a mosquito and could modify or manipulate mosquitoes from within.\"We imagine inserting genes into Wolbachia that make it a more potent tool in the fight against mosquito-borne diseases,\" said Sarah Bordenstein, a senior research specialist at Vanderbilt.For the study, the Bordensteins -- who have been studying WO for 15 years -- collected samples of the virus from insects infected with Wolbachia and sequenced its DNA.As the researchers analyzed the newly sequenced genome, they discovered a web that was more tangled than expected.\"What stood out to us was that this phage, or virus of bacteria, harbored a few genes that were animal-like in length and seemingly composed of a few snippets of animal-like sequences. This is a virus, or phage, that first and foremost infects bacteria -- though the bacteria themselves live in symbiosis with various insects and other animals,\" Sarah Bordenstein said.How the virus acquired this animal-like DNA remains a mystery, Seth Bordenstein added. It probably began with a spider.\"While the evidence suggests that phage WO may have acquired DNA from the spiders, rather than vice versa, we are still not completely sure of the origin. It is also possible that the sequences evolved in spiders and phage WO separately,\" he said.'The advantage of a bacteriophage'Phages are inherently mosaic, in the sense that they can acquire chunks of DNA from all kinds of places, said Ry Young, a professor at Texas A&M University and director of the university's Center for Phage Technology, who was not involved in the new study.  However, the study is the first time such a large segment of eukaryotic, or animal, DNA with intact genes has been discovered in a phage genome, Young said. \"I think the results are stunning,\" he said of the study. \"I suspect that a lot of biologists are going to go back and look at their old phage sequences and discover they overlooked or didn't believe that some genes were on them.\"Young added that the new study also might hold clues to how a bacteriophage could be used as a therapeutic tool to treat bacterial infections in humans.\"In the past, phages have been thought of as bad candidates to use therapeutically against bacteria that propagate inside human cells,\" Young said. The new study, however, demonstrates otherwise and that a phage could get in and out of an animal cell and a bacterial cell to attack a possible illness.\"The advantage of a bacteriophage over chemical antibiotics is that there would be no side effects, since they would be targeted against the disease bacterium and would not kill the normal, and very important, bacteria in the human intestinal tract,\" he said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/health/virus-black-widow-spider/index.html"}
{"_id":"What to know about the future of Obamacare","articleText":" (CNN)The election has ended, and a new President and new Congress will take office on January 1. Among the most heated issues during the campaign season was the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The law, which was signed in 2010, has faced mixed reviews since its inception, from both politicians and the public.The most recent Health Tracking Poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focused on health policy, found an even split in the public's opinion of Obamacare. Equal numbers of Americans -- 45% -- said their view was favorable or unfavorable.The public never seemed to learn the nitty-gritty of the law, according to Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser.\"People don't really know that much about the law and how it works, and their understanding is shaped by stuff they pick up here or there on the news or social media,\" Pollitz said. \"This has been a problem all along with the Affordable Care Act that our tracking polls have just, sadly, documented year after year.\"All the buzz about a possible repeal under President Trump, said Pollitz, has raised even more questions.To help understand Obamacare today, here are answers to seven common questions.Will Obamacare be repealed?  Both President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said that repealing and replacing Obamacare is a legislative priority.In an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" after the election, Trump repeated his intention to replace the ACA. \"We're going to repeal it and replace it,\" he said. Though he said his new plan would offer \"great health care for much less money,\" he did not outline a replacement plan.Yet, after his 90-minute meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump seemed to be reconsidering this policy, based on remarks he made to The Wall Street Journal.  \"Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\" he said, adding that he told Obama he \"will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.\"The GOP-led House of Representatives has voted to repeal Obamacare multiple times, so most observers believe it will probably do so again.Despite the firmly stated intentions of Trump and the Republican Party, pulling the plug on Obamacare is \"unlikely,\" given a probable filibuster by Senate Democrats, Michael Sparer of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University wrote in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine.Sparer believes Obamacare will undergo major changes, with Republicans repealing significant portions of the law through the budget reconciliation process, which cannot be filibustered. He notes, though, that all of Obamacare cannot be repealed that way. What would replace Obamacare? This is not entirely clear, though Trump has outlined some of his intentions on his website and along the campaign trail. According to the plan, Obamacare will be replaced with tax-free health savings accounts. Account funds will be available for use by any family member and can accumulate over time and can be transferred, tax-free, to all heirs.  Trump's website also indicates that he hopes to create a \"dynamic market\" by allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines. Those who buy insurance in this market would deduct their premiums on their tax returns.Under Trump, Medicaid would be managed and administered by individual states and funded by block grants: a fixed amount of federal money.  Trump's website also indicates that he will work with states to establish high-risk pools to ensure access to coverage for people who want it, including those who have not maintained continuous coverage. Trump's website notes that he hopes to increase price transparency for health care services and to allow consumers to import drugs from overseas.It also says the individual mandate must be eliminated: \"No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.\"\"Everybody's got to be covered,\" he said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year. \"I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\"What happens to people with pre-existing conditions?Obamacare prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, or charging people higher or lower fees based on their health status.At CNN's GOP debate in February, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare but maintain the provision that insurers must cover people with pre-existing conditions. \"I want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it,\" he said.After meeting with Obama, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he would like to keep the provision forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.And this month on \"60 Minutes,\" he repeated his wish to continue coverage for those individuals.\"It happens to be one of the strongest assets,\" Trump said.What happens to children on their parents' insurance?Currently, Obamacare allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.On \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he would try to keep this measure in place if he repeals and replaces Obamacare.What happens to birth control expenses?Currently, it is possible to get free birth control under the Affordable Care Act. By law, Obamacare health plans must cover, without charging out-of-pocket fees, at least one type of birth control in each of the 18 Food and Drug Administration-approved categories. A repeal of Obamacare, then, might imperil women's access to free birth control unless a replacement continues this provision.Generally, it is unclear where Trump stands on the issue of birth control. During a September interview on \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" he said he's not in favor of requiring a prescription to purchase birth control. \"I would say it should not be a prescription; it should not be done by prescription,\" he said. Notably, despite the fact that the FDA has never approved hormonal contraceptive products for over-the-counter sale, three West Coast states allow pharmacies to sell these products without a doctor's prescription. Trump's website indicates that he intends to remove barriers for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. So this commitment to lower drug costs, combined with Trump's opinion that contraceptives be available without prescription, could mean low-cost, though not entirely free, over-the-counter contraceptives will be available even if Obamacare is repealed.When would changes to Obamacare occur? Sixty Senate votes are required to overcome a filibuster. To reach 60 votes, at least eight Democrats would be required to lend their support to the Republican agenda. Although the Democratic Party says it will not undermine the law, Republicans believe they might be able to convince some moderate Democrats -- especially those running for re-election in 2018 in more conservative states -- to vote for health care legislation.Republicans have suggested that passing a replacement bill could take up two years.\"We're not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing,\" Trump said on \"60 Minutes\" this month.Should I still sign up for a 2017 plan?If you have no health insurance and want it, sign up for a plan during the open enrollment period, which runs through January 31.  \"It's available. It's open enrollment. There are subsidies and people who can help you. All of that is still in place,\" Kaiser's Pollitz said.Policies and premiums displayed on marketplace websites during open enrollment will be in effect throughout 2017, with plans written for a full calendar year.  That said, people are not obligated to continue their policies for a full year. If you got a job with health benefits, say, or if repeal does occur, you would not be required to remain enrolled and continue paying premiums.However, the plan would be obliged to pay any claims you had incurred up until the time the coverage stopped, explained Pollitz.  Currently, under Obamacare, people who can afford but do not purchase insurance must pay an individual mandate penalty when filing their income taxes.  This requirement to have coverage remains in effect, Pollitz said.\"The law is still on the books, and people still get sick and hit by cars, so having insurance is still a good thing,\" Pollitz said.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/questions-about-obamacare-answered/index.html"}

{"_id":"What was Oakland's Ghost Ship?","articleText":" (CNN)As far as city officials in Oakland, California, were concerned, the dilapidated two-story structure at 1305 31st Avenue with the cracked, rusting facade was a warehouse in disrepair. The building's owner received a citation in November for hazardous trash and debris surrounding the building, the second such complaint in two years. Zoning officials were also investigating complaints of illegal construction on the property. To the artists who lived and worked there, the \"Ghost Ship\" was a rare haven in the Bay Area's gentrifying landscape of skyrocketing rents and disappearing artist spaces. On Friday night, it became the scene of one of Oakland's most devastating fires in recent memory. More than 30 people were killed and the death toll is expected to rise as investigators sift through the treacherous ruins of studios, workshops and residences tucked within the warehouse: pianos, couches, beds, even mobile homes, Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said.The blaze broke out during an electronic dance party, sending shock waves through Oakland's tight-knit arts community. As the news spread, it seemed nearly everyone knew somebody who was supposed to be at the show or who had once passed through the warehouse, said Josette Melchor, executive director of Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, which launched an online fundraiser for victims of the fire.It was one of many gatherings the venue's leaseholder, Derick Ion Almena, was known to host to help pay rent on the warehouse, members of the Bay Area art community told CNN. Most people familiar with Ghost Ship knew it had issues, that it was not quite up to code, Melchor said. So it goes for many live-work warehouses as they struggle to accommodate increasing demand for affordable art spaces. Fear of losing a home or displacing others keeps some people from reporting possible violations, she said.\"People are desperate for places,\" she said. \"It's one of those things where you don't want to report something you see because you know how hard it is for people to find spaces.\" The Ghost Ship fire represents a rare case in the extreme, she said. Most art spaces go to great lengths to maintain safe environments, especially when they open to the public for events.\"It's one of those Catch-22 situations. A lot of us knew it was unsafe and it could have been fine had there been a smaller amount of people,\" she said. \"But when you start having big parties it crosses the line.\"","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/california-oakland-fire-ghost-ship-warehouse/index.html"}
{"_id":"What you gain and lose with meal replacements","articleText":" (CNN)The meal replacement company Soylent offers grab-and-go drinks and bars designed to be consumed in place of sitting down for a meal -- but, for now, the company is urging customers to throw out its Soylent Bars.The bars have been making some people sick, according to reports, and the company is investigating why \"a small number of our customers have experienced gastrointestinal issues after consuming Soylent Bars.\"It's offering customers full refunds.\"Until we are absolutely certain our products are safe, they will not be shipped,\" it said in a blog post. \"We are deeply sorry if any customer had any negative experiences after eating a Soylent Bar.\"Meanwhile, the rest of the world might be wondering: Why were people eating a single bar for dinner to begin with? The company aims to give customers a convenient way to consume the same sustenance and nutrition found in a balanced meal. Many meal replacement brands -- such as Soylent, Ambronite, SlimFast and Ample -- claim to be able to replace real food in our lives with ready-to-consume shakes or bars.But are they actually effective?It depends on what you're replacingFor the average healthy adult, meal replacement bars or shakes seem to be beneficial only when they are replacing an unhealthy food item in your daily diet, said Sharon Akabas, associate director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University.\"The question is, what would the person do if they didn't eat the bar or drink the shake? Would they go to a fast food place and have a burger, fries and sweet beverage instead of the shake? In that case, any health specialist would say, go for the shake,\" Akabas said.Meal replacements can help with portion control, said Rachel Lustgarten, a registered dietitian at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.\"This is something that comes up a lot for me in practice,\" she said. \"Whole food, eating real food, tends to be the most satisfying way to go for most people. However, I am not down on meal replacements entirely, particularly for people looking to lose weight or control weight. For those clients, using meal replacements can sometimes be a great way to jump-start weight loss because they are portion-controlled, high in protein and low in sugar.\"Additionally, meal replacements are sometimes used to help feed sick patients who can't keep any food down, said Charles Mueller, clinical associate professor of nutrition at New York University.\"There's a place for meal replacements when people are really having trouble eating for one reason or another, but for healthy, free-living people of any age, they should be eating whole food, and they should be taking the time and the effort to do so,\" Mueller said.Otherwise, \"you're missing out on the healthy bacteria; you're missing out on all the nutrients contained in food; you're missing out on the dietary fiber, which are what we call prebiotics, and literally, the roughage in the diet stimulates the gastrointestinal lining,\" he said. \"Most meal replacements kind of don't do much for any of that.\"Feeding the bacteria in your gutThough many meal replacement products claim to offer the same amount of protein, carbohydrates, lipids and micronutrients that consumers would find in a whole food meal, they tend to lack the fiber and good bacteria needed to maintain the ecosystem of microorganisms, or microbiota, inside of you. That ecosystem is called your body's microbiome.\"Your microbiome works closely with gastrointestinal immunity,\" Mueller said.\"Whole foods provide fiber, which is substrate or food for the microbiota. Food is full of bacteria, and you tend to develop a microbiome that profiles your diet wherever you live,\" he said. \"There's a French microbiome; there's a Ugandan microbiome; there's a Mexican microbiome; you can go to Chile, and you find very specific profiles. We have very sophisticated technology now to classify the different types of organisms that live in our guts, and they are very dependent on how we eat, and they're very closely linked to chronic disease.\"The human gut shelters a sophisticated community with trillions of microbial cells that can influence physiology, metabolism, nutrition and even immune function. Any change in diet can affect that community, Mueller said.Solid foods also are an important part of a daily diet because they can stimulate the movement of muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, Mueller added. Many meal replacement products come in liquid form.\"Your gastrointestinal tract is a big muscle that likes to work out, and it likes to push and pull food, and when it doesn't get to do that all the time on a constant basis, it's not as healthy, just like a person who stops exercising,\" Mueller said.'This isn't rocket science; it's harder'There also is the act of sitting at a table and interacting with your food that can make a difference in how satisfied you feel during mealtime, which might not happen if you are consuming on-the-go meal replacement products.\"Meal replacements, because they're high in protein, tend to do a pretty good job in satisfying our physical hunger. They are quick and convenient, but some people might not feel as satisfied mentally since there is no chewing and actual eating involved,\" Lustgarten said.\"For some people, eating a meal of whole foods will feel more satisfying even if they feel just as physically full after having a meal replacement drink,\" she said, \"and that tends to be more mental as opposed to just physical.\"The benefits of fresh produce compared with meal replacements can be so nuanced that they have become a topic of ongoing research, Akabas said.\"This isn't rocket science; it's harder,\" she said. \"We can send someone to space and bring them back in the same aircraft, and we still don't know what should go into a blender for complete nutrition for a long period of time for the general population.\"Among the general population, though, a preference for meal replacements appears to vary by age.Your age makes a differenceMore recently, meal replacement brands -- such as Soylent and Ambronite -- seem to target busy young professionals who may not have the time to cook a traditional meal.However, older adults are more likely to find satisfaction in a monotonous meal replacement diet, according to a small study published in the journal Physiology & Behavior in 2000.The study involved 18 young adults and 14 older adults who completed questionnaires about their food cravings and preferences, as well as cognitive testing, and then were placed on a 19-day diet. During the first seven days of the diet, the participants were asked to incorporate a vanilla-flavored nutritious beverage in their daily meals. Then, from the eighth to 12th day, they were instructed to consume only the beverage and nothing else. For the last week of the diet, the study participants returned to eating normal meals.The participants were asked to keep food diaries, in which they recorded whether they experienced any cravings during the liquid diet.After examining the diaries, the researchers found that the older adults reported significantly fewer food cravings than the young adults. In fact, older men reported almost no cravings at any time during the study. Older adults were also more likely than the young adults, on average, to enjoy the vanilla-flavored drink and not mind the monotony.\"Complaints about chalkiness came primarily from younger adults, and the older adults didn't have those complaints,\" said Marcia Pelchat, an associate member emerita at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia and a co-author of the study.\"As people age, their sense of smell becomes less acute, and that explains why the younger adults say the beverages have a chemical or vitamin flavor, because that's primarily smell,\" she explained. A meal (replacement) to start the dayPelchat said there is one occasion, however, where satisfaction with food monotony seems common across all ages.\"Breakfast: People are much more likely to eat the same thing for breakfast every day than they are for lunch or for dinner, and you might think that they get bored, but they don't,\" she said.Some meal replacement brands even market their products as morning food items, such as Carnation Instant Breakfasts. \"Sometimes people think starting a program like this has to be all or nothing and that they have to replace all their meals, which can sometimes set people up for failure,\" said Lustgarten, the registered dietitian.\"You don't need to commit to doing this every single day. This might be your breakfast on the weekdays or during lunch when you have a meeting,\" she said. \"If people are feeling confused about how to implement this, talk to your doctor or get a referral to see a dietitian.\"No matter how you might implement meal replacements in your daily routine, experts say to make sure you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need.'Food is a part of culture'\"There certainly is a lot of science behind meal replacement for a few different reasons. In some cases, it can help people with a limited ability to digest and absorb food, so hospital-based patients, and there's a long history of meal replacements for weight management,\" said Akabas, the nutrition expert at Columbia University.\"But they have often gotten a bad name because of manufacturing's role in making claims that are too good to be true,\" she said. \"We have no single food that includes the nutrients that would be needed to sustain someone across the lifespan of any significant period of time, so anyone who makes a claim otherwise is over-reaching.\"Plus, there's more to food than just nutrients, Pelchat said.\"I would hate to see us reduced to being a society that just consumed nutrients to survive,\" she said. \"Food is a part of culture, and the meal plays so many important roles in communication and customs. The history of a culture is really reflected in consuming food. ... It would be a shame to lose all of that.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/health/soylent-meal-replacement-diets/index.html"}
{"_id":"What's different about Donald Trump's phone calls with world leaders?","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump's transition is being viewed at home as chaotic, and his move from candidate to statesman is being closely scrutinized by the global media as well, particularly his communications with world leaders. Once again, Trump has bucked past practices for a more unorthodox approach, leaving many wondering if this signals an overhaul in US political procedure and a taste of things to come.What protocol has Trump not followed?Traditionally, the President-elect turns to the State Department for briefings prior to taking or returning calls from heads of state or government. This was how the transition team coordinated its international outreach strategy for then President-elect Barack Obama in 2008. The State Department said it wasn't contacted until Thursday, after Trump had already spoken with several leaders.Why has this been problematic?This appears to have contributed to confusion from several foreign governments wishing to offer the incoming President their congratulations on his victory. A diplomatic source has told CNN that one US partner had to make multiple attempts in contacting the Trump camp to successfully arrange a phone call between their head of state and the President-elect.When calls were finally arranged, they were connected without any appearance of vetting or confirmation of the individual calling, according to several diplomats who spoke to CNN. Illustrating some of the unconventional approaches international leaders have taken, the Australian prime minister was supplied with Trump's cell phone number by golfing legend Greg Norman after Joe Hockey, Australia's ambassador to the US, contacted him seeking the information. Presidential transition explained How does it differ to Obama?Back in 2008, Obama returned 22 calls from foreign leaders in what was described at the time as a considered strategy prioritizing leaders from countries with strategic importance and the time they called, according to Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. Trump's transition team have released a list of 29 foreign leaders that it said have spoken to the President-elect and vice president-elect. It did not specify if all leaders spoke to both men, or if some only spoke to Trump or Pence.  CNN has made several attempts to independently verify which leaders spoke to the President-elect and confirmed that he has spoken with the prime ministers of Ireland, Australia, Canada, Japan, Italy, Israel, Denmark and the UK in addition to the presidents of Egypt, Russia, Turkey, France, China, Mexico, Argentina, South Korea and Ukraine. Trump has also spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Saudi King Salman bin Abdelaziz Al-Saud. Calls and emails to the remaining nine heads of government to find out if they spoke with Trump went unanswered. CNN has not verified which world leaders also spoke to Pence.Presidential transitions: Why they can be a risky time The President-elect responded to media reports querying what appears to be a random call sheet for foreign leaders.\"I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,\" he said in a tweet Wednesday. Before adding in a second post: \"Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.\"What does it tell us about Trump as a world leader?The unusual nature of Trump's campaign has followed him into the transition phase and his apparently unsystematic technique for speaking to world leaders has raised eyebrows.\"It's all a bit haphazard as far as I can see. It doesn't seem to follow any logical order,\" former British ambassador to US Christopher Meyer told CNN.\"I wouldn't attach much importance to it except that it's all part of the learning process for him as well ... It's all part of getting used to being President-elect and then President.\"However, Leslie Vinjamuri, an associate professor in international relations at SOAS, University of London, told CNN that Trump's preference in communications with Russia has \"caused anxiety among America's European allies.\"\"It is short-sighted not to turn first to the United Kingdom,\" said Vinjamuri, who also serves on the council of Chatham House. \"Inevitably, any president of the United States will eventually recognize the absolutely essential role of the UK-US relationship.\"If we accept that first impressions matter, it is obvious that Trump's path to diplomatic success is going to be longer than it needs to be.\"Meanwhile, Meyer said that the reports of international leaders bypassing traditional protocols -- as in the case of the Australian prime minster -- is \"unusual,\" but also to be expected somewhat considering Trump's political credentials.\"I haven't the faintest idea how this happened,\" the erstwhile UK envoy said. \"I would say this is all part of the process of the President-elect learning the rules of the game as he goes along. What else would you expect -- he's never been in government.\"Opinion: Keys to a successful Trump transition What are the potential repercussions?Considering how unprecedented the President-elect's campaign turned out to be, so too are his early moves in his presidency. For Meyer, spectators across the globe shouldn't be surprised by the fact Trump is conducting himself differently.\"The whole campaign that he has fought -- both in the primaries and the presidential has been totally different -- smashing all the conventions.\"The big question for outsiders, and I guess also for Americans, is which Trump is going to turn up in the Oval Office,\" he added.But this visible shift in US presidential communication strategy has been a warning flare, said Vinjamuri.\"Donald Trump's campaign has certainly alerted us to the fact that he will not be a leader who plays by a well-recognized rule book,\" she explained. \"This could be very damaging especially in the realm of international diplomacy, where many of America's partners are accustomed to the deliberative and carefully considered approach of President Obama.\"Vinjamuri continued: \"But even more so, Trump has demonstrated a failure of imagination when it comes to evaluating the consequences of his words and actions on third parties. This will be potentially devastating for America's ability to forge strong relationships with key allies.\"CNN's Elise Labott, Kara Fox and Mark Oliver contributed to this report.

{"_id":"When in Rome ","articleText":" (CNN)When in Rome, don't do as the Romans do. At least if you're a photographer. A city home to ancient architecture like the Coliseum and the Pantheon and magnificent religious structures like St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, Rome has no shortage of beautiful sights to photograph. But as British photographer Ian Berry discovered while trying to capture the Eternal City in 2013, the challenge lies in avoiding clichés. \"Once you've spent a day in the Coliseum, you find everyone and their mother has photographed the Coliseum and finding some new way of presenting it is not always easy,\" Berry says.Berry instead juxtaposed the ancient and the modern by capturing the vibrant people of the city against the classic scenes that have charmed the world. His photographs showcase Rome as both the immensely popular, bustling tourist destination that it is and the laidback, European city that so many Italians call home. A young woman wearing a bright pink dress and straw hat gestures grandly to the Pantheon. A director sits slumped over in a red velvet theater seat waiting exhaustedly for his actors to arrive for rehearsal. Tourists go window-shopping along the Via Condotti riding rented Segways. A couple of men leisurely play chess outside a café. A taxi driver practices his silver trumpet while stationed in a long taxi queue. With its high fashion, luxury automobiles and mouth-watering food, Rome is a culture capital of the world. The city is the birthplace of haute couture houses Valentino and Fendi and home to some of the world's most renowned artists, like Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. Rome's ever-so-stylish people can be seen cruising along on Lambrettas and Vespas on the city's streets, or zipping by in Lamborghinis, Maseratis and Ferraris. There's something for everyone in Rome, Berry says, and that's why it's one of his favorite cities.\"You can walk everywhere, terrific piazzas, the food. Go to Trastevere at night for the food, it's fantastic,\" Berry recommends. \"Via Veneto to see the would-be models and film stars. The Via dei Gracchi for terrific shopping. The Vatican on a Sunday morning. It's a terrific place to be.\" The city, Berry says, is full of moments waiting to be captured. \"Wherever you wait in Rome, in five minutes a couple will turn out and start necking,\" Berry says. \"If you're at the Vatican on a Sunday morning, there are always loads of nuns wandering around, priests and tourists coming for religious reasons. People are on the street all the time. Everybody's talking. The whole world is there.\"Ian Berry is a photographer from England. He is represented by Magnum Photos.

{"_id":"Where Thanksgiving calories hide -- and how to burn them off","articleText":" (CNN)When you sit down to a traditional Thanksgiving meal, the cards will be stacked against your diet. Those favorite dishes are just so high in calories -- hello, stuffing and sweet potato casserole! -- and there are just so many of them, it can seem impossible not to splurge.But with the right planning and a serving of willpower, you can have a healthy (or healthier) Thanksgiving. How to dish up a healthier meal\"My advice is to do everything in moderation. Normally, people scoop up mounds of stuff on their plate, and that's where it gets to be a problem. But if you can handle small portion sizes, then that's fine,\" said Sara Haas, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. And just because you are going to indulge during that one meal of the day doesn't mean that you have to blow the others. \"Balance it with good meals at breakfast and lunch and do some exercise ... think about how much better you'll feel by the time you get to Thanksgiving dinner,\" Haas said.When it comes time to feast, there are steps you can take to keep from overeating, or at least to limit it. Haas recommends putting your fork down and taking a sip of water between bites to keep from shoveling food in your mouth. And wait at least 20 minutes before going back for seconds (or thirds) -- it takes your body about that much time to know that it is full, she said.Of course, if you are the one doing the cooking, there are lots of steps you can take to make your Thanksgiving dinner healthier. Using low-fat meats and dairy products is one easy way to lower the calorie load -- and in foods such as stuffing and pies, you probably won't even notice the difference. Haas recommends sources such as Cooking Light and Eat Right, the website of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, for beloved recipes made healthier, and for turning those mountains Thanksgiving leftovers into creative, and possibly healthier dishes.How to burn Thanksgiving calories Even if you choose the healthiest sides on the table, eat only one slice of pie and keep your leftover plans in check, you might still need  some activity to break even on Thanksgiving. Consider looking for a race to run around the holiday, or just go jogging in your neighborhood -- 60 minutes of jogging burns about 477 calories -- about one slice of pecan pie. Sixty minutes of Zumba burns about 540 calories -- that almost takes care of your sweet potato casserole and your cranberry sauce.An hour of tossing around a football with your family burns about 160 calories. There goes the turkey!But there are plenty of ways to cut back without tying on your athletic shoes.An hour spent clearing and washing dishes will burn about 100 calories. Another hour of mopping up after the big meal can burn more than 100. Cleanup could be the cure for green bean casserole.There's good news, too, if you're hanging out at the kids' table. An hour of carrying around small children can burn about 136 calories. Running around with them for 60 minutes can burn more than 200. See you later, stuffing.Planning to line up for Black Friday sales? Thirty minutes of shopping can burn 76 calories -- if you're moving fast enough to score a few big deals and long enough to cover everyone on your list, you can easily take care of your mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/11/23/health/thanksgiving-dinner-calories-workouts/index.html"}
{"_id":"Where are the world's happiest countries?","articleText":" (CNN)Fans of Denmark must be even happier than usual: Denmark has retaken the title of \"world's happiest country,\" knocking Switzerland into second place. Denmark and Switzerland were closely followed by Iceland, Norway and Finland, according to the World Happiness Report Update 2016, released Wednesday in Rome by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations. Denmark won the title three of the four times the report has been issued, losing to Switzerland only once.People in Burundi are the least satisfied with their lives, according to the survey of 156 countries, but residents of Benin (153rd place), Afghanistan (154), Togo (155) and Syria (156) aren't doing much better. The United States ranked 13th in overall happiness, lagging behind Canada (6), the Netherlands (7), New Zealand (8), Australia (9), Sweden (10), Israel (11) and Austria (12). Germany came in 16th place, while other superpowers -- the United Kingdom (23), Japan (53), Russia (56) and China (83) -- were markedly lower. Some countries that saw drops suffered economic and political turmoil -- including Greece, Italy and Spain -- while Ukraine's political trouble and violence likely caused a significant drop in happiness there. Measuring happiness is importantHappiness is a better measure of human welfare than measuring education, health, poverty, income and good government separately, the report's editors argue. There are at least seven key ingredients of happiness: People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies, have more social support, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption, experience more generosity, experience less inequality of happiness and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows.\"Measuring self-reported happiness and achieving well-being should be on every nation's agenda as they begin to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the report's co-editor and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, in a statement. \"Indeed the goals themselves embody the very idea that human well-being should be nurtured through a holistic approach that combines economic, social and environmental objectives,\" Sachs said. \"Rather than taking a narrow approach focused solely on economic growth,we should promote societies that are prosperous, just, and environmentally sustainable.\" Not just about the moneyIceland and Ireland both suffered through banking crises that dramatically affected their economies but didn't greatly affect their happiness, according to the report. What both countries have is a high degree of social support, enough to put Iceland in third place and Ireland in 19th place this year, according to the report. Strictly focusing on financial well-being can obscure the larger picture, according to the University of British Columbia's John Helliwell.\"In Norway, it's quite common for people to paint each other's houses even though they can all afford to pay to have their houses painted,\" said Helliwell, a report co-editor and co-director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\"They go out of their way to help each other, and it becomes a social event, and those events are enormously supportive of well-being,\" Helliwell said. \"In the commercialization of activity -- when people are more likely to buy things than to do them for themselves and each other -- we lose something along the way.\"Inequality of happinessIt turns out that people are also happier in countries where there's less inequality of well-being, the report found. And happiness inequality has increased significantly \"in most countries and regions of the world,\" said Helliwell, comparing 2012-15 data with 2005-11 data. The country of Bhutan, a tiny country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, ranked No. 1 in happiness equality, followed by Comoros and the Netherlands. South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Liberia had the highest happiness inequality. A country may have really rich and really poor people, and the poor people don't have enough money to construct a good life for themselves, he said. Or people may have money but have no social support or friends, or live in an area where there's government corruption or lack of freedom to make their own life choices.  The birth of 'Gross National Happiness'It's no surprise that Bhutan would come out on top, despite not being a world economic power: Its Prime Minister proposed a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011 and launched this international focus on happiness.Following in Bhutan's footsteps, the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012, recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world.\"  In recent years, other countries have made happiness a public policy goal of their governments. Bhutan, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have all appointed \"Minsters of Happiness\" to focus on the happiness of their people.

(CNN)\"A fight is going on inside me,\" said an old man to his grandson. \"It is a terrible fight, and it is between two wolves,\" one good and one bad. So goes a version of a traditional Cherokee legend (or a modern Billy Graham story).The first wolf embodies emotions and vices such as hate, greed, arrogance, dishonesty, anger, false pride, superiority and ego. The other wolf represents values and virtues such as peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, empathy, generosity, truth and compassion.The grandson considers the metaphoric battle and asks, \"Which wolf will win?\"The grandfather answers, \"The one you feed.\"This struggle is ours. Every day, we have the opportunity to embrace a darker path or to act in a more helpful and hopeful way.The same struggle is sometimes evident in entire nations, which can be deeply divided along a number of overlapping fault lines: political, socioeconomic, racial, gender.This story holds a mirror up to ourselves, individually and collectively. And we should take a long look in it. If we're honest about the struggle and understand it more, we can begin feeding one wolf over the other.Starve one wolfThe feeling of anger or the impulse of greed is often triggered by other emotions such as fear, rejection or desperation. Often, we're not even aware that secondary emotions like anger have a deeper root cause. \"Fear is the path to the dark side,\" Yoda explains in one of the \"Star Wars\" films. \"Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\"The first step in managing your emotions is simply being more aware of them. Ask yourself what triggers them. Look at your life experience for clues to how you react.  And of course, in some circumstances, anger and even hate are justified, perhaps useful. We should be angry at disparity. We should hate injustice.But whether an emotion is justified or not, negative emotions often lead to negative actions. If you take a primary feeling like fear or uncertainty and avoid turning that into hate, you are less likely to act in a hateful way. Embrace the feelings, but guide them toward the good.\"I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it,\" explained the late Andy Rooney, the Yoda of television news magazines.You are also in control of your social and media influences. If you are barraged with messages of hate and bitterness, they will more easily impinge on your self-control. It's important to stay informed, but be wary of listening to those who are in the business of feeding angry wolves.Feed the other wolfStaying in a positive and empathetic headspace is challenging, especially in times of stress, but again, being mindful of your emotions is vital.And just as hatred and closed-mindedness can eventually lead to acts of violence, love often leads to acts of peace and kindness.Committing ourselves to sustaining such action is the way to personal and institutional progress. Seek out and employ strategies to staying committed to something over time, whether it's the repetition-and-reward of a new habit or the tracking of a New Year's resolution.What feeding the good wolf looks like, practically, can include these actions:• Send a positive message. Whether it's on your Facebook feed or in conversations, communicate the good, the hope, the love.• Get involved. Give money or time, as you can, to a cause or effort that will use it to amplify positive change. It doesn't need to be political, either; it could be supporting public media or improving the environment or literacy, or an organization supporting folks who need financial help or are sick. • Share love. Make a list of 12 people in your life and check them off as you express in a conversation, email or letter how important they are to you.• Listen. We all need to be heard. Take a little more time and really give your attention to others. Listening is love, and it naturally creates bonds of empathy and support.• Help someone you know. Identify one person among your friends and family who is particularly struggling, and understand more about what they need and how you can help.• Be kind to strangers. Kindness is contagious, a fact backed by real science. Be a patient zero to everyone you come across.• Add to this list, and share. Come up with more things you can do to increase the total amount of goodness and positivity in the world, do some of those things and share those ideas with others.We can fix everything that's wrong with us by what's right with us. And to crib another presidential campaign line, we are the change we've been waiting for.This call to action is echoed by a lyric in the song \"Man in the Mirror,\" by Michael Jackson, who arguably struggled with his own inner wolves. \"If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then make a change.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/health/two-wolves-wisdom-project/index.html"}

{"_id":"White nationalism, a term once on the fringes, now front and center","articleText":" (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor swept a new term out of the fringes and into the mainstream: white nationalism.Bannon, the Trump campaign CEO and executive chairman of Breitbart News, has called his site \"the platform for the alt-right,\" a far-right movement that has been linked to white nationalism, racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism.So, what exactly is \"white nationalism\"? Activists on the front lines of fighting racism say it denotes white domination and superiority.Promoting the interest of whitesOren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism, said white nationalism is a term for a form of white supremacy or separatism.Its supporters defend \"country by white racial identity.\" They promote the interests of whites exclusively and denigrate all others.\"Bannon established himself as the chief curator of news for the alt-right,\" he said. \"And when you descrbe Breibart as a platform for the alt-right that's not insignificant.\"\"Under his stewardship, Breitbart emerged as a leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and hate.\"White dominationMark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the term white nationalism means white domination. It isn't necessarily an endorsement of a 100% pure white society, a goal now regarded by the far right as unrealistic, he said. \"White nationalism is more the idea that whites should dominate,\" he said, that the culture should dominate and policies that jibe with the idea should be supported, such as opposing nonwhite immigration.White nationalists believe the country \"should be built by and for white people.\" They \"tend to be less about ethnic slurs, less about Nazi slurs, tend to speak more academic language.\" Some people who embrace the white nationalist identity refer to themselves as \"race realists\" -- generally speaking, that means people who believe the races can't live together. They may also call themselves \"Identitarians,\" a movement that emerged last decade on the French far right. The movement is linked to the opposition to multiculturalism and anti-Islam attitudes.'The people I'm describing don't live in Washington'Paul Gottfried is the former Horace Raffensperger professor of humanities at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. He is also the president of the H.L. Mencken Club, which calls itself a \"society for the independent right.\"He said \"white nationalism is more often used by the left than on the alternative right\" and that \"white Identitarian\" and \"race realist\" are the terms more common on the alt-rightGottfried rejected the view that Bannon is a racist, an anti-Semite, a white Identitarian or race realist. Instead, Gottfried said, Bannon comes from the world of Washington politics and journalism.\"The people I'm describing don't live in Washington,\" he said, when making reference to race realists and Identitarians. \"I don't think he knows any of those people.\"'I like the term alt-right'A major voice of the alt-right is Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and the editor of Radix Journal. He defines \"white nationalism\" as a U.S.-focused movement concerning white racial consciousness and identity.\"I don't use the term white nationalist to describe myself,\" he said. \"I understand it's a fairly fair term. Obviously white refers to race, of European descent.\"To the extent that nationalism means caring for one's family, that is a good thing, he said.But the word \"nationalism\" reflects deep-seated historical grudges, \"ethno-nationalism,\" in which Europeans warred with one another.\"We want to get beyond these things,\" Spencer said. \"I like the term alt-right. It has an openness to it. And immediately understandable. We're coming from a new perspective.\"He prefers the terms Identitarian and alt-right.Alt-right, he said, \"has a new starting point from conventional conservative. That was the origin of it.\" \"It's been filled out and come into its own. It's an Identitarian movement. Race realism is a component of it. It's an understanding of European identity.\"Distancing themselves from white supremacyDaryl Johnson is the owner of DT Analytics, with DT standing for domestic terrorism. He is a security consultant and a former counterterrorism expert at the Department of Homeland Security. Johnson was the primary author of a 2009 report about right-wing extremism that drew fierce outrage on the right.White nationalism is a \"new buzzword,\" Johnson said, but the first time he saw the term was in \"white supremacy literature.\" The far rightists used \"white nationalism\" to appear more credible and patriotic, Johnson said, and the term detracts from the stereotypes conjured by white supremacy.

NPI's leader is Richard Spencer, known for coining the term \"alt-right\" and promoting white supremacist views.The event drew hundreds of protesters holding anti-fascist signs and yelling chants including, \"No Donald Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" One held a sign reading \"alt-wrong.\"The group was generally peaceful until a man and a woman from NPI approached the group with a video camera and microphone, prompting protesters to yell \"Nazis go home.\" The woman, who wouldn't give CNN her name but wore a badge saying \"Emily,\" appeared to interview a protester, asking him if he is a \"self-hating white person.\"Another protester knocked the man's video camera, and a scuffle ensued between the two. A few other protesters entered the fray yelling \"Die, Nazi, die,\" and the man from NPI reemerged with a bloody gash on his forehead. He declined to give his name.Two protesters were handcuffed by police.

{"_id":"White nationalists see advocate in Steve Bannon who will hold Trump to his campaign promises ","articleText":" (CNN)White nationalist leaders are praising Donald Trump's decision to name former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, telling CNN in interviews they view Bannon as an advocate in the White House for policies they favor. The leaders of the white nationalist and so-called \"alt-right\" movement — all of whom vehemently oppose multiculturalism and share the belief in the supremacy of the white race and Western civilization — publicly backed Trump during his campaign for his hardline positions on Mexican immigration, Muslims, and refugee resettlement. Trump has at times disavowed their support. Bannon's hiring, they say, is a signal that Trump will follow through on some of his more controversial policy positions. \"I think that's excellent,\" former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke told CNN's KFile. \"I think that anyone that helps complete the program and the policies that President-elect Trump has developed during the campaign is a very good thing, obviously. So it's good to see that he's sticking to the issues and the ideas that he proposed as a candidate. Now he's president-elect and he's sticking to it and he's reaffirming those issues.\"Duke, who last week lost his longshot bid for the US Senate seat from Louisiana, said he plans on expanding his radio show and is hoping to launch a 24 hour online news show with a similar  approach to Comedy Central's Daily Show. He argued Bannon's position was among the most important in the White House. \"You have an individual, Mr. Bannon, who's basically creating the ideological aspects of where we're going,\" added Duke. \"And ideology ultimately is the most important aspect of any government.\"Bannon, who was a Navy officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker years before taking over Breitbart, has called the site \"the platform for the alt-right.\" Under Bannon, Breitbart has taken an increasingly hardline tone on issues such as terrorism and immigration, running a headline after the Paris attacks of November 2015 saying, \"Paris Streets Turned Into Warzone By Violent Migrants.\" It also ran a headline in May 2016 calling anti-Trump, neoconservative commentator Bill Kristol a \"Renegade Jew.\" Bannon himself was accused of anti-Semitism by his ex-wife, who alleged in a 2007 court declaration that he did not want their daughter to attend a Los Angeles school because of the numbers of Jews who went to school there. (Bannon, through a spokesperson, denied his wife's accusations.) Peter Brimelow, who runs the white nationalist site VDARE, praised Bannon's hiring, saying it gives Trump a connection to the alt-right movement online.\"I think it's amazing,\" Brimelow said of Trump's decision to tap Bannon. \"Can you imagine Mitt Romney doing this? It's almost like Trump cares about ideas! Especially amazing because I would bet Trump doesn't read online. Few plutocrats do, they have efficient secretaries.\"Brimelow added his site would continue to focus solely on their hardline position on immigration, saying he expects American whites to vote their interests similar to other minority groups.  \"To the extent that the 'alt-right' articulates that interest, it will continue to grow,\" Brimelow said. Brad Griffin, a blogger who runs the white nationalist website Occidental Dissent using the pseudonym \"Hunter Wallace,\" said he thought Bannon's hiring showed Trump would be held to his campaign promises.\"It makes sense to me,\" he said. \"Reince [Priebus] can certainly get more done on Capitol Hill. He will be an instrument of Trump's will, not the other way around. Bannon is better suited as chief strategist and looking at the big picture. I think he will hold Trump to the promises he has already made during the campaign. We endorse many of those promises like building the wall, deportations, ending refugee resettlement, preserving the Second Amendment, etc. There's a lot of stuff in there on which almost everyone on the right agrees.\"Griffin added,  \"We're most excited though about the foreign policy implications of Bannon in the White House. We want to see our counterparts in Europe — starting in Austria and France — win their upcoming elections. We're hearing reports that Breitbart is expanding its operations in continental Europe and that is where our focus will be in 2017.\"Jared Taylor, who runs the site American Renaissance, echoed those comments, saying Bannon would help hold Trump to his campaign rhetoric.\"There has been some waffling on some of candidate Trump's signature positions: build the wall, deport illegals, end birth-right citizenship, take a hard look at Muslim immigrants, etc,\" he said. \"I suspect one of Steve Bannon's important functions will be as an anti-waffler, who will encourage President Trump to keep his campaign promises.\"Chairman of the American Nazi Party, Rocky J. Suhayda, who wrote a post after Trump's election night victory celebrating it as a call to action, said he was surprised at the pick of Bannon, but said it showed him Trump could follow through on his campaign promises. \"I must admit that I was a wee bit surprised that Mr. Trump finally chose Mr. Bannon, I thought that his stable of Washington insiders would have objected too vociferously,\" Suhayda wrote in an email. \"Perhaps The Donald IS for 'REAL' and is not going to be another controlled puppet directed by the usual 'Wire Pullers,' and does indeed intend to ROCK the BOAT? Time will tell.\"Richard B. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute, wrote a series of tweets on Sunday evening saying Bannon had the best position as chief strategist, allowing him to not get lost in the weeds and could help Trump focus on the big picture of setting up his agenda. \"Steve Bannon might even push Trump in the right direction. So that would be a wonderful thing,\" he told CNN on Sunday before the announcement, adding that he hopes to push Trump in an increasingly radical direction.\"Matt Parrott, a spokesman for the Traditionalist Worker Party, said Bannon was a \"civic nationalist\" — someone who sees an American identity not based on race. \"Steve Bannon has never been a white nationalist and it's kind of tiresome how the important distinction, everyone needs to learn them now that they're relevant. There's an important distinction between a civic nationalist and a white nationalist,\" Parrott to CNN. \"Steve Bannon's entire career, and if you look at Breitbart, like, he's accusing the other side of racism. That's something that wouldn't happen out of an actual white nationalist of course because we don't see being for your race as a negative thing. Yeah, Steve Bannon's a civic nationalist and that's much better than what was in Washington before. We're hopeful about the whole thing.\" Parrot added, \"We in the alt-right are going to be just as vicious in trolling and attacking the Republican Congress as they try to obstruct Trump's reforms as we were against the left.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/white-nationalists-on-bannon/index.html"}
{"_id":"Who is Jared Kushner?","articleText":"This story is an update of a report CNN did over the summer reflecting the changes in Jared Kushner's role in his father-in-law's political organization in the wake of Donald Trump winning the election.New York (CNN)News this week that Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is at the center of the infighting inside the President-elect's transition team highlights the larger role Kushner has carved out for himself since the campaign trail.The 35-year-old businessman-turned-political operative has had a crucial role in his father-in-law's incoming presidency and that is only expected to increase. A source with knowledge of this situation told CNN Tuesday that Kushner could likely end up with a top national security clearance as a key adviser to his father-in-law, a position which is expected for him.While Trump has shared much of the spotlight with his adult children, Donald Jr., Eric and Kushner's wife, Ivanka, the real estate mogul has also taken time publicly express his appreciation for the role his son-in-law has played largely behind the scenes.As he wrapped up the Republican nomination after a crucial victory in Indiana's primary earlier this year, Donald Trump singled out Kushner for praise, immediately after thanking his top campaign staffers, including then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope Hicks.\"Honestly, Jared is a very successful real estate person, but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. And he is very good at politics,\" Trump said.5 things that grabbed us about Corey LewandowskiKushner's business backgroundKushner's reaction to his father-in-law's flattery -- bashfully tilting his head downward, blushing at the compliment -- embodied the stark differences between the two men.While both expanded the real estate businesses their fathers built, Kushner has kept a relatively low-profile despite amassing billions of dollars in properties over his decade in the cutthroat New York real estate market.Trump cultivated his image and bolstered his brand in the New York tabloids with tales of sexual escapades, dates with models and hyperbolic valuations of real estate deals. And his campaign has been defined by his controversial and at-times outrageous proposals and no-holds-barred tactics.Kushner, by contrast, rarely sits for interviews and only rarely appears on television. And when he does, he doesn't abandon his shyness and mild-mannered demeanor.At just 25, Kushner delved into another industry, publishing, when he purchased The New York Observer in 2006, which just last week announced it would end its print edition and continue as an online-only publication.Jumping on the campaign trailAfter joining Trump sporadically on the campaign trail -- standing quietly alongside his wife for brief moments on stage before adoring crowds of Trump supporters -- Kushner took on his first campaign task by helping his father-in-law craft the policy and language for his speech in March before the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.The speech was no small affair for Trump, who used a teleprompter for the first time as he delivered the remarks before an audience skeptical of his commitment to protecting Israel.Kushner went on to add more responsibility within the campaign, spending more time with Trump. He helped the presumptive Republican nominee adjust to the reality of fundraising, which Trump largely eschewed during his primary campaign, a source told CNN.\"Jared has been very helpful on the fundraising side,\" the source said.Role in Lewandowski firing The abrupt firing in June of Lewandowski underscored Kushner's growing influence.He was \"intimately involved\" in the decision, one source told CNN, noticeably putting his power and influence to the test in making the case to Trump that he should dump Lewandowski. Kushner, along with Trump's children, repeatedly butted heads with Lewandowski, who they felt was undermining their efforts to steer Trump in a more positive direction, multiple sources said. And rumors also swirled that Lewandowski was trying to plant negative stories in the press about Kushner to undercut Kushner's influence.How Corey Lewandowski overplayed his handHours after his firing, even Lewandowski sang Kushner's praises.\"He's helped us from the onset,\" Lewandowski told CNN's Dana Bash, noting that Kushner has helped the campaign grow \"a stronger social media presence.\"Fired Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: 'No regrets'2004 controversyKushner is no stranger to controversy or the media glare.His life took dramatic turn in 2004 when his father Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and top Democratic campaign donor, was arrested and charged with federal crimes, including tax evasion, witness tampering and campaign finance violations.The elder Kushner would strike a plea deal and serve two years in prison, catapulting his son to the heights of power in the family's top-tier real estate development firm.Kushner's father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Chris Christie. Christie who later went on to become New Jersey governor also ran Trump's transition team until last week when the reins were handed over to incoming Vice President Mike Pence.Sources said this week that Kushner has been irritating some allies in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, including former Rep. Mike Rogers, who until Tuesday served as a national security adviser for Trump's transition.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/politics/donald-trump-jared-kushner/index.html"}
{"_id":"Who is Sam Galsworthy and why is he reinventing the Singapore Sling?","articleText":"CNN Travel series often carry sponsorships originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.Singapore (CNN)Some drinks just don't have staying power.When, for example, was the time you heard shouts of \"Another grasshopper over here!\" or \"Tom Collins and keep 'em coming!\" above the din of a crowded bar?Likewise, the appletini and Red Bull and vodka may require some explaining to future generations.The redoubtable Singapore Sling, however, is no such an ephemeral flake. The venerable gin-based cocktail said to have been invented at Raffles, Singapore in 1915 is marking its 100th anniversary this month ... with a new twist.The original recipe is lost but the current one given by Raffles head barman Aaron Manzanillo is: gin (30ml), cherry brandy (15ml), Cointreau (7.5ml), DOM Benedictine (7.5ml), Angostura bitters (Dash), grenadine (10ml), pineapple juice (120ml) and lime juice (15ml). Shake well and strain into glasses filled with ice. The key ingredient is gin.That's where Sam Galsworthy, the co-founder of Sipsmith artisan gin, comes in.MORE: Why Singapore may be the world's hottest cocktail cityThe Galsworthy connectionQuite by chance, Galsworthy visited the Raffles Hotel and requested a meeting with the food and beverage director the year before the drink's anniversary. Galsworthy happens to be a descendant of Sir Stamford Raffles, the British statesman who founded Singapore and after whom the hotel was named.\"I've always felt an emotional connection with Raffles because Sir Stamford Raffles was my great, great, great, great, great grandfather,\" says Galsworthy, whose first name is officially Stamford. \"When I mentioned this to Nigel Moore [Raffles' F&B director], I saw his face light up as I hoped it would. But I was blissfully unaware that 2015 would be the centenary of the Singapore Sling.\"The timing of Galsworthy's visit was serendipitous. \"We had started thinking about what we could do to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Singapore Sling,\" explains Diana Banks, Raffles vice president of brand and luxury sales. \"It had to have elements of both the old and the new and we thought that a bespoke gin would be an excellent way to do this, but had not thought of a partner we could work with.\"\"I had heard about Sipsmith and their growing reputation for catalyzing the revival of gin culture in London. They share so many of the attributes that Raffles has.\"MORE: 11 best new restaurants in SingaporeAuthentic methodsWhen it launched in 2009, Sipsmith was the first new copper gin distillery in London to open in 200 years. As well as producing its spirits in copper stills -- the company's three stills are nicknamed Prudence, Constance and Patience -- Sipsmith uses a \"one shot\" process, in which no extra alcohol is added to stretch or dilute the gin.Originally, the Raffles team suggested creating a gin in a style similar to one available around in 1915. But the idea was quickly overruled by Sipsmith's master distiller. \"He said 'we certainly will not'!\" recalls Galsworthy. Turns out, 1915 wasn't a great year for gin. Spicy concoctionInstead, for its 2015 incarnation -- called Raffles 1915 -- Sipsmith incorporated spices and ingredients from Southeast Asia. The gin is inspired by the hotel's location but is also a nod to Sir Stamford, who developed Singapore as a port for the spice trade and who had an avid interest in botany. He even cultivated spices on Government Hill, now Fort Canning in Singapore.Six botanicals that would have gone into an original London gin, and that go into every Sipsmith bottle, form the base of Raffles 1915: juniper, coriander, orris root, angelica, cinnamon and lemon peel. On top of that Sipsmith has added pomelo, lemongrass, jasmine, nutmeg, mace and clove. After some 40 variations, the Sipsmith team whittled down its recipes to two. These were sent to Turkey, where Raffles Hotel brass were attending a conference, for the final sampling.\"It was the best part of the three days,\" says Simon Hirst, general manager of Raffles Singapore. \"There was one clear winner that had a unique freshness and brightness.\"READ: 50 reasons Singapore is the world's greatest cityThe 'Raffles 1915' ginBeginning in November, Raffles 1915 is available in Raffles outlets in Singapore and Paris. \"It will be used in Singapore Slings but it's not anchored to one specific drink,\" says Galsworthy. \"Gin is so versatile ... I love it on the rocks or in a martini.\" Galsworthy also suggests a garnish of one of the Southeast Asian ingredients such as lemongrass or pomelo. \"I love crushed jasmine flowers in it,\" he says. \"Whichever you choose will really bring that ingredient to the fore.\"By the end of the year the gin will be available in Raffles hotels in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh in Cambodia, and Beijing and Hainan in China. All remaining Raffles properties will take delivery in 2016. \"It's definitely a long haul product,\" says Hirst, nodding at Galsworthy. \"I think we have our own copper still?\"Galsworthy who confirms that, yes, \"Patience\" is exclusively dedicated to crafting Raffles 1915. \"It's one of those great opportunities where everything fell into place at the right time,\" says Hirst. \"This is a hotel that's built on stories and this is the latest one. \"It's a match made in Singapore.\"Gillian Rhys is a freelance lifestyle journalist based in Singapore.

{"_id":"Why Carter is wrong on State of Palestine","articleText":"Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of \"The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.\" Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Writing in the New York Times, former President Jimmy Carter this week called on President Barack Obama to join with 137 countries and recognize the State of Palestine. Arguing that the two-state solution is dying and that something must be done to keep hope alive, Carter wrote: \"I fear for the spirit of Camp David. We must not squander this chance.\"Yet having spent the better part of my adult professional life working to promote, facilitate and consummate negotiations between Arabs and Israelis, my advice is precisely the opposite of Mr. Carter's.  I completely understand the urgent desire on the part of American peacemakers to do something. And in the case of Mr. Carter, that passion is especially strong. Few Israelis and Egyptians I know would take issue with the fact that had it not been for the role played by the US, led by President Jimmy Carter -- building on Anwar Sadat's historic visit and Menachem Begin's strong response -- there would have been no Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979.President Obama had, for his part, an eight-year shot at resolving this issue. Yet while the two-state solution is indeed in peril, there's little he can do in the next couple of months that will change that. As hard as it may be to accept right now, a unilateral move might make matters worse. And the reality is that any initiative the United States proposes -- especially recognition of Palestinian statehood -- would anyway have a very real chance of being overturned or undermined by the next administration, which would leave the Obama legacy in tatters, while diminishing US credibility in the process. There are several reasons why that would be the case, but three stand out:First, any initiative undertaken during the presidential transition in the United States would need to address not just Palestinian needs, but those of Israelis, too. No administration I've ever served in took a unilateral, consequential step related to the peace process that didn't bear this fundamental principle in mind. Indeed, it was Mr. Carter's own sensitivity not just to Sadat's concerns but to Begin's that produced the peace treaty. And right now, it's hard to see any balanced package of steps on the peace process that would be accepted by both sides and that would create an enduring foundation on which to build. Potential steps such as a presidential speech or a UN Security Council resolution laying out the parameters for a two-state solution would certainly have contained elements that both sides liked but also disliked.Second, US recognition of Palestinian statehood would almost certainly buoy Palestinian hopes -- but alienate the Israeli government, while having little appreciable impact on the realization of Palestinian statehood. In fact, this kind of symbolic act would inevitably widen the gap between Israelis and Palestinians, while ultimately increasing frustration and the risk of more violence by raising Palestinian expectations without any conceivable promise of delivering. In response to any unilateral declaration, the Israelis -- already deeply committed to settlements -- would likely respond with steps of their own that go beyond what they are already doing, such as building heavily in east Jerusalem, moving forward on the controversial E-1 project and perhaps even annexing portions of the West Bank. Many argue that the situation on the ground can't get much worse. But even if that is the case (and anyone familiar with this conflict knows things can certainly get a lot worse) one still has to ask what the point of unilateral recognition would be if it didn't take both sides in a positive direction. As a one-off symbolic step, one unmoored from any negotiating process and not followed up by efforts to create some kind of breakthrough, such an initiative would be, at best, a key to an empty room. At worst, it could unlock a host of unpredictable -- and mostly negative -- consequences.Third, there's the politically inconvenient question of how such a step would be viewed by the incoming administration, which in a few short months will have the power to shape US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.Back in 1988, I participated in an effort by the United States to initiate a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization during the transition from the Reagan administration to George H. W. Bush. That effort was welcomed by the incoming administration. But imagine what a Republican-controlled Congress would do if the outgoing Obama administration tried to recognize the State of Palestine or fashion a new Security Council resolution. Not only would the incoming administration move to reverse any initiative, a Trump administration keen to distance itself from what President Obama had done would likely move to assuage Israeli concerns. As a result, not only would Obama's legacy be exposed as empty rhetoric, but the new administration might find itself with an uptick in tension and violence as Palestinians react to Israeli efforts to demonstrate that it, too, can take unilateral actions. President Carter had his shot at Arab-Israeli negotiations, and, with the help of Sadat and Begin, made the most of it. President Obama has now had his. In the last couple of months of his administration, he should let this issue rest. Instead, he should adopt the diplomatic equivalent of the Hippocratic oath and do no harm. Because right now there's not a whole lot of opportunity to do good.  Ultimately, the key to solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict does not rest in President Obama's hands, nor in those of his successor. It's the parties, stupid. And neither they nor the peace process are ready yet for prime time. ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/opinions/carter-call-recognizing-palestinian-statehood/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why Ghanaians have a lot riding on these elections","articleText":"Ouborr Kutando holds a Master of Public Policy degree with a specialty in Political and Economic Development from the Harvard Kennedy School, and a BA in Political Science from the University of Ghana. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)It's not hard to see why Ghana was a lodestar for economic migrants in the 1970s. The first African country to achieve independence -- on 6th March 1957 -- its relative economic and political stability drew immigrants from all over West Africa. Fast forward almost six decades, and a much different story is being told.Even with the discovery of oil reserves off Ghana's coast in 2007, the country still struggles with providing day-to-day services to its citizens today. Abysmally long waits for basic government services abound. Rolling blackouts called 'dumsor' plague the country, and have done so for the past five years despite repeated promises from President John Mahama to solve the issue. Corruption, once scoffed at as a Nigerian problem, is now seen as part and parcel of the government, and it has Ghanaians worried, with 76% stating that they felt corruption had increased in the country. Ghana's might be in the throes of experiencing its own lost decade. According to Mo Ibrahim Foundation's 2016 Ibrahim Index of African Governance, Ghana experienced the eighth largest deterioration in the Overall Governance category, noting that \"over the past decade, oil revenues accrued from the oil price boom between 2000 and 2013 have not been harnessed for the benefit of citizens.\"Let's rewind a bit. After independence Ghana went through a cycle of military and civilian leaders, that wreaked havoc on its economy, and only finally transitioned away from military rule in 1992 by electing Jerry Rawlings, the former military leader. Ghana's economy was caught in a debt trap—its expenses far outweighed its income and it was continually borrowing to meet its obligations. When John Kufuor was elected after Rawlings in 2000, he inherited a heavily indebted poor country. His administration restructured the government and its debts, negotiated debt forgiveness and by the time he left, the country was lower middle income nation and seemed to be on the path to success.John Atta Mills came into power in 2009, and the upward trend stalled. A 2010 public sector wage hike was supposed to help curtail growing corruption, it aggravated it instead. Cost of living is skyrocketing and an average Ghanaian pays more for power and water than they did eight years ago. The government seems to be trying to paper over the large cracks of the exposed corruption scandals, typified by sole-sourced, inflated public contracts and judgment debt payments.The wasteful spending has Ghana borrowing at an alarming rate, forcing it to run cap in hand to the IMF, the public and the international community. Debt repayments now make up 30% of the budget, the debt to GDP ratio is getting close to the 70 percent mark, and still Ghana has borrowed an additional $860 million since September 2016, about as much as their estimated yearly revenue earn from oil. With elections coming up on 7th December, it will be a referendum on the last decade, and the Ghanaian people are mulling over change versus continuity. The last eight years are not a record to be proud of, but Ghana's potential to get back on course is achievable in the right hands.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/africa/ghana-elections-kutando/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why India's train network is so deadly","articleText":" (CNN)India's deadliest rail accident since 2010 has once again pulled to the fore the issue of how the country's vast rail network is funded and maintained.At least 148 were killed in the early hours of Sunday morning when a packed train traveling from the central city of Indore to Patna in the north east went off the track.\"All of a sudden there was a massive jerk,\" said one survivor, Ravindra Pathak. \"Our heads collided with the roof of the carriage.\"In the wake of the accident, former Indian rail minister Dinesh Trivedi told CNN the Indian railway system needs a \"generation change.\" \"The present system has outlived its utility,\" Trivedi said. In the immediate aftermath, Modi said his thoughts were with the victims loved ones, and the government  announced aid packages for the families of the bereaved. Lifeline of a nation?Often called \"the lifeline of a nation,\" India's extensive rail network runs 12,000 trains a day and the full-length track could circle the globe over one and a half times.It carries more than 23 million passengers daily, the equivalent to moving the entire population of Australia, and connects 8,000 stations across the subcontinent.It's also one of the oldest train networks -- built roughly 163 years ago by the colonial British government -- and is chronically underfunded. The system is often criticized for being inefficient, overburdened and unsafe. \"The system is over stretched, overstressed and has a direct impact on the safety of the operations in running trains,\" says Debolina Kundu, associate professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs.She says that, to earn revenue, new trains are continuously being introduced, but proper care is not being taken to replace the \"over-aged\" rolling stock. And the problem isn't just with the trains themselves, but how the tracks are being maintained. \"Most of the bridges and culverts [tunnels] have outlived their lives and become weak.\"She told CNN that before introducing more trains and increasing the frequency of services, in her view, there should be a proper survey of \"the capacity of the infrastructure to bear the additional stress.\" \"Priorities of investment have to be made,\" she says. 5 stunning facts abut India's railwaysShocking numbersAccidents are all too common.According to data released by the National Crime Record Bureau, a staggering 27,581 people died in rail accidents in India 2014, many of whom perished after crossing the vast swathes of tracks that border communities, homes and villages.Local people regularly across the lines where it's most convenient and, even when there is a manned crossing, duck under the barriers. Experts argue there's a need for an education drive on where and how the population should cross the tracks safely, but the reality is, with so many people living so close to the tracks, they're facing an uphill battle.Comparatively, the percentage who die from derailments is relatively small.And while the number of train accidents seems high compared to other countries, there has been a steep drop in serious incidents since in the early 1990s.\"The number of consequential train accidents decreased from 530 during 1991-92 to 131 during 2011-12,\" says Kundu. \"The continuous reduction in the number of train accidents per million train kilometers is indicative of sustained improvement in safety performance,\" she stresses.'Under-investment'A major contributor to the system's financial woes are heavily subsidized fares, which the government has shied away from increasing.While these fares make the system accessible for millions of Indians that rely on it, the freight and goods network ends up subsidizing the passenger facilities, which experts argue leaves little left for maintenance. Japan and Google announced major investments last year, aiming towards India's first high-speed rail link and the introduction of Wi-fi hotspots across hundreds of stations.And in a White Paper issued in February last year, Indian Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu readily admitted the financial shortfall thus far.\"Indian Railways has suffered from considerable under-investment during the last years,\" he wrote. He acknowledged that customer satisfaction and technological improvements had suffered as a result. \"Investments in safety have also been insufficient,\" he added.As part of the budget in March, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government promised record investments aimed at improving safety, security and the quality of service. But the crash will serve as a blunt reminder of the challenges facing his government in their attempts to deliver on this pledge.\"Despite its problems, Indian Railways is not down and out,\" Prabhu optimistically wrote in his White Paper last year.\"Indian Railways is perched on a precipice but is capable of flying off and attaining great heights.\"CNN's Omar Khan contributed to this report ","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/asia/india-railway-system/index.html"}

{"_id":"Why Obama 'Hope' artist hates Trump...but won't draw Hillary","articleText":"Hong Kong (CNN)In 2008, Shepard Fairey's \"Hope\" -- the now iconic blue red poster depicting then presidential candidate Barack Obama -- went viral, becoming the defining image of his campaign. \"The poster changed graphic design history,\" says Carol A. Wells, the founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, who points to the many ways the image's styling has been replicated around the world. \"Many believe this poster inspired enough voters to give Obama the edge that he needed to win.\"Two election cycles later, Fairey's Orwellian take on Donald Trump -- open-mouthed and poised to rattle off conspiracy, insult, attack -- sits in stark contrast to \"Hope\".\"Trump is dangerous,\" Fairey tells CNN.\"He's a demagogue who's a bigot and is sexist. He really has no respect for a lot of different people, no experience in politics, and is pursuing the presidency out of his own ego rather than a desire to create the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\"As for Hillary Clinton, the 46-year-old artist says she's hard to \"pin down graphically\", and hasn't \"found her inspiring enough\" to illustrate.READ MORE: Capturing unguarded moments with Obama\"I haven't always agreed with her. I was really disappointed in her support of the Iraq war. But I think she's been on the right side of issues that I care about and we're faced with a choice I think is a very, very clear choice.\"\"I think Hillary Clinton is much better for the United States than Donald Trump.\"'Visual Disobedience'Fairey spoke to CNN in Hong Kong, where the artist has created three murals in the city and opened \"Visual Disobedience\", an exhibition of 300 of his works that will be on show throughout November.The show, presented by the Hong Kong Contemporary Art (HOCA) Foundation, is a survey of Fairey's career in stencils, rubyliths, prints, canvases and sculpture and centers on the theme of power and responsibility.Included in the exhibition are some of the artist's early works, like Fairey's first print made on paper -- a combination of a Jimi Hendrix album cover and the artist's famous Andre the Giant image -- that HOCA curator Lauren Every-Wortman says help to define his legacy.   A 2016 canvas portrait of Fairey's \"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\" sticker -- which grew out of a street art campaign in 1989 and went on to become part of Obey Giant -- also features. \"It has the layering and technique that he's developed over the years but with the original image that brought him to notoriety,\" explains Every-Wortman.The artist's guiding principle to \"question authority\" feels particularly relevant to Hong Kong's tense political climate, where many residents, particularly the young, hold aspirations for a future independent of China.Hong Kong's Brexit ambitions: Could city ever be independent from China?Every-Wortman says the show wasn't created to specifically comment on Hong Kong politics, but the universality of Fairey's message crosses borders.\"I think the beauty of Shepard's work is the political frustrations he tackles are ones that can affect any country and society,\" she says. \"What he criticizes in American politics can be equally applied to Chinese politics.\"  Early influences  For Fairey, good political art is a conversation starter, and he points to Andy Warhol's portrait of Nixon and Robbie Conal's work of Ronald Reagan, as strong examples. \"I think now everyone knows Nixon wasn't trustworthy, but this image that Warhol made caught him looking like he couldn't be trusted. And then beneath it said Vote McGovern. It's kind of a bit of irreverent art, and one of the earliest examples of a very high profile artist, doing something political.\"Fairey credits Conal's 1988 depiction of Reagan during Iran-Contra as a big influence to his career.\"I was a senior in high school at the time. It said contra above (the image of Reagan) and diction below. I thought it has got a sense of humor, it's saying something politically and the portrait of Reagan is a great painting, though it's unflattering.\"\"This encapsulates everything I care about.

{"_id":"Why Trump might not be so bad for China and Asia","articleText":"Shaun Rein is founder of the China Market Research Group (CMR) and author of \"The End of Cheap China\" and \"The End of Copycat China.\" CMR is a Shanghai based marketing firm that specializes in helping equity firms and companies looking to invest in China. The views expressed are his own. Shanghai (CNN)On Monday, Donald Trump indicated he would follow through on campaign trail promises to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, announcing plans to pull out of the controversial trade deal in his first 100 days in office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that without the US, the deal \"is meaningless.\" While trade is likely to dominate Trump's immediate relations with Asia, long-term strategic US interests are most challenged by a rising China that is increasingly staking out its interests in the South China Sea and Africa by setting up military bases and reclaiming islands. China has quickly moved to fill the vacuum left by unease over a Trump presidency -- Beijing is pushing for free trade agreements of its own and publicly rebuked Trump over climate change, the reality of which China knows only too well, awash as it is with crippling pollution. Sino-Trump relationsDuring the campaign, Trump demonized China over alleged currency manipulation and for stealing American jobs. To get tough on China he threatened to slap a 45% tariff on goods made there. However, contrary to the fears of many China's watchers who are put off by Trump, there are several reasons a Trump presidency might actually help US-China relations, lowering the risk of military tensions and buttressing US business interests. Because Trump is less concerned about diplomatic niceties, and doesn't appear to have an underlying strict foreign policy ideology, he can and should lobby for an end to protectionism in China. While Beijing seems to regard President Obama as a pushover, they won't be able to ignore a threatening and volatile Trump who fights for a fairer playing field for US firms. Free tradeProtectionism has always been a problem in China. US automakers like GM are forced to enter into joint ventures with state-owned enterprises rather than owning outright their production facilities. Banks and insurance companies like Citigroup are similarly hamstrung by regulations limiting ownership and business scope. For the internet sector, good luck trying to get into China -- websites from Facebook to Twitter to YouTube are all blocked in the name of national security. When China entered the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, protectionism was less of an issue when the market accounted for a relatively small proportion of the global economy and lumbering Chinese companies were playing catch up. But now, China is the world's second largest economy and has global champions like Huawei -- the world's largest producer of mobile phones -- or Wanda -- a real estate firm buying up Hollywood studios and cinemas -- that cannot be allowed unfettered access to the US market when American firms are left picking up scraps in China. Intellectual propertyTrump knows personally the problems of copyright and intellectual property (IP) in China, issues hurting US interests from companies as varied as New Balance to Microsoft. The President-elect recently won a case against a real estate services firm using the Trump name, he's going to have another one to deal with soon -- a Chinese firm is making Trump-branded toilets. China needs better IP protection enforcement so US firms feel comfortable selling their value-added products in the country without fear of them being stolen. Only a strong, vocal President, capable of threatening, cajoling and waving carrots to Beijing can open up market access to China. Beijing respects strength and runs circles around weakness, as it has done to the Obama administration. Military tensionsFor his part, Trump can offer Beijing an ideology based on reducing the US role as the world's policeman. He has already said Japan and other nations need to pay more for their own defense, and may reduce the number of troops the US has in South Korea and Japan. China is especially concerned by US troops in South Korea with a direct land path to China. The Korean War technically never ended, and Kim Jong-un's regime in North Korea appears likely to implode, making China worried it may wake up one day with US troops on its border. Imagine if China had tens of thousands of troops stationed in Mexico. By reducing troop numbers in South Korea, Trump can assure Beijing the US is not trying to contain China, and deescalate military tensions between the two powers without hurting US strategic interests in Asia. A Trump presidency is looked at with fear by many in the foreign policy establishment. The reality however, is that he may be able to cut through unsuccessful policies and chart a new course with China.

{"_id":"Why did Trump wait so long to reject the 'alt-right'?","articleText":"New York (CNN)Donald Trump has never been one to shy away from speaking -- or more accurately, tweeting -- his mind.But critics say it took him too long to publicly disavow a shockingly racist speech Saturday by a white nationalist leader whose rallying cry mirrored Adolf Hitler's.\"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,\" Richard Spencer shouted from the podium of the annual convention for his think-tank called The National Policy Institute. Spencer calls himself the founder of the \"alt-right\" movement, a label that's been applied to far-right extremists advocating for white nationalism.The scene, taking place less than a mile from the White House, was reminiscent of Nazi-era Germany, with several members of the audience cheering with the straight-arm Hitler salute.At times speaking in German, Spencer's 30-minute speech included the unmistakable marriage of Neo-Nazi hate and Trump's campaign slogan.\"It is only normal again when we are great again,\" Spencer said.A Trump transition spokesman released a short media statement Monday evening, but it took Trump until Tuesday to publicly disavow the group in his own words. And it came only when pressed in a meeting with New York Times reporters, editors and executives, \"Of course I disavow and condemn them,\" Trump said when asked about the group.But Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League, says Trump needed to do it sooner.\"There seems to be a pattern in the Trump administration of waiting until the last moment. And we just don't have the luxury for that. When there are Nazi salutes in D.C., it's important to condemn it at the moment,\" Segal said.Segal referred to Trump's weekend tweets criticizing the cast of the Broadway show \"Hamilton\" when Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended.\"If you have the time to tweet about the theater, you should have the time to tweet about a spate of hate crimes and Neo-Nazis in Washington D.C.,\" he said.Similar criticism was lobbed at Trump during the primaries when he hesitated before disavowing David Duke and the KKK on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper.\"I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacy,\" Trump told Tapper.Republican National Committee RNC communications director Sean Spicer came to Trump's defense in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\"When is it going to be enough?\" Spicer said. He added, \"He has said that he refutes that, that's not the kind of movement he wants the support or see energized by him. That's not the kind of people he wants to be associated with. I don't know how many more times Donald Trump can make his position clear, but he's been crystal-clear for a long time and over and over and over again with every tweet, utterance, you name it, Facebook post, he has to somehow respond to it. He has made his position clear. It's time that we accept that position and move on. That's not his focus.\"Criticism of BannonThe hiring of Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the Trump White House has only intensified the criticism of Trump on this issue.While Bannon once reportedly bragged to Mother Jones that his website, Breitbart.com, was the \"platform for the alt-right,\" he later told the Wall Street Journal that he has \"zero-tolerance\" for those anti-Semitic tones.Trump said Tuesday that \"Breitbart is just a publication. They're certainly much more conservative, but Breitbart is really a news organization that's become successful.\" Regarding Bannon, Trump said, \"I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right ... I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\" He later added: \"I think it's very hard on him. I think he's having a hard time with it. Because it's not him.\"Former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella told CNN the issue will continue to cause problems for Trump.\"(Bannon) has said, Breitbart is the alt-right platform, these are the people that they have played to, that they have tried to motivate to be the base of Donald Trump's election. And it's just going to be more of this.\"Spencer threatens to spread his messageSpencer's think tank used to be a small, obscure extremist group operating mostly on the Internet, but its new confidence is apparent. Spencer even told The Washington Post that he has plans to give speeches at college campuses in hopes of gaining more supporters.But Spencer's message is white supremacism, anti-Semitic, anti-immigration and neo-Nazi. He's been banned from parts of Europe for trying to organize there.\"America was until this past generation a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity,\" Spencer told the crowd. \"It is our creation, it is our inheritance and it belongs to us.\"Video of the event is so alarming, the national Holocaust museum in Washington wrote a letter in response, warning that \"The Holocaust did not begin with killing, it began with words,\" and comparing Spencer's words to Hitler's.At the Times meeting, Trump said he wanted to look into the reason why Spencer's group feels so energized by his campaign.\"It's not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why,\" he said. During the primary season, a self-described \"white advocate\" explained it to CNN, saying Trump's anti-immigrant campaign promises were appealing to their message.\"He is appealing to people who grew up in the United States and don't want to end their days in what turns out to be an outpost of Mexico or Vietnam or Guatemala or Haiti,\" Jared Taylor told CNN's Drew Griffin.The Southern Poverty Law Center put out a statement Tuesday saying it should be no surprise that Trump's campaign rhetoric has given people permission to say these things out loud.\"The reason he's energized the alt-right is simple: He's been playing its tune from the day he announced his campaign and called Mexican immigrants rapists. His proposal to ban Muslim immigration, his talk of mass deportations, his attacks on 'political correctness,' it's all been music to the ears of a movement that envisions a white America -- and that's exactly the America that the 'alt-right' wants to see.\"CNN's Adrienne Shih contributed to this report.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/politics/donald-trump-alt-right-waiting/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why do police shoot to kill?","articleText":" (CNN)From Ferguson and North Charleston to Tulsa and Charlotte, fatal police shootings seem to be happening with alarming regularity.Police officers sometimes must make split-second decisions, under pressure, about whether or not to fire their weapon. It's not an easy job. But some of those killed by police in recent years have been unarmed, sparking outrage in communities across the US and raising questions. Why did the police have to kill these people? Are there other ways to defuse a potentially dangerous situation without someone getting fatally shot? Such cries grew louder earlier this month after suspected New York and New Jersey bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami was wounded but captured alive during a shootout with police.To gain a better understanding of police officers' use of deadly force from their perspective, CNN interviewed Cedric Alexander, a nationally recognized policing expert and veteran police chief who was called in to review the Ferguson, Missouri, police department after the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Alexander is currently Chief of Police in suburban Atlanta's DeKalb County. Here's a condensed version of our conversation.Why don't police officers shoot to wound? Officers are trained to \"shoot to stop,\" which often results in a homicide, Alexander said. They aim for the center mass of a person's chest because it is the target they are most certain to hit and is most likely to take the suspect down. Even a skilled marksman would have difficulty hitting a suspect's arm or leg in a fast-moving situation. And a wounded suspect could still possibly shoot the officer or someone else.Why do officers fire so many shots?Most officers today carry semi-automatic pistols instead of revolvers. Two decades ago, officers were trained to fire one or two rounds from their revolvers and then assess whether they needed to keep shooting. But now officers are trained to assess the threat level while firing, which means the officer may pull the trigger multiple times before the suspect has fallen, Alexander said.Why don't officers pause while shooting to reassess the threat?An armed suspect may still be able to return fire if the officer pauses during shots, Alexander said. Because semi-automatic pistols carry many more rounds than six-shot revolvers, and magazines make for quick reloading, modern police doctrine stresses firing until law enforcement and the public are safe. Why don't police use Tasers instead?Legally, officers are only to fire when they feel their life, or someone else's life, is in danger. But different officers are going to perceive a threat differently. While all officers are encouraged to use non-lethal means to subdue a suspect if they deem it feasible, they may use deadly force if they believe they are in imminent threat of harm. That might be a tough sell in the Tulsa case where the man who was shot had his hands in the air -- and the officer has been charged with manslaughter -- but an easier one in the Charlotte case, where the suspect appeared to be holding a gun and refusing to drop it, Alexander said. [The family disputes that he had a gun.]Tasers have a reach of nearly 35 feet, which lets police use them to immobilize people within the same distance as many armed confrontations. But their effective and safe use requires \"a great deal of training\" that many departments don't provide, according to National Police Training, a training website for law enforcement.There are also concerns that Tasers are occasionally misused or overused by officers, sometimes with fatal consequences, the website says.(David Klinger, a nationally recognized policing expert at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, argues officers should only use a Taser if they believe it can prevent a situation from escalating to deadly force. Klinger also contends that Tasers should only be used in cases where a second officer can provide \"lethal coverage\" in case the Taser doesn't stop the suspect.)CNN's Brandon Griggs and Eliott McLaughlin contributed to this story","articleCategory":["us"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/09/28/us/why-police-shoot-to-kill/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why extreme weather is the new normal","articleText":" (CNN)If it feels like it hasn't rained in months in the South, you're right. The region is experiencing an extreme drought. But just a few months earlier, we were talking about record-breaking floods in the South. These shocking extremes are happening more often, and it is all part of an unfortunate new normal in a world with climate change.As global temperatures continue to warm, we will also see a shift in day-to-day weather events. Most climatologists agree that calling it global warming was a mistake; climate change deniers will point at an extreme snow storm, like the New York blizzard of 2016, and sarcastically ask, \"Where is global warming now?\"But global warming doesn't mean people around the world will no longer receive cold weather and snow. It is true that we could see a decrease in the number of cold-weather events, but the ones we will have could be more extreme. For example, more high-temperature records were broken over the past four decades in the United States than low-temperature records, according to a study published in 2009. What is certain is warmer, even record-breaking, global temperatures will cause an increase in droughts and heavy rains all across the world.  Dire droughts A drought is one of the less surprising impacts of climate change, and the effects can be devastating to crops and livestock. With increased temperatures, there is increased evaporation, leaving some areas abnormally parched.While a lack of rainfall is a problem, the bigger issue is that the length of time between rain events is increasing. The Southeast is experiencing its worst drought since 2007-2008. Birmingham, Alabama, hasn't seen rain since mid-September. Atlanta has gone 42 consecutive days without rain, which broke the record for the longest stretch of days without precipitation.Atlanta has received only 2% of the city's usual average rainfall in the past 60 days. But Atlanta is expected to have more rain in the next two days than the city has gotten since September 2.Weather is nature's way of trying to create balance. Cooler air moves from the Arctic to mix with warmer air from the tropics to create an equilibrium. But instead, it creates a pendulum of weather events moving. Climate change is causing that pendulum to swing harder and faster. Atlanta's 2007-2008 record-breaking drought was followed in 2009 by one of the most massive floods the city had ever seen. Atlanta received more than 15 inches of rain in 18 hours. Flooding flourishesJust as we have seen an increase in droughts, we have also seen a rise in floods. Four studies have concluded that water vapor in the atmosphere is increasing globally. This happens because warmer air results in more evaporation, and evaporation leads to more available water vapor to create precipitation. That could be why we are seeing more floods. Flooding in Louisiana in August was the worst disaster to hit the United States since Superstorm Sandy. In one week, 6.9 trillion gallons of rain fell, and it wasn't even a named storm or a hurricane. It was simply a slow-moving system that stalled over Louisiana, dumping way more rain than the soil could soak up. Watson, Louisiana, had 31.39 inches of rain during the storm. Nearby Baton Rouge received \"only\" a little over 19 inches. According to the US Geological Survey, six stream gauges set records and 50 stations were overtopped by floodwaters.  Hurricane damage and forest firesNamed storms are known for their ability to soak and devastate. Indeed, there are still towns in the eastern half of North Carolina that look like Hurricane Matthew just hit. In some areas, the floodwaters still haven't receded from the record-breaking rainfall caused by the storm, which hit the state in October. Hurricane Matthew even dumped torrential rains far inland. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, about 80 miles from the coast, 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours. This shattered the 3.4-inch record set in 1996.However, Western North Carolina is suffering from the opposite problem. It is struggling with extreme drought conditions as wildfires continue to burn. Asheville, North Carolina, hasn't had rain since October 21, and then it was only one-hundredth of an inch. Nearly 20 large wildfires are still burning in the national forests of North Carolina.Climate change is not about one place affected. It's about the impact on the overall weather pattern. We are all going to continue to see extremes. The only question will be how extreme and how will we prepare.

{"_id":"Why fake news stories thrive online","articleText":"Judith Donath is a Harvard Berkman Faculty Fellow and formerly director of the MIT Media Lab's Sociable Media Group. She is the author of The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online (MIT Press, 2014). The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)Fake news stories proliferated in this heated election cycle. \"Terrorists are funding 20% of Hillary's campaign.\"\"Obama told illegal immigrants to vote.\" \"Tim Kaine will ban the Catholic Church from the US if they don't change their stance on same sex marriage.\"And while the election has come and gone, fake news stories continue to proliferate on social media. Indeed, they are often shared more than real news is.  Fake news is harmful. Many untrue stories are believed by the people who post them.  Sometimes a story that was intended as satire circulates as fact. Others are deliberately deceptive. A report in the Denver Guardian headlined \"FBI Agent Behind Clinton Email Leaks Found Dead in Murder-Suicide\" was shared widely on Facebook, with comments such as \"The Clinton Crime Syndicate has more lies and blood on their hands than any previous gangster in history.\" This wholly fabricated story appeared on November 5, a few days before the election.  (This story, along with the rest of the Denver Guardian, has disappeared in the aftermath of recent scrutiny of fake news. ) As Martin Baron, the executive editor of the Washington Post. said, \"If you have a society where people can't agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?\"  Combating the spread of false stories is important but difficult. The obvious solution -- fact-checking -- is ineffective: Many fake news consumers are suspicious of mainstream media and dismiss as partisan and deceptive any statistics or evidence that counter their beliefs. Worse, as we'll discuss below, demonstrating the factual flaws in a story can actually increase its social value. To discourage the spread of fake news, we need to better understand why sharing these stories is so appealing.Partisanship is part of it. People like and share news that conforms to their existing beliefs, and fake news stories are often strongly biased. Of course, people also share real news when it agrees with their views. One would think that given a real news story or a fake one, both conforming to one's beliefs, that the real news would be preferable. But fake news thrives online, frequently surpassing real news in its reach.  Recognizing the social function of news sharing is the key to understanding this seeming irrational behavior. In the world of social media, of Facebook and Twitter, news is shared not just to inform or even to persuade. It is used as a marker of identity, a way to proclaim your affinity with a particular community.For better or worse, we humans have a fundamental tendency to divide into groups. We bond with our own in-group and set ourselves apart from the others. Face to face, we signal this social identity in the clothes we wear, the foods we eat and more. But in the online world of information, material markers count for less. Instead, news sharing has become a prominent identity signal: We proclaim our affiliations by posting links to articles that reflect our groups' taste and beliefs.  Legitimate stories can, of course, serve this role. But for the purpose of marking social identity, fake stories can be even more powerful. Posting any story, real or fake, that conforms to your community's viewpoint bolsters your ties with them. Even if it is false, you have still demonstrated your shared values. The key is the difference in how outsiders respond to your posting of a fake vs. real news story.  If the news is real, outsiders who recognize it as such may disagree with it, but posting it does not reflect badly on you, and it may provide a common ground for argument and discussion.If, however, the news you post is fake, outsiders are more likely to be outraged. If you stand by it tenaciously, they may call you a fool or a liar. This infuriated response makes posting fake news a convincing signal of your allegiance to your in-group. By demonstrating that you are willing to sacrifice your ties to and your reputation among the outsiders, you prove the authenticity of your commitment.Furthermore, stoking conflict with outsiders strengthens the in-group's cohesion. This, too, raises the status of the person who posts a hotly contested story, especially when tensions are high.These dynamics explain why fact checking can be counterproductive.  When a story that a community believes is proved fake by outsiders, belief in it becomes an article of faith, a litmus test of one's adherence to that community's idiosyncratic worldview. The two sides will perceive that they have no common ground or understanding of truth, and the story becomes an even more potent signal of identity and catalyst of discord. This is why when signaling identity is the reason for sharing news, fake news is hard to uproot. It proves the poster's commitment to the community by demonstrating willingness to sacrifice outside relationships.  Recognizing this helps us craft more productive responses:First, follow the now-old adage, \"Don't feed the trolls.\"  If someone posts a fake story, and you think they have simply been duped, certainly it is useful to point out the error with a more reliable source. Please do graciously. No one likes to be publicly humiliated.  Sometimes a private message is better.  But if you think the posting is really about proclaiming identity, ignore it.  Don't amplify its value by arguing. And if you must say something, here a private message is really better -- you can convey your disapproval without providing the public display of discord that just strengthens their signal.Second, help promote a culture that reveres veracity. Check your sources before you post anything. Support newspapers and other organizations that do good, reliable reporting.  Discourage people in your own community when they promote stories that feel good to you, but are, alas, untrue. Third, appreciate humor. Like fake news, jokes and satire are markers of identity -- funny to insiders, and often incomprehensible or offensive to outsiders. They may be tasteless, they may be divisive but unlike fake news, they are not an assault on truth.Information can bring people together or drive them apart. Sharing false information, or fake news, is divisive. It's about claiming a separate territory, with its own rules and logic. Sharing true information is, ideally, the opposite. It's about unifying people, not only rallying the ones who agree, but also persuading the ones who do not; it provides a common ground.Ultimately, to remove the appeal of fake news, people need to value debate and discussion.

Election Day was eight days ago, but Donald Trump's transition team has yet to contact the Pentagon, State Department or other federal agencies. And a move to purge some transition advisers and employees has further slowed the process of getting the incoming administration off the blocks.So-called landing teams, which President Barack Obama installed at federal agencies within days of the election for his own transition, had been expected to arrive in DC Monday. But Vice President-elect Pence's takeover of the team caused a cascade of delays.Trump denies inquiry about security clearance for kidsChristie had signed the official document -- a memorandum of understanding -- with the Obama administration to run the Trump transition, meaning a new copy was needed with Pence's signature. That paperwork didn't arrive until Tuesday evening, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said.Trump's team will announce the first teams -- for the Justice Department and national security agencies -- Thursday, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday night. Economic and domestic policy teams will be announced next week. But it was not immediately when those officials will actually arrive at agencies in Washington.The White House was still waiting Wednesday night on names from the transition of the individuals who will form the landing teams.\"Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration,\" Hoffine said.In addition to the names, the transition will need to certify the individuals are free of conflicts of interest and paperwork from the team members that they meet the criteria of the transition code of conduct. And transition officials going into the most sensitive agencies, like the national security community, will need a pre-clearance to go in, which requires an entry-level investigation, said David Eagles, director of the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonprofit dedicated to the smooth transfer of power and good governance. For less sensitive agencies, all that is required is a quick background check, similar to what the White House might conduct on anyone seeking entrance.The State Department and Pentagon have said on the record they have had no contact with any member of the transition staff. Many of the remaining civilian agencies have said on background that they have not or have referred CNN to the White House statement from Hoffine. Pence's move to clean house in the transition team, removing selected lobbyists, people who have breached protocol, not lived up to standards or leaked information to the outside world, is also slowing things up. Several individuals who were leading agency teams according to an internal organizational chart obtained prior to the shakeup have been registered lobbyists, meaning new individuals will have to be identified.Trump's team says things are going well. \"We're going to get the transition team where we need it to be,\" spokesman Jason Miller told reporters in Trump Tower on Wednesday. \"It's going to be a team that will be able to put in place the exact type of team that President-elect Trump wants to have in.\"Trump tweeted Tuesday night that the process is \"organized.\"Who's in, who's out?Given the new ban on lobbyists Pence announced Tuesday -- a term the Trump team has not defined -- K Street -- the hub of lobbying in Washington -- is trying to determine who's in and who's out.Some sources on K Street were under the impression that the lobbying ban only applied to the landing teams -- staffers assigned to join transition offices in each federal agency to begin learning the ropes and preparing for a handoff -- and not policy staffers.Trump and Pence's offices did not respond to questions about the transition team lobbyist ban.What is clear is that some aides who were a key part of the effort are out.Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who was leading national security, was asked to leave the transition, and it was not clear who would replace him. Two people working with Rogers were also out: Matthew Freedman, a former DIA innovation adviser and former Bush transition official, was focused on the National Security Council, and Kevin O'Connor, a former Bush administration official at the Department of Justice, was working on DOJ. Freedman was fired in part for using his company's email address to make foreign contacts on behalf of the Trump transition, a source familiar said. O'Connor was said to be pushed out for his connections to the old transition leadership. Energy lobbyist Mike McKenna, who had been tasked with the Energy Department was also out over leaks, according to a source. According to a review of the chart, at least six other agency leads have been a lobbyist, and more have had ties to lobbying businesses. On the policy side of the transition, a review of the chart shows that eight out of 17 names listed have been registered lobbyists at one time.It's unclear what definition or timeframe the transition will use. A document dated November 10 apparently from the transition obtained by Politico required transition staffers to pledge they would not work on any transition area \"if I have engaged in regulated lobbying activities with respect to such matter, as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act, within the previous 12 months.\"Who could be in Trump's CabinetThat alone would disqualify several of the staff on the organizational chart, including some who were leading agency teams. Trump has also pledged to introduce ethics reforms that would expand the definition of lobbying to cut down on the revolving door in Washington, but it's unclear whether that would apply to his transition.Foreign governments struggling to reach TrumpThe confusion extends outside the US. One close US ally had to reach out to multiple contacts in the Trump world before successfully arranging a phone call between the President-elect and their head of state, a diplomatic source told CNN. The call finally took place a full day after his victory and after Trump had spoken to other leaders. This diplomatic source said the delay did not spark anger as much as confusion as to how to establish contact with the incoming president.The State Department has not heard from the transition to coordinate at all, State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday.Trump's transition released a list of 29 foreign or international leaders that they said the President-elect and Vice President-elect have spoken with. However, that list did not specify if all the leaders spoke with both men, or some only spoke with Trump or Pence.Frank Gaffney says he's not on Trump's teamOne person says he's definitively not on the team. Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist, denied a media report that he had been named to Trump's transition crew.\"An unattributed quote appeared in the press yesterday indicating that I had been appointed to the Trump transition team,\" Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, said in a statement. \"In fact, I had not been contacted by anyone from the team and appreciate the campaign's clarification today that the previous day's reports were inaccurate. I look forward to helping the President-elect and the national security-minded team he is assembling in whatever way I can.\"The Southern Poverty Law Center called Gaffney \"one of America's most notorious Islamophobes.\" Gaffney in 2009 suggested that Barack Obama had become \"America's first Muslim president.\"CNN's Tom LoBianco, Elise Labott, Daniella Diaz, Ashley Killough and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.

{"_id":"Why it's so hard to kick your sugar habit ","articleText":" (CNN)It seems like we're always being told to cut down on sugar -- but for many of us, that's easier said than done.Sugar is hard to avoid, even for people who don't consider themselves to have a sweet tooth. Even if you ignore the copious amount present where we expect to find it, like in a soda, sugar is hiding in many of our foods -- even those that aren't especially sweet. According to says Lisa Drayer, nutritionist and author of \"The Beauty Diet,\" some breads can contain six grams of sugar per slice. Some pasta sauces may contain up to 12 grams of sugar per serving, and some low fat salad dressings, which people might associate with healthy eating, can contain 10 grams of sugar per serving.  \"I think a lot of people think that just because something is natural, it's healthy,\" says Drayer. \"So for example, honey is natural, but it's very caloric and a lot of people might not know that a teaspoon of honey, or agave for that matter, has more calories than a teaspoon of sugar or sucrose.\"Good sugar, bad sugarComplicating matters, scientists view some sugars as worse than others. Natural sugars are found in foods like fruit and milk, in the form of fructose and lactose. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no reported evidence of adverse effects from eating these sugars, and fruits and vegetables also contain vitamins, minerals and fiber.Added sugars, on the other hand, are included during processing or preparation of food and drinks. These provide no nutritional benefits and can contribute to weight gain and obesity. This can lead to serious problems.\"We've seen an increase in risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, simply by consuming just one to two sugar-sweetened beverages each day,\" says Drayer.The WHO recommends adults and children reduce their intake of added sugars to less than 10% of their daily energy intake -- and says that reducing it to below 5% is even better. Although national sugar intake guidelines vary by country, the American Heart Association's daily recommendations for consumption of added sugar are a maximum of 24 grams a day for women and 36 grams for men. However, in the USA, the average adult consumes an enormous 88 grams of sugar a day.  Kicking the habitBut it's not just \"hidden\" sugar that's a problem. Another reason why it's so hard to cut down on sugar is that we simply love to eat it. While it's not known if sugar is actually addictive, some research shows it fires off the same reward centers in the brain as cocaine.\"It seems to induce cravings and hunger that are comparable in magnitude to addictive drugs,\" says Drayer.  A common indicator of addiction is if a person suffers from a loss of control. Drayer explains: \"If a person is obsessing about how he or she will get their sugar fix, and they simply can't focus on anything else, and they have a psychological dependence, then I think you're probably talking about a food addiction.\"So how can we regulate our sugar intake?  Drayer has a few tips: \"Look at the ingredients list,\" she says. \"If sugar or any one of the following terms are listed high on the label, you want to avoid that food: corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, agave, honey, molasses, and anything ending in 'ose'; dextrose, fructose and sucrose are all code words for sugar.\" Managing sugar also means managing other aspects of your diet, including portion sizes. \"Gradually cut back [on sugar] and consume more protein and fiber-rich foods,\" says Drayer. \"It can actually help curb sugar cravings as well. When we consume protein and fiber, it slows the rise in blood sugar if we consume it with a sugar-containing food. It can help satisfy us and help us reduce our sugar intake as well.\"So cutting down on sugar is not impossible. But, like other aspects of dieting and nutrition, it requires a conscious effort to manage.  ","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2015/12/10/health/sugar-habit-food/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why people believe conspiracy theories like 'pizza gate'","articleText":" (CNN)Fake news stories emerged with jarring force during the 2016 presidential campaign, and in a dangerous episode this weekend the potency of this deceptive new way of packaging and spreading conspiracy theories showed its continued influence.When Washington police said Sunday night that a 28-year-old man, who allegedly walked into a local pizzeria hours earlier with an assault rifle in hand, told officers he traveled from North Carolina to conduct an informal probe of something called \"pizza gate,\" expressions of shock and worry mixed in with knowing shrugs.The flourishes of the conspiracy theory pursued by Edgar Maddison Welch, a bogus and convoluted tale that casts Hillary Clinton and other top Democrats as the leaders of a child sex ring, are no more or less profane than so many others bouncing around the internet's seedier corners. 'Pizzagate': Comet Ping Pong not the only D.C. business enduring a nightmareBut the work of disentangling reality from a web of distortions dressed up as fact has become a persistent struggle for large segments of the population.\"People are constantly bombarded with information from so many different sources and it isn't always easy to work out what is true and what is false, and which sources are credible and which are not,\" Karen Douglas, a professor of social psychology at the University of Kent in the UK told CNN.Here's why the conspiracies are spreading:What separates Welch and others spreading the theories online is not the craziness of their ideas, but how relatively common they are. Americans of all political stripes believe in conspiracy theories. And their most typical identifying trait, according to experts in psychology and media, is a desire to be deceived.\"Tens of millions of people believe in conspiracy theories,\" Dartmouth political science professor Brendan Nyhan told CNN. \"There's a group of people that believe in a lot of them, but there's a much broader group that is willing to endorse them in certain cases. It's not a reflection of mental illness or pathology. It's a common thing that otherwise smart and well-informed people do.\"Fake news, real violence: 'Pizzagate' and the consequences of an Internet echo chamberWhat has changed, though, since the heyday of the John Birch Society in the 1960s, is the rate of proliferation and speed at which the dark whispers turn to public pronouncements.\"Someone like Alex Jones (of the Infowars website) can amplify the most effective conspiracy theories and spread them to a large audience,\" Nyhan said. \"Sean Hannity, too. We've seen memes jump from the fever swamp online to Hannity and Alex Jones and even Donald Trump's Twitter feed very quickly -- people like that can harvest the conspiracy theories that they think are most interesting or entertaining or shocking.\"Preying on weakness and creating the 'other'The most prominent channels may change over the decades, but the insidious nature of the misinformation spreading these days is not fundamentally different from the lies peddled a half-century ago.\"You're giving power to people who are feeling powerless,\" said Bob Goldberg, a history professor at the University of Utah and director of its Tanner Humanities Center. \"It's an antidote to powerlessness because giving the responsibility, pointing the finger, targeting someone gives people a sense that they know what's happening.\"Conspiracy theories tend to spring from those two prominent desires -- creating a feeling of control where it doesn't exist and defining an enemy where it is absent or difficult to define. In the former group, we find the 9/11 \"truthers,\" who falsely maintain that the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington were planned and executed by the US government, and the Sandy Hook \"hoaxers,\" who believe that the December 2012 murders of 20 young students and six teachers never happened. Both forged their stories in the crucible of horrific, paradigm-shifting disasters. Their distortions offered a reprieve to people overwhelmed by a perceived loss of control. And in targeting the victims, they have created -- at an unfathomable moral price -- a place to direct their rage. Abbey Clements, who was working as a second grade teacher at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut, when the shooting happened, has along with her colleagues and the victims' families been targeted by \"hoaxers\" with a range of goals -- some, she said, rooted in old political debates.  \"Besides being bullying and hurtful, these conspiracy theories are just distractions and through all of this they are really trying to silence the victims and survivors of horrendous tragedies,\" Clements told CNN. \"So people are not speaking out when they could be and trying to show what is really going on here, whether it's gun violence or something else.\"In the case of \"pizza gate,\" the invention offered a way for individuals with a searing dislike for Clinton and her allies to eschew any idea of reasonable disagreement -- and replace, as Goldberg said, \"your enemy and create the 'other.'\"\"The person that is against you is not simply wrong -- doesn't have a different opinion and they can be changed -- the person who is opposed to you is somebody who has committed treason, someone who has betrayed the country,\" he said. \"That puts them in a different sphere -- that's somebody who needs to be punished.\"Easy to believe, hard to explainAs they have played out on larger stages during the past two years, the anatomy of the conspiracy theory has become more familiar to even casual observers of media and politics. Like a virus, they come about simply and move rapidly, but can prove maddening or impossible to destroy. \"These stories are intricate and complicated -- far more so than reality or official explanations,\" University of Miami political science professor Joseph Uscinski told CNN. \"People have a world view and when something happens, something is laid over that worldview. So when a Republican heard that (Supreme Court Justice) Antonin Scalia died, it isn't that difficult to feel that sense of loss knowing you're about to lose an institution to the other side and say, 'Obama must have killed him!'\" -- even though that's false. Just the facts?The utility of fact-checkers in that environment can be difficult to predict. Ten years ago, Nyhan and a colleague presented a study on the effects corrected misinformation in news stories has on the people who consume them. Their findings were inconclusive and suggested that, in some cases, certain personalities would exhibit what they called a \"backfire effect,\" and dig in deeper to their initial positions. \"Fact checking is vital but it's not always as effective as we like. It's the best response we have -- when appropriate,\" Nyhan told CNN. \"But we should at least be circumspect about the idea that fact checking can counter the effects of misinformation especially with conspiracy theories because they're inherently unfalsifiable.\" The logical tangle was on display just hours after the Sunday afternoon incident. Michael G. Flynn, the son of incoming national security adviser Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, sought to defend the conspiracy theory with a perfectly impenetrable logical fallacy. He tweeted: \"Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.\"","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/pizza-gate-conspiracy-theories-why-believe/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why protecting steel workers from China's imports doesn't help America","articleText":"Jeffrey Miron is the director of economic studies at the Cato Institute and the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University. All views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump blamed the declining labor market prospects of American manufacturing workers on foreign trade, especially from China.  As a matter of electoral strategy, Trump's position seems to have been astute; recent evidence finds that the President-elect fared well in locations heavily impacted by trade with China. For example, the US steel industry, long-centered in Pennsylvania, has declined over the past several decades as imports of Chinese steel have soared; and Pennsylvania voters gave Trump a crucial unexpected victory November 8.As a basis for economic policy, however, the President-elect's perspective on trade is misguided. While import competition for a particular sector indeed harms the workers in that sector, focusing on these workers misses crucial, larger issues.To begin, importing cheap Chinese steel means lower prices for all US goods produced with steel, so consumers throughout the economy benefit. Further, since steel is an intermediate good used in the construction and manufacturing industries, importing Chinese steel helps expand these industries and thus aids the workers in those sectors. Any attempt to protect American steel workers from foreign competition thus harms both American consumers and American workers in other industries.And even though trade in steel harms domestic steel workers, trade in food, clothing, cell phones, computers, cars, and more benefits these very same steel workers as consumers of these other products. Similarly, trade in cars from Japan harms US  autoworkers, and trade in tomatoes from Mexico harms US agricultural workers. Yet all these workers benefit as consumers from free trade in every sector outside their own. Free trade expands the economic pie; interference with trade shrinks that pie.Nothing guarantees that every worker is on net better off due to free trade; the net impact depends on which goods a given person buys, how much foreign competition exists, and so on. But the net harm from trade is far lower for workers in every sector than is implied by considering only trade's impact on that sector. And overall, workers as consumers benefit greatly from free trade due to lower prices for a vast range of goods and services.The question is, then, whether policy should nevertheless try to even out the remaining gains and losses from trade by protecting those industries where workers are particularly hard hit. The answer is no.Protection aimed at a specific country or product will unleash demands for protection more broadly: once steel and other manufacturing workers have protections against Chinese competition, similar demands from, and protections for, every other trade sector become almost inevitable. If this occurs, free trade disappears, and everyone loses out by paying more for import-competing goods and services (even though a few gain from higher wages due to protection in their sector).Protection for domestic industries, whether narrow or broad, also risks retaliation from other countries against US exports. This happened in the 1930s after the Smoot-Hawley Act raised tariffs for thousands of products to near record levels. Numerous countries raised their tariffs in response, and worldwide trade shrank dramatically. The adverse impact of other countries' tariffs on US exports can easily swamp any benefit of US protection for its own industries.The fact that workers in trade-competing industries can lose their jobs or suffer lower wages is unfortunate but inevitable; just as importantly, policies that interfere with the adjustment of an economy to changing technologies and comparative advantages will condemn itself to a lower standard of living that benefits no one.In this sense, accepting the gains and losses that arise from foreign competition is no different than accepting the gains and losses that arise from domestic competition: in both cases, policies that attempt to avoid these losses generate even worse costs for the economy.  Operating a social safety net that softens the blow for displaced workers is a reasoned response; it helps those who lose from competition, while allowing the gains from new technology and competition to flow broadly.  Interference with free trade does little to help the losers from competition while imposing serious costs on everyone.","articleCategory":["politics"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/opinions/trump-trade-policy-misses-point-miron/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why we can't stop body-shaming","articleText":" (CNN)Showing a little flab? Enjoying the skin you're in? Good luck to you. These days, any sign of body imperfection, particularly being overweight, will bring down the wrath of society -- that is, the Internet. In recent weeks, comedian Amy Schumer, actor Wentworth Miller and model Iskra Lawrence have all faced digital scrutiny of their bodies -- but whether you're a celebrity or not, you may find yourself the victim of image-shaming.Renee Engeln, a Northwestern psychology professor and the director of the university's Body and Media Lab, notes that our image-heavy (pardon the pun) culture has brought out the critic in everybody.We've always cared about appearance, particularly for women, she says, but technology has made the focus stronger than ever.\"It's never been this intense, this relentless,\" she said. \"There have never been so many forums in which you can gaze at different images of women, evaluate them, comment on them (and) share them with your friends.\"And it's not just celebrities anymore, she adds. \"There used to be a class of people who had to worry all the time about how they looked, because it was their job,\" she said. \"Now we don't really have a front line between those people and everyone else.\" 'The F word'Our media culture loves thin.To look at movies, TV shows and photo spreads is to enter a world where there isn't an extra ounce to be found. Women show off impossibly sleek dresses and revealing bikinis; men wear slim-fit shirts and boast washboard abs. Reality shows make a virtue of weight loss; tabloids sneer at celebrities who have \"let themselves go.\" Want that to be you? Diets and exercise programs promise a healthier, fitter life in mere weeks -- sometimes days. Nobody wants \"love handles\" or \"bingo wings\"  or the dreaded \"belly pooch.\"  Indeed, \"fat\" is the word that dare not speak its name: Large women are \"plus-size\" or \"Rubenesque\" or \"zaftig\"; large men shop at the \"big and tall\" store. Author Jennifer Weiner called it \"the F word,\" \"this dreaded, stinging word.\"  And yet thin wasn't always in, as fashion and branding expert Rachel Weingarten points out, noting the large bellies and hips of ancient fertility goddesses and the fleshy models of the Old Masters (including, of course, Peter Paul Rubens).\"If you think about it in terms of history, the point was that people who had meat on them, that means they could afford food,\" she said. \"That was a status symbol.\"Today, says Engeln, status has gone the other direction. \"In countries that have a lot of stuff, it's not hard to gain weight. It's hard to stay thin. So being thin becomes a mark of status, because it means you can afford the gym or all that healthy organic food, and you live somewhere where it's safe to go out for a walk every night,\" she said. \"So thinness has really become a marker of status, and when things are associated with status, we want them.\"Tricks of technology And we don't want to be fat. The fat person is an easy target -- even for children.\"Fat hatred has become so pervasive that it is part of the fabric of our language and interactions,\" Robyn Silverman, author of \"Good Girls Don't Get Fat: How Weight Obsession is Messing Up Our Girls and How We Can Help Them Thrive Despite It,\" said in 2012. \"Fat and thin are no longer simply assessments of size or weight but rather of character. So you can imagine why adoption of these attitudes, diet talk and disordered behavior is happening earlier as well.\"  All this comes as Americans are getting bigger. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average adult American woman weighs 166 pounds.  That's up 25 pounds since 1960. (The average American man has gone from 166 to 196 in the same period.) \"An awful lot of us hate fat people, and the fatter we become, paradoxically, the more we hate them (us),\" Richard Conniff wrote in a Men's Health essay titled \"I Hate Fat People.\" Though nasty comments about looks are associated with Internet trolls, it can also play with our own minds -- particularly adolescents, says Engeln. In a selfie-loving society, it's not unusual for people to take dozens of pictures of themselves before posting just one image, she says, all to get that key social currency of \"likes\" and \"favorites.\"\"There's a series of consequences to thinking of yourself always in how you look to other people, and that's what a lot of this intense media focus has done,\" she said. Eating disorders are one effect of this thinking, she observes, but not the only one: it may also lead to depression and anxiety. Don't expect it to get better. Technology, particularly Photoshop and CGI, can perform tricks that would make a Mannerist painter chartreuse with envy.\"For the next generation of teenager, it's going to be hard not to hate yourself a lot more physically, because what we mirror to them is so godlike,\" director Nicolas Winding Refn told New York magazine recently, noting the prevalence of CGI body-tweaking in film. \"If you look at the greatest movie stars, we identify much more with imperfection than perfection.\" Engeln, who's 40, sees it in her students.\"I'm thankful every day that I did not grow up in the era of digital photography and social media,\" she said.Fighting back -- with empathyThere are certainly good reasons to lose weight. Obesity brings with it a risk for health disorders including diabetes, hypertension and sleep apnea. But nobody has ever had to be told that they're fat, says Engeln. \"If you're commenting on a stranger's appearance, it's not because you care about health,\" she said. \"You don't care about people's health by shaming them.\"So what can be done about the shaming trend? Some women are fighting back. Sewing blogger Jenny Rushmore started a trending hashtag after a commenter told her to \"eat less cake.\" And after YouTube comedian Nicole Arbour posted a routine mocking fat people, \"My Big Fat Fabulous Life\" star Whitney Way Thore responded with her own video.\"Fat-shaming is a thing; it's a really big thing, no pun intended,\" Thore said. \"It is the really nasty spawn of a larger parent problem called body-shaming, which I'm fairly certain everyone on the planet, especially women, has experienced.\"The next time you see a fat person, you don't know whether that person has a medical condition that caused them to gain weight,\" Thore added. \"You don't know their mother just died. You don't know if they're depressed or suicidal or if they just lost 100 pounds. You don't know.\"Indeed, though it's probably a kumbaya pipe dream, a little more empathy would probably do society a world of good -- especially in the age of selfies. \"Why does anyone have to be 'other'?\" asked Weingarten, the fashion expert. \"As a culture and as a society, it will never go away fully, but ... we should try not to be judgmental.\"That's what actress Melissa McCarthy, who has known her share of criticism over her size, said about the most recent imbroglios.  \"We have to stop categorizing and judging women based on their bodies,\" McCarthy wrote in an Instagram post. \"We are teaching young girls to strive for unattainable perfection instead of feeling healthy and happy in their own skin.\"Something worth considering, whatever your skin may hold.","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/health/fat-shaming-feat/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why women should make the first move in online dating","articleText":" (CNN)Women of late have been \"leaning in,\" graduating college at higher rates than men and simply \"running the world\" (if Beyonce is any measure), but there's at least one forum in which they're not taking charge: online dating.A recent OkCupid study found men are more likely to send the first message on the dating website than women. This trend was shared among women of all ages, who have sent a median of three to four first messages. Men, on the other hand, send a median of nine to 15 first messages, depending on their age.OkCupid Chief Product Officer Jimena Almendares said the company was surprised by the research project's results.\"There was clearly a unique opportunity specifically for women on OkCupid when it came to messaging first,\" she said.Stacy Kaiser, \"Live Happy\" editor-at-large and licensed psychotherapist,  said many women still hold onto old-fashioned dating traditions like relying on men to make the first move.\"Fear and rejection are feelings that go along with that,\" Kaiser said.These findings contrast with the idea that young women are part of a hookup culture that has reached its apex with the advent of dating apps like Tinder. Granted, swiping right as a sign of approval to (hopefully) get a match doesn't take much heavy lifting. Sending the first message, on the other hand, seems to be perceived as men's work. A quick perusal of Twitter shows that while some women advocate for making the first move, others shy away from it.\"Why do women have to make the first move? To a certain extent that's not the woman's job -- in terms of chivalry (which this generation lacks)\" wrote one woman.\"Ladies if you want a certain man go get them... Who cares if women aren't suppose to make the first move, go get what you want,\" another countered.When online dating, a woman can increase her chance of going on a date with a man who is attractive to her by sending the first message, according to the dating site's findings. Almendares said OkCupid analyzed the attractiveness of all the men who women had a conversation with after they sent the first message, and the median attractiveness of those men was 6.6 percentile points above the attractiveness of the women sending the message. The site measured attractiveness as having nice looks, engaging photos and an intriguing profile.\"So even if women select the best from their inbox, it's likely they are settling and going on a date [with] someone less attractive,\" Almendares said. \"More importantly, because very few women message first, those that do stand out.\"The study found that the odds would be in favor of the brave woman who messages a guy first, because 30% of those messages turn into a conversation. Women are 2.5 times more likely to get a response than men if they initiate contact.Back to Twitter, where some guys complain about how much they wish women would take charge and make the first move.\"Sometimes women should make the first move. It adds a little excitement,\" wrote one user.\"Live Happy's\" Kaiser advises women to be casual when initiating a relationship and to not make \"a big buildup in your head or real life.\"\"For example, you don't need to call it 'a date' if he just wants to hang out or grab something quick. Also, it is always good to rope in a friend to help, or getting a group of people to go out, and then you can make sure you sit next to him, find time to flirt, et cetera,\" Kaiser says.Almendares said social norms are changing and women would gain more by seizing the moment.\"Ten years ago, online dating wasn't the norm, but today, it's the new normal. However, the one norm that has yet to change is who makes the first move. This is why women who shift this dynamic have such a big advantage.\"","articleCategory":["living"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/03/14/living/okcupid-womens-research-feat/index.html"}

People donated money to the family who claimed their daughter was kicked out of KFC because of her disfigured face. (An independent investigation later contradicted the family's story.) The Bey Hive bullied fashion designer Rachel Roy on social media because they were sure she was the \"Becky with the good hair,\" allegedly having an affair with Beyonce's husband, Jay Z. Then, of course some confused fans mistakenly turned on TV chef Rachael Ray, too. Even super smart people trust what their friends say on Facebook. A psychology graduate student at Dartmouth recently came to work all excited about a new breed of fruit he'd read about on Facebook. On the outside, it looked like a banana, but cut into it, and it's a juicy green kiwi. A professor, Luke Chang, told him there was no such thing as a crossbreed between a banana and a kiwi. If there were, wouldn't it be on supermarket shelves? Chang showed the student reports debunking the \"baniwi\" hoax. \"He said, 'I can't believe I fell for that!' But everyone else in the lab said, 'Don't worry, we fell for it, too,' \" said Chang, assistant professor of psychological and brain studies at Dartmouth. Mauricio Delgado, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University, says it's simply part of our nature as human beings to trust what other human beings say. \"Our brains are wired that way,\" Delgado said. Here are five reasons why our psyches are designed to trust our friends on Facebook and in real life, even when it doesn't necessarily make sense to do so. 1. Not trusting takes too many brain cells. Imagine if you woke up every morning questioning and doubting everything and everyone in your life: whether you can trust your spouse, for example, or if the guy who drives the bus you take to work has had too much to drink, or if the lady making your coffee has washed her hands. You'd be exhausted. \"That's not a very efficient way to navigate your life,\" said Emily Falk, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"We just don't have the bandwidth to do that.\" 2. If you don't trust other people, a bear might eat you.While we might not always recognize it in our modern world, there is indeed safety in numbers or, as Frank puts it, a \"survival advantage\" to being in a group. At a recent conference in the Canadian Rockies, economist Robert Frank and other attendees were advised not to go out on hikes alone because a bear might pounce. But go in a group of five or six people, and the bear would probably turn around and walk away. Falk, who's also director of the Communication Neuroscience Lab at the Annenberg School of Communication, has another example: If you're part of a group wandering in the forest, another member might warn you about a contaminated and potentially deadly water source that you wouldn't have known about on your own. \"People who succeed almost always succeed as trusted members of teams,\" said Frank, a professor of economics at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. \"If you're a lone wolf, that's not a good path to success in this world.\"3. Being a skeptic might get you kicked off the team. If you argue with your friends, even if you're right, you could end up getting kicked off that team -- and then you're alone and dinner for that bear. \"There are skeptics who question every little thing. We all know those types of people, and they can be really caustic and annoying,\" Chang said. \"The skeptic might be right, but at what cost?\" 4. Trusting someone gives your brain a warm glow.  Even Chang, who rightly questioned the \"baniwi,\" sometimes believes things he shouldn't. When he got a small burn in his kitchen, his mother told him to put egg whites on it. You might think the guy with the Ph.D. and the professorship at an Ivy League school would consult a first aid manual, but no -- he just slathered on those egg whites. \"Of course I did it, because I'll do anything my mom tells me,\" Chang said. But she was wrong (sorry, Mrs. Chang). Egg whites can contain salmonella, and you wouldn't want that on a burn. Chang didn't question his mom because over the course of his life, Chang's brain has learned that his mother loves him and wants what's best for him, and she's had a good track record of being right. Studies show that we like to trust other people. Scientists have asked study subjects to play games with a stranger and with a friend. The game is rigged so the subject is equally as successful with both partners, but on an MRI, the reward centers of the brain light up brighter when the subject has success with the friend. \"We feel a particularly warm glow when we play with a friend,\" Delgado said. And we have a hard time saying goodbye to that glow. Even when psychologists set the game so the trusted friend steals all the money, the study subject keeps investing with him. \"If someone betrays you, your system of thinking should adapt pretty quickly, but it doesn't,\" said Delgado, the Rutgers psychologist. 5. We love an 'attaboy' or 'attagirl' even more than money or food.Facebook friends love to tell us how wonderful we are. They admire our photos and never forget our birthdays. That's powerful stuff. In some studies, participants responded just as well  -- or even better -- to comments like \"you're great at this!\" as they did to rewards like food or money. \"There's a real importance to being social,\" Delgado said. \"It's always nice to have friends.\" ","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/health/facebook-friends-hoaxes/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why your child doesn't wear a seat belt on the school bus","articleText":" (CNN)Parents in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are mourning the deaths of at least five children whose lives were cut short when their school bus smashed into a tree and split apart on Monday.The 24-year-old driver, who police said has been cooperative and talking to investigators, has been arrested and charged with vehicular homicide.As the investigation continues, many people across the country are left with questions -- such as, could lives have been saved if the school bus were equipped with seat belts?There's no federal mandate that requires children to wear seat belts on school buses, and only six states -- New York, California, Florida, New Jersey, Louisiana and Texas (PDF) -- have laws requiring school buses to be equipped with seat belts for passengers.The American Academy of Pediatrics has long recommended that passenger seat belts be installed on newly manufactured school buses. The National Safety Council also has made similar recommendations, said Deborah Hersman, its president and CEO, on CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday morning.\"That's the best protection that we can give our kids. It's what they're used to in cars,\" Hersman said. \"We know that there are very few fatalities involving children on school buses every year -- they are a safe form of transportation -- but anything that we can do to make them safer is really our responsibility.\"'You have to follow the money'Some experts say that buses are already considered to be safe and that adding seat belts can be costly.Although nearly 500 children and teens die each year in car accidents during school travel hours, only about four are killed while riding school buses during those same hours, according to a 2014 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (PDF). The average incremental cost of equipping a large school bus with seat belts would be between $7,346 and $10,296, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated at a public meeting last year (PDF).\"A lot of it has to do with the communities that are responsible for replacing or buying those school buses,\" Hersman said. \"I do think that you have to follow the money. We're talking about a couple thousand dollars for each new bus that's purchased.\" Yet the NHTSA argues that the addition of three-point seat belts could help make school buses even safer, reducing the average number of lives lost annually in school bus crashes from four to two. In 2011, the Department of Transportation decided not to pursue a proposed rule requiring the installation of three-point seat belts on school buses nationwide, said Richard Williams, former director of the regulatory studies program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/health/school-bus-crash-seat-belts/index.html"}
{"_id":"Why your next statement purchase will come from Africa","articleText":" (CNN)There is a new international scramble for Africa happening but this time it is not for lucrative geographical territories but its modern art.Investment in the right pieces can see a 10-fold increase in their future value -- leading to a plethora of international galleries vying to represent its artists. While reports of Africa's growing middle class art collectors abound, of which there is, in reality 80 per cent of sales in African art still come from international collectors mainly in the US and UK. Something that art fairs such as 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair - which opened yesterday at London's Somerset House -- has capitalized on. Individual prices at last year's fair reached almost $70,000.When 1:54, named after the 54 countries that make up the African continent, launched three years ago, it did so to just one wing of the 16th century house. Today, the fair takes over the entire building, a testament to the show's increasing popularity. Fighting for controlHowever this year a quiet riot is taking place; Africa, no longer content with seeing its artists fronted by foreign galleries, is fighting for control. 17 galleries make their debut at 1:54 and a considerable number of them are based on the continent such as Gallery 1957 - which opened in Ghana earlier this year. Its Lebanese-born founder Marwan Zakhem, told CNN he wanted to give artists \"the option of not having to travel internationally and hook up with galleries around the world.\" Many artists struggling to get their artworks noticed, inevitably move to the US or Europe notes Zakhem. Gallery 1957 -- named after the country's year of independence, allows artists \"to be able to do their work within Ghana but have the platform to be able to take it internationally - I don't think a lot of artists have had that opportunity,\" he says. A closer relationshipThe gallery brings to 1:54, the works of Serge Attukwei Clottey, born and raised in Ghana's capital. For Clottey, being represented by an Accra based gallery means a closer relationship and bond. \"As an artist I just can't deal with this whole markets and everything, because I'm in my process I just want to do my art,\" says Clottey.  \"I just want to be in my studio and create my work, but, I believe getting to work with good galleries is quite important because then you can become less concerned with the politics of it.\" Clottey's works often deal with political and social issues in Ghana. His use of the yellow jerry cans used to carry water in Ghana, is recognizable. \"The plastic jerry cans for me has a very interesting journey coming from Europe and into Africa,\" he says.   Giving artists their own voiceAlso debuting at 1:54 is Ethiopia based Addis Fine Art, which opened its doors January 2016. \"We wanted to tap into the wider market so that our artists can get recognition and be commercially successful,\" its co-director Rakeb Sile told CNN. Of its white cube space in Addis Ababa, Sile notes they \"wanted it to be like when you walk walked into a New York [gallery], have that feel, that curatorial rigor.\" Amongst its five Ethiopian-born artists exhibiting, is Michael Tsegaye. The celebrated photographer has been highlighting the country's rapid industrialization - a contentious issue amongst locals. His Chasms of the Soul series looks at cemeteries that have been bulldozed over to make way for luxury buildings.\"He looks at how a lot of things that we used to know, they've been stripped away, with these new generalized cities emerging,\" says Sile. What's important, says Zakhem is the newer Africa based galleries allow artists to have their own voice, which is often missing on international platforms. A boost in local collectorsAudiences can now start to notice the large distinction between modern arts from Senegal versus that of Morocco. \"This whole African art thing I find it hard because it's such a large continent, to say that somebody's art that is coming from Labadi [Ghana's beach town], is the same as somebody that is coming from Zimbabwe - it's not,\" Zakhem says, with a noticeable frustration. It's also a way of increasing the number of local collectors. \"A lot of my collectors are based abroad and not in Ghana but just recently after my show with 1957 [which took place in Accra] a lot of Ghanaians have patronized the work,\" explains Clottey.For Africa's new galleries, sales are not flying through the door yet, admits Sile. \"But that's because people aren't used to buying from galleries within Ethiopia,\" she says, \"Because there isn't that many.\"A decline in international interest?Will the international interest in Africa's modern art abate? Not likely think experts. \"It would be too easy to think that this is just a trend,\" says Nadia Amor, director of Galerie d'art L'Atelier 21 - another newbie to 1:54. The luxury five-year-old gallery is based in Morocco, Casablanca. \"The rise of such interest for contemporary African art is most likely to be related to the deep and strong statements that African artists are making through their artistic productions, which are rooted in cultural, social, and political issues and phenomena that are altering the face of Africa,\" she says, \"making it one of the places where alternative gazes and thoughts are emerging.\" Amor adds: \"Even though it is a very competitive market, they [African artists] have a sharp sense for positioning themselves through the relevance of their works.\" 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair runs until 9 October, at Somerset House, London.

{"_id":"Wildfire smoke and your health: Do you need to worry?","articleText":" (CNN)Hazy, smoke-filled skies from wildfires blazing across the drought-impacted South are causing poor air quality and health concerns. This isn't just an issue for those living close to wildfires burning in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky. Winds have carried the smoke to cities miles away. In Atlanta, where there are no wildfires, the air quality level is \"unhealthy,\" which means \"everyone may begin to experience health effects and members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.\" The National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for most of South Carolina and Georgia, as well as parts of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. The fires continue to burn, and there is little hope for rain in the forecast. The arrival of La Niña in the Pacific Ocean also has a global impact that is predicted to cause drier and warmer weather this winter in the southern United States, according to NOAA. Some school systems, like Greenville County in South Carolina and Haywood County in North Carolina, are limiting outdoor physical activity. Students with respiratory conditions, those wishing to remain indoors during recess and athletes with outdoor practice are allowed to remain inside. But do people noticing smoke in the sky really need to worry?Although cooler fall temperatures may bring more appeal to outdoor activities, smoke exposure isn't worth the risk. Here is some advice for reducing your exposure risk and keeping yourself and your family safe. Why wildfire smoke makes you sick Wildfire smoke includes particles from burning vegetation and building materials mixed with gases. If your eyes feel like they're stinging, smoke exposure could also be inflicting other damage. Particles can be getting into your respiratory system. Exposure can cause chest pain, a fast heartbeat or wheezing or bring on an asthma attack. Besides coughing and trouble breathing, many people experience symptoms similar to a sinus infection, such as headaches, sore throat, a runny nose and even tiredness, according to the CDC. Wildfire smoke can be especially harmful to the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with chronic heart and lung diseases. Because children breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and their airways are still developing, they may experience more severe symptoms. Those with asthma or lung disease should consult their doctors about navigating situations like this. Some people may even experience illnesses like bronchitis due to the fine particles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.     Staying healthy when it's smokyIf you see a haze, smell smoke or know of a wildfire in your area or a place you plan to visit, check the Air Quality Index to see whether you need to limit your time outdoors. When advised to stay inside, keep your windows and doors closed. It's OK to keep the air conditioner running, but make sure the filter is clean, and close the fresh-air intake to prevent smoke from entering, according to the CDC.It's also important to keep indoor air clean by not burning candles, using the fireplace or gas stoves, or smoking. Running a vacuum can also keep particles circulating in the air. Dust masks actually trap large particles and don't protect your lungs from smoke inhalation, but a mask that uses a filtering respirator can offer some protection. The CDC also has tips for how effective different types of masks can be, depending on your exposure. Even if the air outside or in your home looks clear, it may not be free of harmful microscopic particles, especially if the wildfires and smoke persist for weeks.Pediatric pulmonologists at Children's Hospital Colorado's Breathing Institute also recommend changing your clothes if you've been outside, rinsing out red, irritated eyes and drinking fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Parents should seek emergency care for their children if they experience real difficulty breathing or a change in their level of consciousness.There is a low risk of long-term effects of wildfire smoke exposure for healthy individuals.

(CNN)The Hill national correspondent Reid Wilson said that just because Hillary Clinton failed to reassemble the Obama coalition enough to propel her to victory doesn't mean that diverse group of voters won't be enough to help the next Democratic candidate win. \"I think that there's a case to be made that the Obama coalition still exists,\" Wilson told CNN's \"Party People\" podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation. \"But it only serves Obama,\" Madden responded.\"It has so far only served Obama,\" Reid added. \"If you're the Republican party, though, do you really want to be betting that it will not serve somebody else down the road and just go ahead continue alienating African-Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women and basically everyone else who made up that core Obama vote. Sure, it didn't show up for (Clinton). That's not to say it won't show up in the next election.\" Wilson cited The Atlantic's Ron Brownstein's description of the groups supporting Obama as the \"Coalition of the Ascendant,\" though Wilson told Madden and Ham that that coalition \"hadn't ascended yet\" in regards to the 2016 electorate. Those changing demographics could however be in place as soon as the next election cycle. While that might not be good news for Republicans, Wilson sees plenty of work for Democrats to do in developing their political bench in time for the next election.\"Where is that bench? That bench lost in 2010 and 2014,\" Wilson said, citing years where Republicans had more luck stocking governor's mansions and state legislatures with more rising stars than Democrats. Wilson also warned that Trump is largely \"lightning in a bottle\" -- managing to take advantage of \"the dominant medium of the moment\" in order to win -- and warns political strategists not to think his strategy is necessarily repeatable. \"I think strategists on both sides are going to ... learn the wrong lessons now,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to come back and bite somebody in the you know what next time around and then hopefully they'll learn the right lessons.\"To hear what Wilson thinks those lessons are and his thoughts on Trump's first 100 days in office, listen to CNN's \"Party People\" podcast.Get CNN's \"Party People\" podcast at CNN, Stitcher, TuneInRadio or iTunes.

{"_id":"Winnie-the-Pooh gets a new friend","articleText":" (CNN)Winnie-the-Pooh, the fictional teddy bear loved by children worldwide, is celebrating his 90th anniversary with a new feathery friend. The character Penguin makes its first appearance in the book series' anniversary sequel, Winnie the Pooh: The Best Bear in All the World.The new sequel released by Egmont Publishing -- which jointly owns the rights to Winnie-the-Pooh with Disney -- will include four new tales each set against a season throughout the year. Pooh Bear's new friend is introduced to a new generation in Winter: In which Penguin arrives in the Forest, written by British author Brian Sibley. He drew inspiration for the character from an old photograph of the book's original creator, A.A. Milne, and his son playing with a penguin toy. \"While pondering what other toys Christopher Robin might have owned but which were never written about, I remembered seeing a photograph of father and son playing on the nursery floor with Winnie-the-Pooh and -- a penguin!\" Sibley said in a statement. \"The thought of Pooh encountering a penguin seemed no more outlandish than his meeting a kangaroo and a tiger.\"The beloved bear has been making friends since 1926, when the first story was published. The sequel's illustrator, Mark Burgess, told CNN that the hardest part in designing Penguin was making sure the character resembled the stuffed toy from the old photograph. \"I had to try to combine a 'toy' look while also making the character look alive. It's quite a difficult balancing act.\"  He added: \"I love the landscape of (the character's) adventures. I've always loved the natural world and I particularly relished depicting the Hundred Acre Wood (the imaginary forest where Pooh Bear lives) through the different seasons for this new book.\" According to the illustrator, the success of Milne's original books continue to be popular today because the characters are so relatable. \"The stories and characters appear quite simple but there is a surprising amount of depth to the characters -- they are fully rounded. I think a large part of the attraction is we recognize the characters as like ourselves or our friends -- we all know someone who is grumpy like Eeyore or bouncy like Tigger,\" said Burgess. Meanwhile British award-winning author Jeanne Willis, who wrote the new tale about spring in Pooh Bear's world, said A.A. Milne's series deserves to be celebrated because of its ageless appeal.\"It is not just children who read about Pooh Bear, a lot of adult's read the books for nostalgia. I have a friend that's just five years older than Winnie-the-Pooh that still loves reading about him,\" Willis told CNN. \"The innocence in the book is charming, and the characters show that it is okay to make mistakes and learn from them. It was because of Winnie-the-Pooh that I started writing. I thought that if a bear can write poetry, so can I.\" Winnie the Pooh: The Best Bear in All the World, the latest collection of Pooh Bear's adventures, published on October 6.

{"_id":"Woman with severe eating disorder wins right to refuse forced feedings","articleText":" (CNN)A woman battling a severe eating disorder won the right to refuse forced feedings in a New Jersey court on Monday, according to her attorney. Judge Paul Armstrong announced that the court recognized her right to \"live free from medical intervention\" in an opinion delivered in Morris County Superior Court, according to attorney Edward d'Alessandro.The order came after state agencies moved to force the 29-year-old woman, referred to in court documents as A.G., to use a feeding tube, which would deliver liquid nutrition through her nose directly into her stomach, as part of her care. The legal battle was set in motion when her court-appointed guardian sought an order allowing her to enter palliative care, since feeding methods put in place over the summer led to heart failure, which she has now recovered from. The woman had recently ripped out her PICC line and had repeatedly refused further treatment, according to court documents. A PICC line is essentially an IV tube used to administer treatments such as chemotherapy or, as in this case, saline nutrition. The state's Department of Human Services and its Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services opposed the motion. Armstrong's ruling now means the woman can enter palliative care, where the goal is to relieve the symptoms of her illness and improve her quality of life, which was her wish.However, the state argued in a legal brief that \"This is in essence, permitting A.G. to die.\"The Department of Human Services referred questions to the state attorney general's office, which did not respond to a request for comment. The woman has had anorexic thoughts since the age of 5, according to court documents. With incidents dating as far back as her high school years, she has repeatedly refused to cooperate with treatment and has been hospitalized multiple times for her disorder. The disorder, involving both eating restriction and bingeing and purging, left her weighing only 60 pounds when she was admitted to the hospital this summer.The state argues that the woman is delusional, claiming that she \"suffers from a mental disorder that, among other things, includes a distorted view of reality, and a false view of her own weight and prognosis.\"  In another area of its brief, the state writes as an example of her thinking that she believes any weight above 65 to 67 pounds is \"obese.\" Additionally, her guardian testified that the woman did not want a feeding tube because \"she did not want to get fat,\" according to court documents. According to d'Alessandro, the woman will still receive medication, counseling and pastoral support through her palliative care. \"My client is very grateful that the court recognized her right to self-determination and is allowing her to live free from intervention,\" d'Alessandro said.","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/nj-woman-eating-disorder-legal-case/index.html"}

These countries might do the sameThe Republican presidential nominee's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, brushed off the comment, saying Trump was \"channeling the frustrations\" of many Americans over the email issue. But it resonated with others.\"That's what dictators do,\" Sen. Chris Coons (D) of Delaware said on CNN's \"New Day\" Monday morning.So what would Clinton do to Trump if she becomes president? Joel Benenson, her campaign's chief strategist, said on \"New Day\" that she would \"probably ignore him.\"\"I think if she becomes president, he will be a footnote in history.\"Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET.

See more here. (CNN)Actor, producer, screenwriter and costume designer Xavier Dolan is a man of many talents. But it's his prodigious directing skills that have made him one of the film industry's most exciting ones to watch.In 2014, his film \"Mommy\" was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and was awarded the festival's Jury Prize. And just last year, his video for Adele's \"Hello\" became a pop culture phenomenon. Now, the 27-year-old is working on his latest project, \"The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,\" in Montreal, Canada.His English-language debut, the film features a star-studded cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, Susan Sarandon and Thandie Newton, as well as \"Game of Thrones\" star Kit Harington, who plays the lead.

{"_id":"Yemenite children: Were babies taken from Jewish migrants?","articleText":"For decades, hundreds of immigrants into Israel -- mainly Jews from Yemen and other Arab countries -- have claimed their children were kidnapped. CNN investigates some of the moving stories that have become known as the Yemenite Children Affair. (CNN)Jacqueline Fedida prays she will meet her son before she dies.He was born on June 3, 1954, while Fedida was sedated. When she woke up, doctors told her that her son didn't survive the birth. But Fedida was never given a birth or death certificate. And she was never allowed to see the body.\"'Show me my son,'\" I told them. \"'Why can't I see him?' And they told me, 'Lady, we threw him out.' In those words. 'Lady, we threw him out.'\"When she arrived at home, she looked at her husband and told him what she felt in her heart. \"I told my husband that this boy didn't die. He's not dead. Never in my life have I felt that he died.\"Some claim children were soldFedida came to Israel from Morocco in 1948 amid a wave of mass immigration. The newly-created state's population doubled in three years. For decades, hundreds of these new immigrants -- mostly Jews from Yemen and other Arab countries, known as Mizrachim -- claimed their children were kidnapped. Some say the children were sold to Eastern European Jews, known as Ashkenazim, or Holocaust survivors who couldn't have children of their own. It is known as the Yemenite Children Affair.Before Fedida gave birth, doctors had asked her to sign a few papers. Fedida, who didn't speak a word of Hebrew, signed without asking questions. Years later, she believes she signed adoption papers.\"Curse them? I won't curse them. God will curse them. But when [the doctor] gave me the papers to sign, he didn't once look me in the eyes.\"Three different committees have investigated the affair -- the Bahlul-Minkowski Committee in the 1960s, the Shalgi Committee in the 1980s, and the Kedmi Inquiry in the 1990s. All three found no evidence of wrongdoing, but the last of these sealed the documents until 2071, fueling rumors of a government cover-up.Following a review of the most recent inquiry, Tzahi Hanegbi, a member of Israel's Knesset, has promised to unseal the documents, allowing the public to review thousands of pages of material.DNA testingAt the same time, a genealogy company called MyHeritage has offered DNA testing to parents and children who believe they may be involved in the Yemenite Children Affair.Yehuda Cantor, who only found out he was adopted when he was 23 years old, spent years researching his origins. He had no birth certificate and knew very little of the first three years of his life.He showed up early, scraping the inside of his cheeks with plastic brushes to collect DNA samples. Like hundreds of others who stood in line, he hopes to find any family members that may be out there. Maybe, he says, he will even figure out why he was given up for adoption.\"In those days, people didn't talk about it. It was hidden. It was a secret, a hidden fact,\" said Cantor. \"Nobody talked about it.\"Through his research, Cantor learned that his mother was a 20-year-old Yemenite woman named Madani Zahari who came to Israel in 1950.\"I found one document without any signature, without any fingerprint, and it says, 'Ms. Zahari gave up her child,' and that's all.\"Cantor says DNA testing is the final step in his investigation. He has compiled a binder full of documents containing all the evidence he has found of his parents and his early life, but historical documents can only take him so far. DNA testing, he hopes, will fill in the rest.It is a hope he shares with many others.'Thousands may be affected'\"It's not just dozens. It's thousands of babies,\" insists Shlomi Hatuka, whose organization Amram has tried to uncover the full story behind the affair. \"The committee got more than 1,000 complaints,\" he said. \"And still there are complaints. We found thousands more who didn't complain because they didn't believe the regime will do something. They don't have any faith in the regime anymore.\"'High infant mortality'Professor Dov Levitan of Bar Ilan University can quote specific cases in the Yemenite Children Affair by name and date. He spent decades researching the stories behind the affair.\"It started as a rumor. Later on it became a myth. For many years, it has become a part of the narrative of the Yemenite Jewry here in Israel,\" Levitan said.He said most of the missing children died because of a high infant mortality rate among new immigrants -- and that other children were lost or sent to the wrong families in crowded immigration centers that relied on group nurseries.Levitan says there has never been a smoking gun, and insists there never will be.\"No one can give a witness, a testimony saying, 'I know, I have seen that this child or another child has been taken away, has been kidnapped, has been illegally taken away from the family,'\" he said. \"And you won't find it. I know those [documents], and you will not find it.\"One man who did find what he was looking for was Gil Grinbaum. He learned he was adopted only much later in life but he never told his adoptive parents he knew. They were Holocaust survivors and they never had any other children.\"As long as they were alive, we were leading a double life,\" Grinbaum said. \"They didn't know until the last day that I know.\"After they passed away, Grinbaum began researching his own origins. He encountered obstacles at every point, he said, especially from the state's adoption agency, which refused to let him see his complete file.\"[The woman at the agency] was holding a small, tiny file with a few documents,\" Grinbaum remembers. \"That's not the big file with everything.\"'100% sure baby was dead'Even without the adoption agency, Grinbaum was able to figure out who his mother was. She was still alive, and he wanted to meet her.She had been told her son had died. At first Grinbaum said he found that hard to believe, but over time, he became convinced.\"I came to the conclusion that she was telling the truth. She had a baby and she left without it, and she cried, and she was 100% sure that the baby was dead.\"With the discovery of his family, Grinbaum has found the closure that so many others still seek. Perhaps the sealed documents from the last inquiry have the answers to the Yemenite Children Affair.Or perhaps people already have in their hearts the only answers they will accept.","articleCategory":["world"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/middleeast/yemenite-jewish-children-israel/index.html"}

That's not what she got. Marcia felt like Obama spent his time apologizing for the country, rather than loving it.

{"_id":"YouTube star on bipolar depression: 'I am proof that nothing can stop you'","articleText":" (CNN)Yousef Erakat is the kind of person who just makes you laugh. The YouTube digital artist has a spark about him; his online pranks spur laughter from his growing audience. But beneath that joyful exterior, Erakat struggled with bipolar disorder and depression. His condition can cause extreme mood swings, from manic emotional highs to the lowest of depressions. Bipolar disorder can be extremely serious. But it can be treated with therapy and medication. The 26-year-old was the youngest of four and was born to Palestinian immigrants. He grew up in a loving home and was surrounded by a supportive family. Erakat first realized he had a problem while attending San Jose State University.  On Friday nights he noticed that everyone was going to parties, drinking and having fun. He was in his room crying to himself and writing poems.\"I was so eager to try and fix myself. I ran to the doctors and hopped on medication thinking that was going to be a quick fix. It took me years to understand that the actual journey was going to happen deep within myself,\" he said.  At the same time, the YouTube artist was looking for new ways to get noticed by the industry in Hollywood. \"I went to the dean at San Jose State University and told her that I was going to create a YouTube channel. She told me that it was the worst decision that I could make for my acting career because no director in Hollywood was going to take me serious,\" he said. The advisor was wrong. In five years, Erakat gained more than 12 million viewers on his YouTube channel fouseyTUBE.  \"When I first started my YouTube channel in 2011, I would re-enact what it was like to live in a Middle Eastern household. I would dress up as my mom, my dad, my brother, my grandmother, my sister. How I got my idea was basically from my childhood. I would literally encompass every little thing that I saw, at family gatherings, at weddings, and I would bring them to life in a YouTube video,\" he said.But as Erakat's YouTube following grew, his depression got worse. The prankster decided it was time to get serious with his audience and with himself. In 2015, he opened up on his vlog channel DOSEofFOUSEY about his private struggle. \"I just decided to be completely open with them and to tell them the struggles that I go through, and surprisingly it was the best decision I ever made in my career,\" he said.He also described his physical transformation. \"I woke up, and I was 236 pounds. I was unhappy with what I looked like. I was eating junk food. I was unhappy with what I felt like on the inside. I was living with depression and bipolar,\" he said.Erakat went to rehab, began a 90-day workout program and lost 49 pounds. He ended up in the best shape of his life.\"I was working out, and I was listening to motivational videos. I was pumping myself with positive aspiration and positive philosophy of life. I started to wake up early. I was forcing myself to do the stuff that I didn't want to do.\"His battle with depression will last the rest of his life, he said. But right now, there's no doubt he's winning. \"Just because you have a mental disorder, it doesn't mean that you are limited in your success in life. It doesn't mean that you are restricted in receiving the blessings of life. So don't sell yourself short. You can get through it,\" he said.The California native recently starred in a horror zombie series called \"YouTube Red's Fight of the Living Dead.\" He also has a role opposite Tyler Perry in the latest Madea installment, \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" releasing later this month. \"I am proof that nothing can stop you.\"","articleCategory":["health"],"docUrl":"www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/health/turning-points-yousef-erakat/index.html"}
{"_id":"Young ISIS recruit: I was blinded by love","articleText":"Oklahoma City (CNN)His friends know him as \"Mo.\" And he is the most unlikely ISIS recruit you will ever meet.In fact, in virtually every way Mo, whose real name is Muhammad Dakhlalla, was an ordinary and typical American college student. But he was arrested with a fellow Mississippi State University student just over a year ago, trying to board a plane to go join the notorious terrorist organization. How did that happen? \"Where do you want me to start exactly?\" he said, laughing somewhat nervously, as he sat recently for the first extensive, tell-all interview with CNN in a federal prison. Today, Mo, just 24, is at the start of an eight-year prison sentence for trying to join and help ISIS. But he is hardly a radical Muslim extremist. Remarkably, he said he got into this whole mess because he fell in love.Falling into troubleBorn and raised in Mississippi, Mo is the youngest of four brothers and has both Muslim and non-Muslim friends. He dated very little and had few girlfriends until his senior year at Mississippi State. There, he met and fell for Jaelyn Young, a sophomore studying chemistry who in high school was an honors student and cheerleader.\"In the beginning of my senior year I met this lady,\" Mo said, recalling his strong feelings for her. \"She was beautiful and things like that,\" he said, \"but also another thing that I find attractive in a woman is one who's, you know, bright, intelligent, open-minded. And that's how I got to know her a bit. We started hanging out. She not only was interested in me, but she had told me prior to us being together that she was interested in Islam.\"Islam is the religion in which Mo grew up. His father, Oda, is an imam, who originally hailed from Bethlehem in the West Bank before settling decades ago in Mississippi. Mo's father, along with his mother, Lisa, a New Jersey-born woman who converted to Islam, helped found and build the Islamic Center of Mississippi in Starkville. Not long after they became a couple, Jaelyn converted to Islam, and it was a complete surprise to Mo.\"At one point, you know, she told me that she's very serious about Islam, and she wanted to become a Muslim,\" he said. \"Then on that day when she did, actually it was a big surprise for me. My parents actually found out first that she became a Muslim. I was actually at the mosque at that time, saying my prayers. And I came back to find out that she had become Muslim, and I had no idea.\"Then came another surprise, he said. \"A few weeks later, and I never said anything to her about this, or, like, tried to, you know, force her ... she decided to wear the full hijab or niqab by herself. Like, it was on her own -- her own choice. You know, she was wearing it from her head and full robe that you typically see of Muslim women.\" The niqab she wore covered every part of her in a black shroud, leaving only slits for her eyes visible, according to Mo's family. Jaelyn was changing fast, he said, becoming stricter and more conservative in all parts of her life. \"As far as, like, the rapid stages that she was going through, I may have, should have been, like, scratching my head a little bit. I should have had ... a skeptical, like, analysis of, like, 'OK, maybe we've gone a little too fast,' \" he said laughing. But, he said, he was deeply in love. \"And, you know, that love can ultimately ... blind out your intelligence, your reasoning. I believe that. I mean, without that love there, I don't believe I would be here today, with my charge and talking to you today. ... I wouldn't have even considered it at all.\" The Federal Bureau of Prisons rarely grants access to convicted felons such as Mo. CNN's interview was an exception, an agreement between the Department of Justice, CNN and Mo. His words shed light on just how powerful ISIS' online propaganda can be for American youths. Jaelyn, who was also convicted in the case, has refused to speak to CNN.Pursuing her conversion and new religion, Jaelyn went to the Internet. And there, she found ISIS.Jaelyn merely showed Mo the videos -- the clips did the rest.\"It started out with when ... she first became Muslim, you know, she wanted to learn more. ... I'm not sure how she came across some of the videos that she did at first, but I remember, like, some of them. Like, one of the first ones I remember seeing, a video that how ISIS came to be. And it was basically mentioning ... historical struggles in the Middle East. And then somehow it ties that back into, you know, everything is, like, the Western society's fault. You would see a lot of non-Muslims using like, vulgar language, and a whole lot of slander on top of that.\"Mo followed Jaelyn's lead. \"When she showed me that video, I think it's just kind of like -- brought a tenseness in her and ... really strong anger in her. And she expressed those things to me. And, you know, me being in love with her, I felt those same things I guess, just because she was feeling it.\"Mo said the goal was never to take part in jihad or commit violence -- but rather to help out as fellow Muslims in the newly forming Muslim state. \"When she first looked at these videos, she had  ... a strong belief that, 'OK, this is the group to really help out, you know, the Muslims.' \"\"What really, like, stuck out for me were well, what I thought from the videos were people helping rebuild towns -- people helping the needy --  what we consider humanitarian.\" Crazy as it sounds, the young lover said he did what his partner did. \"Throughout the time she convinced me of that ... I don't know exactly how, you know, it came to be, but I know that she knew I loved her at that time, and I was just going to follow whatever she said, and I felt like she knew that, like, I was going to follow anything that she said.\"They began communicating through the Internet with people they thought were in ISIS, in Syria. In one note, Mo wrote: \"I'm good with computers, I'm good with I.T., I can help here.\"'I won't be coming back'According to the FBI, Jaelyn reached out to a contact she thought would help her and Mo travel to Turkey, cross the border into Syria and join ISIS. The two secretly married, began an intensive preparation period and bought one-way plane tickets to Istanbul.And on August 8, 2015, Mo and Jaelyn packed their bags. He wrote a touching goodbye letter to his parents. The first lines read: \"I'm sorry. I love you. I've decided to leave and I won't be coming back.\" A small heart is scrawled at the bottom of the page. Then the couple went to the airport near Columbus, Mississippi. They got as far as the boarding gate, and then they were arrested. At that moment, Mo said, everything changed. \"Oh, my heart sank,\" he said. \"I felt like my whole body shut down. Just because, I was thinking to myself, 'It's, like, what now, what the heck are we doing?' \"The FBI said both Jaelyn and Mo confessed at that moment. But they didn't have to. It turns out the online ISIS recruiter who had been helping make arrangements for the couple was in fact an FBI employee.This past spring they both pleaded guilty, and they were sentenced in August. Mo was given a lighter sentence, citing his cooperation with authorities. Jaelyn, considered by authorities to be the mastermind, was sentenced to 12 years. Throughout the interview, Mo never once mentioned Jaelyn's name. He also finds it difficult to speak about the other woman in his life -- his mother. She was suffering from cancer when he was arrested, and she died earlier this year.\"It is one of the biggest regrets that I have in my life -- still haunts me to this day,\" he said. \"That I would prefer this woman that I've only been together with for under a year, and lie to my mother about where I was going. And my mother's always been supportive throughout my life, you know, I never felt like, you know, I needed to do anything behind her back. I could always be full-front honest to her. But all it took was getting caught up for love of a lady, and that I threw -- throw your life away.\"        He also regrets that during this time of confusion, especially about religion, he failed to reach out to his dad, an imam who would have never taught his son to kill or hurt anyone.\"I wish I'd reached out to the Muslim community. I wish I'd just reached out to my dad, because my dad's very knowledgeable in this stuff. Not only in Islam, but the Middle Eastern politics. You know, if I had just asked him, he would just illuminate me on what was really happening with this group.\"Asked about homegrown terrorists, or those in ISIS who have viciously killed innocents across Europe and in Syria, Mo said he would never wish to be part of anything like that. \"They have a lack of understanding of Islam, because the main focus of Islam is peace, you know. Submit your will to God,\" he said. \"ISIS, you know, kind of twists that to say that, you know, 'If we're doing things for the will of God, you know, you gotta come and join us as, you know, because we're the real Muslim community.' \" \"I feel like that I should owe people back to say, 'Hey, don't do what I did.' That's not what they are doing over there. What ISIS is doing over there -- that's not Islam. ... If you ever feel like you're thinking about doing this, contact the Muslim community. They're going tell you, 'No, this is a whole terrible idea.'\"Today, Mo is not bitter; in fact, he said he is relieved he was caught. He knows that had he made it to Syria there is a good chance he would be dead. He remains a devout Muslim. He will be 32 when he leaves prison.
