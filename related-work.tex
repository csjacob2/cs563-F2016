\tab Previous work in the area of privacy within Facebook was explored by Ghazinour\cite{ghazinour2016yourprivacyprotector}, who developed a machine learning tool, YourPrivacyProtector, in order to suggest privacy settings for users. The authors harvested data from Facebook profiles, primarily user profile information and privacy settings from photo albums, and based on the data compiled, used it to learn about the privacy settings already in place, and made recommendations on what other profiles should do based on similar data. This study focused primarily on the user's personal profile information.

\tab The ability to select better, or more relevant, privacy settings, is explored by Naini\cite{naini2015}. In this paper, they approach a similar idea we are proposing, a method for predicting the privacy setting for a post at creation time, based on a set of features within the post itself. By allowing automatic privacy-setting assistance, they hypothesize a potential decrease in leaked information to the wrong audience and increased security and privacy for a user.

\tab Ideally, we would like to build on the research developed by Naini et al, and attempt to develop the application that could predict and apply the recommended privacy setting for the user.
